75,Alprazolam,How I travelled in time by one day (with Xanax),"Okay so its jan 28 4pm took some phenibut, then drank a tiny bit alcohol 6 hours later. Okay go to sleep and wake up late around 12 pm.

Now it’s 29th january and I want to go to sleep early and had some Xanax and basically I have tried it before but haven’t done it in like 5 months. Strength is not specified, I didn’t ask my dealer, last time it was stamped 2 at the end so I guessed it was that but this time It had g3722 stamped in or something, I googled it and it mentioned 2mg.

Was pretty late, needed to sleep drank like half glass of wine (small) took 1/4 of a pill and hour later not much. Then was like Fuck it the other 3/4.

Started falling sleepy

Wake up at two pm next day and think fml I should’ve set an alarm. And something is strange. Don’t know what it is. Look at the Callander it’s 31st jan? I’m really confused at this point like what the fook.

Really confused.

Okay so I made a post about this already but just realised how bad my calculations were, I actually slept a lot longer than I thought and it was 32 hours (went to sleep at 4am and woke up at 2 the very next day) I am currently how alone and basically had to recollect everything by looking at my phone history etc. 

My record tbh and I’m not into the “downer” things like that. It feels so strange that I think in that time I was up but I just can’t remember if.

96,Methamphetamine,Theory: Are many popular rappers doing meth not mdma?,"So this may seem kinda random but I’ve thought about it a lot. Most mdma on the street isn’t trust worthy, most rappers I highly doubt test their drugs. They probably also mostly buy from past hood connects which most likely aren’t selling mdma.

Not just that but context in the songs. So obviously a lot of rappers didn’t really live the gangster life or rarely did if they did, plenty partially did but the life style they describe and popping mdma does not line up. Like could you imagine robbing someone or doing a drive by for Christ’s sake on mdma? I’d cry if I killed a spider on that shit and I’m into hunting deer.

A lot of these rappers actually doing meth makes a lot more sense in a lot of ways. For example if you’re living in the hood meth could honestly make it way more bearable while still keeping you on point. Heroin makes anything bearable but you aren’t on point, something important if you’re involved in the crime underworld. Meth also can make committing crimes, if you let it, feel very normalized. Most rappers when discussing their “molly” the only thing they say that is even remotely like mdma is the good sex but imo meth is the ultimate sex drug. Just a theory and I might be wrong but with how much fake mdma exists out there and how far out from the tough guy, ghetto lifestyle that is mdma, it’s not the craziest idea.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abdk16/theory_are_many_popular_rappers_doing_meth_not/

402,PSA,"A quick PSA about Hood Scientists/Gurus, Buying from friends and general drug safety.","Going into the new year there are a couple of things I want to stop seeing:

1. People listening to friends/dealers who think they know more than scientists and basically tell you to ignore your own research.
2. People thinking that their drugs are safe to use because they bought it from a good friend.
3. Just making bad decisions with drugs.

If your friend/dealer is telling you things that directly conflict with your research and goes against Everything you know, you should question him. If his info isn't backed up by sources and its purely anecdotal you should gtfo as fast as you can. I would never trust drugs from someone who is so misinformed and not willing to learn. 

You may think this is unheard-of or uncommon but I've seen it so many times. People that have tripped so many times on psychedelics and think that they know more than anyone else because what they've seen on psyches is the **truth**. Fuck ya truth, go on erowid, get informed.

Speaking of getting informed, just because your good friends with your dealer doesn't mean they can't sell you bunk/dangerous shit. Sure they might not be trying to purposely sell you harmful drugs but they can be misinformed themselves and receive bunk product unkowingly. Always test your shit no matter who you get it from. It can even be from a top tier vendor with tons of good reviews. **ALWAYS.** **TEST.** **YOUR.** **SHIT.**

Also just please be responsible with your drug usage. We already have too many people dying on our hands. Lets go into 2019 caring more about harm reduction instead of getting completely fucked up.

One last thing before I go. I would advise people to only take MDMA with people they trust. People really underestimate how powerful MDMA is. It can make your perception of a person totally change. Literally a person you can hate the most when sober can turn into your best friend on MDMA. You may think that your eyes are open and you're just now seeing this person for what they really are but you're not. Stay safe friends and have a happy new years!

491,LSD,Negative experiences with MDMA (or acid) and anxiety medications.,"Hey guys,

This is indeed a throwaway. I just wanted to share my experience and hopefully hear from some of you about some negative interactions you had. I'm (now) aware of the incredibly useful drug interactions sites that people use, and I'm not really looking for advice...just your guys' thoughts and experiences.

This post was actually inspired by my recently discovered inability to take Tylenol cold/flu medication because it interferes with the magical sleeping pills I've been using for the past year (Trazodone). I'm also taking Pristiq to prevent panic attacks. I would like to ween myself off both of these, but attempts have been made (according to my doctor's instructions) and they were \*wildly\* unsuccessful. Anyway, Trazodone interferes with some chemical in cold/flu medication that can cause the dreaded \*\*serotonin syndrome\*\* which is something I'm pretty sure I experienced once already and is the cause of my newfound drug interaction mini-neurosis.

Long story short, I made an inconceivably idiotic mistake and took 100mg of MDMA instead of the intended 10mg. It was literally just a retarded math error that caused the worst night of my life. This was my first time, by the way. I spent the rest of that day and most of that night puking, sweating, and shivering...topped off with a relentlessly powerful headache like nothing I've ever experienced. I thought I was dying and in those few moments of lucidity I would grab my phone and contemplate calling 911...something I didn't end up doing. I do know it was good MDMA because it was from the same batch my friend had already used, and he's pretty familiar with purity quality and whatnot.

That was only one-half of my mistake. The other was not looking up drug interactions. I was taking Trazodone then along with another drug I can't remember the name of that was for my panic attacks (which I now use Pristiq for). I found out later neither of those drugs should be used with MDMA or acid.

Anyway I just wanted to share my experience and maybe scare some of you straight (just kidding for the love of god don't kill me). I really, \*really\* want to be able to roll again because I remember the first half-hour after taking my super dose I felt as good as I felt after doing my first line of coke. I can only imagine how amazing it would be for that feeling to last for hours. I've read a few stories (on /r/drugs as well as some other forums) describing similar interactions except they're never as bad as mine. Usually they just describe a muted roll instead of a night of agony. Do any of you guys have any similar experiences? Is it possible what I experienced wasn't even serotonin syndrome? I did actually describe the night to my doctor afterwards and he said that was most likely what it was and that I should've called an ambulance...

When I do this, a couple of things happen:

 - Loss of personality.
 - Feel very heavy when still.
 - Lie about the effects i’m experiencing (often say i’m hallucinating), even though I feel no need to or want to lie for attention.
 - feel like I simultaneously have a ‘sober’ consciousness and a ‘medicated’ consciousness.
 - can feel every joint I move loudly creak

We took it at 8-9 and are pretty much off the comedown now, so we tripped through the new year. It was an amazing experience that things like LSA and LSH don't really compare to. We came up with crazy metaphors for our lives and stories that we never would do sober, and went on many ""adventures"" and ""side stories which lead to nowhere, but it's okay because the story is still going on"". It is honestly thrilling, and this drug gives me all the ""highs"" that I could want. Extreme rushes throughout the body all night long which felt like a constant massage in some way. Personally, I could compare most of my trips to Indian styled artwork. I wouldn't say that I entered another universe, but I absolutely entered another world. I would love to do this drug again and learn more about it and explore it, although I feel that mostly I don't have the time. 12 hours is ages for the experience, but when you're on the high you watch the minutes roll by and complain that there's not enough free time away from the distractions of the world. I've had stomach cramping pain throughout the night which is odd (I'm male), but it's mostly gone now. It was as if we had a whole new life where we could explore ourselves again, and we did (albeit feeling strange about it). Thanks for all the advice on tripping, Reddit. It was an experience.

Skyrim was very fun, too. Our stoned friend was just sitting there being so dumb about everything and it was nonstop fun all night. We also played Portal later on which was downright impossible even though I've completed it countless times. 

TL;DR: Acid is insanely good and I absolutely recommend it. It was very trippy and to be quite honest ""strong"" at 55ug. Happy new years! This experience made acid both of our favourite drugs. Not going to be regulars, but by far, we will try and find some time to have these experiences in the future!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abhg8u/our_first_time_tripping_on_acid_last_night/
743,Methamphetamine,My review of meth after trying it once.,"So currently I'm pretty fucked off this stuff. The ROA i chose was smoking. I must say, it's pretty good. My biggest question going into it was how was it gonna compare to adderall because I've done a fuck ton of that in my past. It definitely resembles a high dose of adderall pretty closely but I'd say I don't tweak as much and it's also at keast 5x more euphoric. But it truly does resemble it quite well imo. A good way to start off a new year I guess you could say. I'll have to see what jerking off on this is like at some point in this binge. Overall score from me, 9/10. Will I do it again? Yeah.

btw, a question. I have some xanax and was wondering if they should be efficient in calming me down for some sleep. Benzos can knock me out no matter how drugged out I am so I'm sure they'll do the trick.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abhjss/my_review_of_meth_after_trying_it_once/

826,Cannabinoids,I nearly got my flatmate done for possession and then he had to do a TV interview baked,"This was a couple of years ago at uni. I was living with two flatmates, we'll call them Michael and Beth. Michael had gone down to the London to visit his brother so it was just me and Beth. I was very hungover (standard) and said to Beth I'm going into town to get some fresh air and buy some food etc. I got off the metro and recieved a very distressed phone call from Beth saying ""Dan, Dan, somebody's just broken into the house I don't know what to do""...&gt;!I think you can see where this is going!&lt;.

Now back then me and Michael were pretty big stoners, and because it was just the three of us in a student apartment we didn't make much effort trying to hide the weed, in fact we just put it on a shelf. Because I was preoccupied with the call from Beth I obviously didn't think about this when I called the police (why Beth decided to call me instead of the police herself I'll never know), but in-between thoughts of ""holy shit my flatmate's been murdered"" and ""fuck I've lost all my guitars"" on the way back to my flat it did start to creep into my head. It was actually a much closer call then I thought.

Basically Michael had decided to travel up from London a day early (what a surprise). But his phone had run out of battery, so didn't tell us that he was coming. In the midst of all this, Michael didn't know that Beth was in the house at all. So he went upstairs, had a shit, went back downstairs, rolled himself a joint, smoked said joint, crashed on the sofa, then heard two bangs on the door and Beth sprinting down the stairs, followed by two big burly police officers entering the living room asking if he should be there. He was obviously stoned because when I arrived I could smell it on him, and his eyes were red. But luckily the police officers were too busy laughing at us to really care/notice.

On top of all this, the police officers that visited our house were being shadowed by a camera man filming a fly on the wall documentary. So I ran home to see my baked flatmate sitting on the stairs to our maisonette giving an interview to this bemused camera guy. You can't make this stuff up. Only thing to do once the police had left was laugh about it over a joint and a cup of tea.

A couple days ago, I took one and went to work, but about four hours after I had taken the vyvanse I had what was supposedly a four minute seizure. I woke up confused and was sent to the hospital where I had multiple tests done. None of the doctors could tell why I seized and I told all of them about the vyvanse, but it didn’t even pique anyone’s interest, nobody was even slightly suspicious that it was the vyvanse that caused the seizure. 

Now the day before I didn’t eat or drink well, and the day of I had eaten nothing and only drank about a glass and a half of water. I’m thinking dehydration combined with the vyvanse caused the seizure.

891,Psychedelics,Are there distinctions between a good trip and a bad trip?,"I took acid for the first time yesterday in the most haphazard way possible (suddenly just decided to go for it after flirting with the idea for a few months) and overall I found it to be one of the most profound and eye opening experiences of my entire life. It helped me make a lot of connections in my life that I knew were there but was too scared or anxious to really acknowledge sober, and ultimately I had a whole lot of fun and helped me gain a little bit of peace.

While I consider my trip to be a good trip, I can't deny that new years absolutely fucking sucked, it was a terrible experience and I had a lot of intensely negative energy around me the whole night. Interestingly though, my reasoning that saved me from what I imagine to be uncontrollable terror is me telling myself that trips aren't good or bad, its what I make of it. I took this horrible situation and approached it in a meaningful way and overall I feel like the experience changed me for the better. 

What I want to know is if my reasoning is true or false. Are there are only trips, and they are only good or bad depending on if we let them become good or bad? Or is there is a distinction between the two and i was way off mark last night? Thank you guys for listening, I'm still trying to figure a lot out because I was alone mentally (I had others with me but they were killing the vibe so I had to go my own way and explore), however I figured there's no better people to go to help for about drugs than drug users.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abjrqw/are_there_distinctions_between_a_good_trip_and_a/

942,Antidepressants,Positive escitalopram (Cipralex/Lexapro) experiences for high-functioning individuals,"I might be starting 2019 off with my first anti-depressant. My GP has suggested escitalopram based on my symptoms. Over the past 3-4 months (out of no where) I have experienced a few panic attacks and very high baseline anxiety. I also experienced mid-level depression that has fluctuated to periods of major depression. 

Essentially I've begun to get anxious in normal situations (talking to co-workers) and have experienced a strong diminishment in enjoyment of normal activities (my job, sports, etc). 

I believe that multiple life events in a short timeframe have created this situation (marriage, new home, new job - within a 12 month period). 

I'm looking for any experiences that high-functioning individuals have had on this anti-depressant. What I mean by ""high-functioning"" are just people that are actually working full-time jobs, have a supportive family, have friends and interests outside of work, are eating correctly, are working out and taking care of their bodies, are not abusing drugs, etc. As the research I have done suggests that SSRIs work significantly better for those in a high-functioning state (but experiencing a depressed/anxious disorder). 

Please comment on what escitalopram has done for you. 

Specifically looking for comments on: 

* Anxiety 
* Depression
* Motivation
* Happiness 
* Cognition
* Extraversion

955,2m2b (2-Methyl-2-Butanol),2m2b (2-Methyl-2-Butanol) Side Effects and My Experience,"Here's what literally none of the other posts tell you..

Way too sedative. Every time now that I've experimented all I wanted to do was go to bed. And I'd sleep for 12 hours waking up still tired and under the effects. I'd stay up for a few hours and yet again feel tired and ready to go back to bed..

Urinary retention. Reminds me of when I used to take opiates. It's like your bladder muscles are too relaxed to work. It's frustrating. I know I have the urge to piss but can't.

The taste is absolutely foul and lingers on your breath for hours, up until the next day regardless of what you eat or drink after. It sort of reminds me of the menthol taste of Benzedrex. It doesn't seem to suspend/mix in water, it simply floats on top which makes it impossible to dilute and mask the taste.

Rebound anxiety, seems to be worse than either benzos or ethanol. I've found myself redosing just to keep the anxiety at bay.

On more than one occasion my body has pretty much immediately rejected the substance. Causing me to wretch up the nasty solvent which then causes more wretching from the foul taste. Getting it down is pretty bad, throwing it back up is beyond terrible. Since it doesn't suspend in water it'll come up and coat your throat. So your stomach will be empty but the substance is still in your throat causing you to continue gagging even though there's nothing to come out.

Makes food taste bland/shitty, lowers appetite. This is likely a rebound effect. When I'm under the effects taste is relatively normal. It definitely doesn't enhance taste like ethanol.

I do not experience more euphoria compared to ethanol as many posts have stated. It feels much more like a benzodiazapine than ethanol. Extremely physically sedating and hardly psychoactive at all.(perhaps that's why it was used as an anesthestic a few decades ago?)



I would much prefer regular ethanol. I honestly don't get nearly as many side effects with regular booze, contrary to the many posts I've read on 2m2b. The only reason I've tried so long with this substance is that I am on probation and unable to drink. That, and from all of the posts I read it's ""just like ethanol but lasts longer""! And has ""less side effects""! Hah! Don't trust everything you read I guess. I wish I would've gotten Butanediol to try instead. And I wish I wouldn't have bought a fuckin litre of this shit.

Note: My doses certainly weren't anything massive. The most I've taken is about 13ml over the course of 8 hours. Most recently it's been more like 4-6ml. Another thing I've discovered is a sort of ceiling effect for anything over 4-5ml. The sedation and sleepiness may increase but intoxication, at least mentally doesn't seem to. It might make a good sleep aid if it weren't for the horrific taste and lingering drowsiness.",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abkkx7/2m2b_2methyl2butanol_side_effects_and_my/

Day one of the festival I took one tab of acid, dropped L over 30 times. 
Day two I decided to roll. This was my 5th or 6th time rolling. I weighed out a point and crushed it up in a bag so I can dose it throughout the night. 
Around 7:30pm I decided to take my first pinky dip. 
Around 8pm I started to feel it. 
Also I hadn’t eaten in around 6 hours from when I dosed. 
It all happened so quickly I will do my best to explain it. 
We were very very very close to the front. 
It was during the last few minutes of 4Bs set (I do not like 4B at all he is not garbage in my opinion) I was not having that good of a time but I knew the rest of the night was going to be fun. In the last few minutes of his set his lights were going crazy with red and white strobe lights. It was fucking with me so I looked down and when I looked back up it happened. Next thing I knew my friends were shaking me and I was laying down and my girlfriend had grabbed my face and that’s when I started coming back. My friends carried me back a little bit and to the side where it was nice and cool. I threw up a few times and finally felt better. I left main-stage and went and got some food. I felt way better after eating. 

I think my blood sugar was just low and the heat and the lights all got to me. It scares me because this has never happened to anyone close to me and I have quite a bit of molly left. 

TL:DR, I took my first dose of molly and fainted. Hadn’t really ate that day. If someone could give me a detailed explanation of what happened, I would greatly appreciate it. 

I also test all my substances before I ingest. So I know it was MDMA. I try to be very safe about drug use.

1026,Cannabis,Weed makes me lesbian," I’m a straight male when sober, and certain weed strains make me feel like a woman, and lesbian too. Anyone else experienced this? I’d like to hear other people’s experiences and strains used.

For me, I experience a relaxation of my inhibitions such that I can find the “female” inside me, hidden underneath thick layers of masculine shrouding (and I suspect most men have this). I’ve had this experience while being with my wife, who is bisexual, and she facilitates the process to make me feel like a lesbian woman (I don’t ever get the gay/interest in men effect as I’ve read others do). I can even experience female-like orgasms, where my whole body orgasms just by touching myself everywhere (arms, legs, body), similar to how some women can do it.

We also tried watching lesbian porn, which was an out-of-this-world experience. I literally felt as if I projected myself into one of the women in the video, and my wife was the other, and I was having sex with her as a woman… super erotic.

I’ve only ever experienced this with the strains Girl Scout Cookies (vaped) and Tangie Banana Surprise (edible). I’ve tried many other strains (hooray for being in a legal state with easy access); they give me various types of intense euphoric sexual experiences, but not the gender bending experience.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ableu6/weed_makes_me_lesbian/
1027,Dissociatives,Going for the hole (Special K),"I got a G of K yesterday, did 4 tiny bumps (like 2 keys worth) whilst a bit drunk (didn’t want to die but still couldn’t resist) and felt about halfway to the hole, probably due to my drunkenness, low tolerance and bodyweight. I really want to hole tonight though.

Gonna have a nice warm shower, chop up a big line and snort it all at once (half in each nostril) then lie down in bed and listen to some music. I’m going to try blindfolding myself but keeping my eyes open, I’ve heard that can increase the dissociative effects. 

Any tips/advice for how to ensure that I wonk into another dimension for a good hour?

Update: 

just coming down, about an hour after I snorted the k. Trip was more physical than visual, in the sense that I felt as if I was falling through a series of very dark spaces/landscapes, but the details were very vague. I had the sensation of sliding down a tunnel or falling through the floor multiple times. Prior to that I had felt almost waves of anaesthesia washing over me, then felt as if my bed had sunk into the floor of my room. It was very enjoyable though, and I feel as if I have truly experienced the hole now. The music recommendations were extremely good! 

When I started coming down I slowly realised that my nose was totally fucked and I was breathing through my mouth. My mouth is also extremely dry now. I sneezed several times and then got up to go and blow my nose. Every step felt as if I couldn’t bend my legs, and that my torso was being dragged by my legs. Time seemed incredibly distorted. 

Overall a great experience, Thanks for the help and encouragement :)

1142,Opioids,Oxynorm ... what is it really.,"Two days ago I went partying with my girlfriend, a friend of mine and another chick. 
My girlfriend and my friend took lsd and started rolling pretty cool. We went to this cool techno club, pretty oppressing for the basment  (techno like it's hard to find elsewhere) and way lighter / cooler upstairs. I was afraid the trip would go south if we spent too long in the basement part, but thanks to the club policy, not everyone could get in which make the party a lot less packed so more suitable for acid. The oppression was only die to music and strobos and figs, so that's something I chose.
They really enjoyed it and I was glad, even if we spent less time underground than I wish we had. They liked it upstairs a little better ...
I had in my pocket 4 pills of 5mg oxynorm, and I wanted to taste the atmosphere sober before taking anything. And I did. I ordered a vodka red bull just to chill and get my energy up, and it kind of did the trick. I spent 1h30, 2h just with a beer and this vodka and red bull.
Then, I decided to chew two of them pills, and 5 minutes later, two others.
It felt good, not very powerful, but after 20 minutes I think it kicked in.
I went higher and higher, I felt good, more rested than I should have felt (I went partying the night before) and at ease.
 Thing is something like 1h30 2h after I took them,  I felt bad, like I would faint. So I went to sit down. It was a good thing, my girlfriend went and sit beside me while I was starting to see a thin white veil (not too strong but still present) sweating cold sweat and wanting to puke a little. It went better after I stayed sitting for 20 minute max and drank a coke.
Then I went back dancing, everything fine, still high and carried by the music (especially downstairs). Only thing was slight nausea but it was ok. It was fun to notice that sitting down and starring made me wanna sleep so hard, while when I went to the dancefloor it was so cool (also it made me forget about the pain in the back from standing for to long). I needed a second break during the night because of the drugs maybe, but or tiredness too I'd say.
The most embarrassing was when we took the transport back to where we slept. I felt more and more nauseous, and the orange juice we drank after we left the club felt heavier. To put it shortly I had to puke a little to early, before the metro stopped, and it was hard to retain. I puked a second time when we got of the metro at the right stop.
I think I took too much of it, maybe. It's hard to know when it just does those bad side effect in spikes  (nausea and queasiness). 
Don't know if I'd do it again ... probably not since I enjoy this atmosphere sober and opioids kind of scare me. It was not a bad trip, but it was a bit scary when I needed to sit down ... happened the first time I took half a Molly too.

Has anyone experienced things like this ? Do you even know those pills ?

Anyway, happy New year, and stay safe :).

1149,Cannabis,Does anyone else wonder if weed is too strong these days?,"For context, I'm in my late twenties and live in the UK. I started smoking weed when I was about 15 and generally speaking, the stuff has always been very strong (often from Amsterdam). 

I stopped smoking for ages because I found it either fun or extremely anxiety inducing depending on the circumstances and didn't like the bad experience. Now I smoke every now and then by myself and generally small amounts.

While a lot of my friends smoked back then, barely any do now. Most people I know tell me that weed just makes them anxious and self conscious. I'm talking 90% of the people who are open to drugs and take drugs in my larger social circle can't smoke weed.

I was having a conversation with my parents the other day who were smokers in the late 70's and say that neither them or anyone they hanged out with ever had really negative experiences like I mentioned. My dad was surprised to hear how many people I know who say they found it makes them anxious.

Why is this? I think the main factor is the strength. People are smoking way too much (even a couple hits could be too much for a new smoker), have a bad experience and then is reminded of that every time they smoke. 

Perhaps another factor is other drugs people are taking these days. However my suspicion is strength is the main factor.

Is there any actual research/evidence to support this? I'm interested in getting some answers ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abmwgb/does_anyone_else_wonder_if_weed_is_too_strong/

Admittedly, it fucking rocked at some points - didn't really kick in until 1 am, but holy shit, I didn't know masturbation could be so heightened.  First time I blew my load in 30 minutes and the Vyvanse wasn't at its peak, but the second time, I started jacking off when I felt the beginning of vasoconstriction.  I lasted almost three hours just jerkin it and went to sleep at 7 am.

Woke up before 10 am.  Was super energetic and paranoid that the crash was coming for me.  Well, I was wrong.  I drank a protein shake, ate two eggs and I have been fixing my car ever since (slid into a curb the other day, old BMW, pain in the ass to work on).

The problem has arisen recently.  I'm getting nauseous... like really bad.  I feel this nigh-hungover spinning, I feel cognitive deficits, I am becoming irritable.  I know there isn't a free lunch and an amphetamine binge typically isn't going to be pleasant all in all.

That being said, how the fuck do I combat this?  I feel like I've got so much Vyvanse in my body right now that I may not even sleep right tonight.  I don't have benzos or any other drugs for that matter.  I have my magnesium pills, but they only go so far.  This nausea especially is killing me.

1187,MDMA,Weird first time ecstasy experience,"My friend tried ecstasy for the first time yesterday. He took around 60-70mg and he had quite a weird trip. He first felt dizzy, and then he was semi-conscious/ semi-awake for about three hours. He could barely speak and couldn't move from his chair. He had times when he said he was really happy, but his state was really weird to us. We kept talking to him, trying to make sure he's conscious/ awake. We tried to get him to get up but he said he couldn't stand up/ move. At some point he started crying (I guess he was really emotional, which sometimes happens on e).

He took it with me and a bunch of other friends and we were all behaving like we normally do on e- we were dancing, having a lot of energy, talking, hugging each other etc. We all took the same kind of pills, and, what's more, he shared the pill with a friend of mine who was perfectly fine, so it couldn't have been that the pills were bad. I wonder what could've happened/ if there's any explanation for this. I've heard many experiences with e, but this was really peculiar to me.

1193,Laced Weed,"I'm pretty sure the weed I smoked on new years eve was laced, but I'm not sure with what","Throwaway for obvious reasons

&amp;#x200B;

So I went to a New Years party with my girlfriend last night, and while I was there, I smoked a bowl from a bong, as well as sharing a pipe-full with my gf of what I am almost certain was laced weed. I'm really not sure what it was laced with, however, and I want to figure that out so I know what I accidentally smoked last night. This is going to sound ridiculously stupid but I was actually gifted this weed for free from a random stranger I had just met in a McDonalds bathroom a couple of nights before. We had a really nice heart to heart about life and being kind and generous to everyone you meet. He was a genuinely nice guy, and I guess thats why I let my guard down. He opened up to me about his old opium addiction, and how he used to have to steal from his parents and friends to support his habits. This should have been a big red flag, but when he offered me a bud of his weed as a thank you gift for spending time with him, I gladly took him up. I was already planning on having to go down to a dispensary to pick up some weed for New Years the next day anyways so I was really excited to not have to go anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

He told me the name of the dispensary he supposedly got his weed from, and told me the name of the strain, ""lemon Kush"". I had both been to that dispensary before (which I new was safe), and had smoked that particular strain before (not a personal favourite, it freaked me out a little too much), so combined with the fact that he seemed like a really well-meaning and genuine guy, I trusted the weed. In retrospect, I have no idea why I didn't just go down to the dispensary the next day anyways because the circumstances in which I got this weed were obviously very sketchy.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I left for the party while I was grinding the weed, I noticed it was particularly sticky and hard to break up. A lot of the buds and clumps were holding together  and not breaking up properly. This should have also been a red flag but you all know at this point that I'm a little stupid. Aside from the weed not grinding properly however, the weed did not smell or look any different than the last time I bought it (the last time I bought this strain was from a dispensary, plus I live in Canada, so I know it was safe).

&amp;#x200B;

I had ate dinner with my girlfriend and my parents before leaving for the party, and had had a couple of drinks, but I was not fully drunk yet, only tipsy. When I got to the party, I had mixed myself a rum and coke and drank about half of it. I was then offered a hit from a weed vaporizer (this was not my weed so I'm not sure what strain it was). I then went and packed a bowl of my laced weed and took it all from a bong. The weed was definitely starting to hit me at this point, but I hadn't expected anything yet. Nothing felt out of the usual just yet. My girlfriend and I then went back outside to share a bowl from a pipe together; this was also the laced weed. We shared this bowl 50/50. When we went back inside, she told me that this high did not feel right at all, and that's when it started.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately felt like I was completely out of it. Not only did my body start to feel very odd but I had this strong sense of separation from my surroundings. I all of my body was feeling very tired and out of place, so I had sat down on the couch. It felt as though I was in my own separate world last night both physically and mentally. I couldn't really focus my thoughts on anything much that was going on outside of me. All I really could think of was just trying to feel better and not die. I was definitely scared that night, but the weed didn't hit me in an emotional way, more of physical way. I was scared because at many points it felt as if my muscles or my chest were sore. Even now after this has all happened, they still kinda do feel that way, albeit not as bad as last night. I also remember my vision was affected by whatever I smoked. At many times while I was lying on the couch, I had an almost strobe-light effect in my vision. This wan't consistent all night, but there were many times when my vision almost looked like it was in stop motion. Finally, my mood was affected by whatever I had, as I was very pushy and overly sexual towards my girlfriend. I remember coming on quite strong to her, then realizing it and feeling really guilty and sorry for how I was acting, and soon after apologizing a bunch of times. This happened a couple of times throughout the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, im still feeing a little hungover. My muscles have an almost laggy feeling to them and my chest is a little sore. I also feel a little hungover from the alcohol I had last night, but I know how that feels compared to this. It's like I've been feeling a little slow or overworked and tired with some weird lagginess and some soreness.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any idea what I smoke last night please help me figure this out. Finally, take this as a lesson to always get your weed from dispensaries or places that you know are safe, as you never know what it could be laced with.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: ok so y'all are saying that the weed wasn't laced. I'm honestly just not sure what laced weed would feel like so I guess this post was just me tryna cover all of my bases. It also doesn't help that I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so when my girlfriend said she thought it was laced, I believed it. I was really paranoid at the time, and looking back on it, it does really just sound like I was super stoned.

Rainbow colors melting and spiraling together, unicorn and smiley faces dancing around each other, bright white lights flashing that diffracted in my altered state. And I was right in front in the middle so it was even more intense. Despite a pretty rowdy crowd I was locked into the visuals and the music. And then the headliner came on. He was delayed but it didn’t matter. Being in front I felt like the whole crowd melted away and it was just him spinning for me. I’m not sure if I was dancing or not but it was fucking gorgeous.

So me and my buddy are hanging out yesterday , driving around to see some people and scored xanax and dilaudid. We each take a bar, we've got pretty high tolerance so it's good. We go out for lunch and then a couple of girls texted me and asked if we wanted to pick them up and go smoke. *weed was on them:) nice suprise* 

So I take another bar and we go get them across town, drive to a small neighborhood under construction in the suburbs, middle of a snow storm and smoked a few bowls each. My friend who was driving proceeds to pull out a hydromorphine 18mg, put it through a pill crusher and do damn near the whole line in one go.  I hadn't seen him doing this until I saw an empty cap of one of the hydros we had just purchased and his face sliding across his phone screen. 

We stay for like fifteen more minutes , I bitched him out for how dumb of a move that was and he insisted that he was fine. He is 19, I am only 17 and the girls with us were both 16. He was the only one with a driver's license. 

He claims he lost his Juul in the restaurant we were eating at, and decided to drive back across town in the storm to attempt at retrieving his juul. After five minutes or so of driving , just getting out of the neighbourhood and towards the highway I notice his eyes barely open, head bobbing slightly from side to side. I started yelling at him to get his shit together or else I was going to have to drive. He says again, I'm fine. At this point the girls in the back are pretty much begging me to take the wheel. As I turn my head back towards my buddy driving,  I notice his hand isn't gripped on the steering wheel and we have an suv coming towards us at probably 80km. I grabbed the wheels and got out of the way just in time to avoid a head on collision. At this point he's barely responding and his foot is still on gas, so I lifted his leg and threw the car into park on the side of the road. Heart slamming against my chest, I escort him out of the drivers seat, put him in passenger and take the wheel. I have a decent amount of driving experience but not even a beginners license. I said fuck it though ; I was in a much better position to drive than him and I had no other choice.

We end up getting to the restaurant just fine , his vape is not there. So he insists we drive to a vape store across town during rush hour to get a new one. Cool, I get into a really busy subdivision of the city, at least fifty cars lined up in each lane. 
After what felt like hours at a red light it finally turned green, I waited for the car ahead of me to get moving and as I let off the brakes they slammed on theirs. I slammed my foot on the brakes and the car slid probably six inches forward , causing the license plate to touch their bumper.

This man comes out of the car screaming with his wife beside him, hitting the window and telling me to get out of the car. I open the door and he begins yelling about the scent of marijuana, I said bud we live in Canada are you fucking retarded as long as I'm not high or smoking in the vehicle I'm good. So he says fair game , let's get insurance and all that. So I search through my unconscious friends glove box for all his information, at this point I'm loosing my cool. I told the girls to grab the bong , weed and whatever they had on them and call a cab so I sauced them $20 and said get out of this ordeal. 

The man clearly sees there is no damage at all and has received all my information. And this point he starts asking about my friend in passenger and why he's so out of it. I said he's just really stoned and I'm DD, he says alright let me see your license. At this point I just said fuck it I don't have one, I'm doing what I think is to a certain extent reasonable and I'll just stay ten toes down on this one. He says he's calling police immediately and I wasn't really fazed, thank God for the xanax. As soon as he arrived though,  he threw a pair of cuffs on me , told me i was under arrest and asked me to wait while he ran a check on the vehicle. Upon returning he asked what my friend was on, I insisted he was just blasted ob edibles and weed. I'm sure he thought it was heroin though , based off how fucked he was. Damn near sleeping in squatting position on the side of the road in a gas station parking lot. I explained how he was in no way fit to drive and license or not I felt it was my responsibility to keep us safe. He was really understanding and uncuffed me, mentioned how many laws we were breaking and how in a different instance this would result in at least three or fours charges but instead he let me off with a $300 ticket. 

They called a tow truck and I remembered about the drugs , I asked if I could grab my smokes and jacket in the car before it got impounded and he just said go get what you need buddy. Got all the drugs out of the car and ended up getting a drive to a new years eve party in a cop car. Because my friend was so high he needed someone to give the officer directions home, he couldn't even say his own fucking street name. But yeah ; good shit all in all. Pretty huge W


Tl;dr  : saved a car full of people from a head on collision with someone because of my friend nodding off behind the wheel. Got arrested ; let go. Let off with a ticket and had a pretty funny car ride with the cop to a party.

1501,Stimulants,My mum asked if she can try 20 mg Ritalin today. Is this idea as bad as I think it is?,"Hi!

So, I take Ritalin because of my ADD, 30mg in the morning and 20 mg after lunch.
Of course I started with a lower dosis, I think it was 5 mg every morning and I remember how ""much"" I felt it the first few days.

So, my mum asked me yesterday if she could take 20 mg of Ritalin today after breakfast. I should maybe add that she only weighs around 10 kilograms more than me so that's not gonna factor so much.

My ""problem"" is that I think 20 mg is too much for her since she never took Ritalin or any Amphetamines before. But since I take 30 and 20 mg I don't have any more 5 mg capsules around... otherwise I would give her a 5 mg dose.

Are my fears justified or would it be ok to give her one in the morning (around 9 a.m. so she will be able to sleep tonight 😂)? 
And what are the effects of taking too a dose of Ritalin that's too high for you? Besides staying up a while if you take it too late?

I told a couple friends and and such and people who pop percs, snort coke, drop acid and do dabs are acting like Ive sold my soul to the depths of addiction. 

I literally have it at home and I’m gonna smoke and go to bed.  


Friends cited symptoms like psychosis and mania and me pulling out my eyes. 

Well guess what.. my Gf and I broke up because I found out she fucked someone else( while I was on meth last night) and I just simply asked her to leave and walked away from her. 

And guess what. I’ve been afraid for my life from Taking a fuckin edible.

1545,Psychedelics,Did I take LSD or something else,"I tested my 125ug tab with a reagent kit so it contains either LSD or one of its analogues, and because of my trip I think it was actually one of its analogues and not LSD. By the way this was my first trip. 

The first notable thing was that I started feeling it after 15 minutes and my understanding is that LSD is supposed to take around 45 minutes to kick in.

The second thing is that after 5 hours I almost completely stopped tripping and I just had a bit of a weird headspace and a tiny bit of visuals. My understanding is that LSD is supposed to last around 12 hours so this was confusing. Then I decided I wanted to reignite my trip by eating a 10mg THC gummy since I remembered reading that weed magnifies your high. After about an hour all the sudden everything flips to slow Mo and I'm tripping mega balls again, much harder than the first time. Then after 2 hours I felt tired and just put my head down and immediately fell asleep.

The third thing was that I was laughing uncontrollably the whole time, and after 2 hours of tripping my chest was feeling very sore so I told myself to not laugh anymore but that didn't work and I continued to laugh at everything for 3 more hours until it wore off, even though it started to get very painful, I felt like it was mandatory to laugh. I've never read that LSD makes you laugh that much, although I have read that it makes you laugh more than usual. 

Also I don't know if this is related but both me and my friend who also took one of my tabs had a really bad stomach ache the next day. 

So yeah because of all that I feel like it wasn't LSD but actually one of its analogues. If anyone agrees or disagrees with me then please let me know. Since this was my first trip I don't know what acid is supposed to feel like, so I have no idea whether these are legitimate concerns or not.

1566,Cannabinoids,Weird Sober-to-High Transition with Weed,"I've had this happen a lot whenever I smoke weed. Not every single time, but the vast majority.

I get really light-headed and dizzy; ringing in my ears as well as getting close to passing out, or even my eyesight going out a bit. 

Why the fuck is that happening and how do I stop it? I really hate it, and it always kind of ruins the giddy mood my friend's are in when I smoke with them. I dunno if it's low blood sugar, but I used to pass out a lot when I was younger because I didn't eat much or stood up too fast.

1663,Cocaine,"Cocaine, New user, Daily use for a month","	I am 18 years old, I am open minded to trying new drugs for the experience. I have had my run with a large assortment of different kinds of drugs.

A little bit of background information to the situation:

	 I have always looked at coke as one of those drugs that I always wanted to try but just put it off because I didn’t think I would like it because I have tried other stimulants like Adderall and Vyvance and did not enjoy my experience with them.
	Personally I have always liked downers such ask Percocet, Roxys, and Xanax, based on that I never did coke just for the idea that I would not enjoy it, just as I did not enjoy the other stimulants I have tried.

	Regardless, I ended up trying it for the first time this summer in July, I did 2 lines total, the first line I did immediately make the whole left side of my face numb, following with the other line making my entire face numb. It made me a lil chatty but I felt antsy and didn’t enjoy the feeling so I didn’t touch it again until about December.
 
	The next time I tried it was when I was offered an 8 ball for a pretty cheap price, at this point I was mentally prepared to try it again. So I went half and half on the ball with a friend. We got home and cut up some lines for ourselves. This time when I did it I felt an intense feeling of euphoria, I felt like I was thinking more rationally and like I could express myself better, I loved it. I loved the way it made me feel and think. 

	Needless to say I began doing it every night when I got home from work, at first it was just me and my friend splitting balls for a week doing rails every night. I was going through an out 1.75 grams in about 4 days, this was for about 2 weeks. After this point my friend who was buying with me wanted a break off of it and I told myself I was going to do the same. The same night I found myself going to get a ball for myself, I couldn’t resist the urge. I have been going through about a gram a night if not more for the last 2 weeks. I have noticed how it is making my nose congested and the occasional nose bleeds, that should have been a sigh from my body that I need to slow down but the urge is too great, I resorted to buying saline spray and Mucinex just so I can continue doing it.  I find myself getting home from work at around 11-12’pm every night just to do lines all night and stay up till 6-9am every day. 

I know I need to stop but I just want to know if anyone has any advice on iff I should slowly ween down or just cold turkey
Also just opinions on my situation

1726,story,I got robbed at gunpoint.,"I'm just a 15 stoner and by no means am I a hardened criminal. I've had my run ins with the law but I'm a fairly good kid.

Ok so it's new year's Eve 2018. Me and my friend have been looking for weed all day. Most of our plugs are out because they sell alot around this time of year. But after awhile I finally get a reply from one of my guys. I make up an excuse and tell my mom I'm going to a friend's house. My friend his mom and her boyfriend pick me up. We get all the money sorted out and we ended up with $50. I then text my guy, let's call him Greg for now. Greg says come to this address but park in the alley behind the house. So at this point I'm a little sketched out. I had a bad feeling in my gut telling me not to go, but I did anyway. We come to this house and we park out front. I walked behind the house to find the alley. Nothing. Just someone's back yard so I decided to text Greg. It turns out I was a street over. So I walk back to the car and tell my friend and his mom I'm gonna run over to the next street real quick. I don't know why I didn't just have them drive me over there.... So I tell Greg I'm on the street and he says to go to the alley and look for a white truck. Im walking down the alley and see white truck parked next to a small grey car. I send him a picture and ask if this is the right place. Greg told me to go up to the window on the side of the house and his brother would give me the weed. Greg couldn't be there cause he was taking his girlfriend out to eat. I see his brother pop his head out the window. He yelled ""hey come here bud"". I walk up to him and he hands me a bag and I hand him the money. As soon as that happens a guy runs around the corner, pulls out a gun and points it at me. He said ""give me the money"". I told him the guy in the window had it. He took the money and told me he wanted the weed too. Then he sprints the other way. The guy in the window says to wait there for a sec. He comes outside and asked if I set him up I asked if he had set me up cause it seemed suspicious that the guy ran around the corner as soon as we made the transaction. I have him walk with me and we go back to my friends car. I tell him I just got robbed and he asks if I was serious. I immediately say ""yeah he ran that way"". Greg's brother who was standing next to me and asked who everyone was and said we weren't leaving till Greg got there. My friends mom's boyfriend Starts screaming about how there adults and he wants the money back and blah blah blah. He asks why I didn't chase the guy. I explained he had a gun. I got in the car and Gregs brother started saying your not leaving till my brother gets here. We left anyway and I'm pretty sure I was set up at this point. Greg was blowing up my phone telling me to go back and stay there. He was getting annoying and I was still kinda in shock. Also Greg is kind of a scary dude. I just blocked him. My friends mom just dropped me off at my house. I told my mom they went to a new year's Eve party. I then tell her I'm gonna go to my other friends. He lived a block away from my house so I just walked over. He let me in and I explained what happened. He also thinks I was set up. Then I got a text that probably saved my life. It was from my lifelong best friend. He had originally introduced me to Greg and he told me first to unblock Greg and explain what happened. Second he told me that a guy we know texted him asking if he knew any plugs he could rob. After doing some research on Facebook I found a picture of the guy who texted my friend standing with the guy who robbed me. I text Greg and explained everything then told him about the guy who texted my friend. He was pissed cause his little brother got robbed and he wanted his money. At this point I just want to be done with this. So I go back to my house and ask my mom if I can go get my girlfriend whose on the other side of town. It's like a 20 min drive but she let me even though it was snowing pretty heavily. She and I went to a new year's Eve party and I just turned off my phone. I was trying to have fun and act normal but she knew something was off. About halfway through the party she asked what was wrong. I tell her everything that happened and I didn't want her to worry. After that we talked for a bit and after midnight we left the party and she went with her friend and I went and got some 4 lokos from the 24 hour gas station. I went home cracked one open and played some video games. Everything after that is a blur.

I woke up super hungover. I had pretty bad dry mouth so I got a soda chugged it then face planted into the couch in the living room. I woke back up 3 hours later and checked my phone. I texted my girlfriend and a couple people who  slid up on my Snapchat story. Greg texted me but he was calm now. He told me he still wanted his money. I only had $20. We made a deal since he owed me 3 grams. I couldn't find a ride to him so I chugged a 4 loko and went to my friends house who lived a block away. We played some cod ghosts which was quite fun being drunk. Greg said he'd come to me and be on his way soon, so I said to meet up at the Subway in my part of town. My other friend met me there just cause I didn't wanna go alone. I explained what's going on to my friend while I waited for Greg. Greg pulls up and I go outside and give him the money. I explained my side of the story and told him about the guy who texted my one friend again. He asked if we were cool and I said yeah and fist bumped him. I went inside and me and my friend went to his place. about a 5 min walk. We take a bunch of alcohol out of his fridge and since I don't have a real winter coat, I wear like 5 sweatshirts. I fill every pocket up at least 2 beers in each pocket. I quickly run outside and he tells his mom we were gonna go walk around. We go to a park nearby and start drinking. He's super light weight when it comes to drinking. Especially for a big dude. So I ended up drinking most of it. After that we go our separate ways and I walked home. When I got home I quickly went in my room and changed and put a piece of gum in my mouth. My stepdad told me dinner was ready but I told him I already ate. I called my girlfriend and accidentally fell asleep on the phone. That leads up to now. I haven't heard anything from Greg yet.

1750,Psychedelics,130ug first time LSD trip report,"I'm just finishing my comedown and gonna cut straight to the story. I took the tab with 3 close friends, one dosed with me.

40 minutes - The come up is just starting and I listen to music with a jumper over my eyes. I have a strong body high and neck tingles at this point

1 hour - I'm starting to trip and feel somewhat uncomfortable, so we go outside. I walked around the garden with my bare feet while thinking about how awesome it is, but also thinking that that's just what I want myself to think because of how people love nature on acid.

1.5 hours At this point I feel like everything's rotating and heavy, I can smell sweat and feel all my body, especially my stomach. My taste is just confused, my vision is changed by all these moving patterns and lights on anything I focus on, a painting becomes outstandingly bright and almost 3D. Everything is in a constant state of change. I keep thinking I wet myself because I can't tell how pants feel, and everything smells musty, kind of like sweat. Everything I touch is fascinating and new, a half inflated ball implodes in my hands and I feel enveloped by it.

2 hours - The effects have gotten stronger, I think I hit ego death. I kept asking my friends questions about myself, trying to piece together who I was. I felt somewhat torn and immensely scared and uncomfortable, I wanted the time to go by. At the time I knew I should let go, and was trying, but didn't understand how. I still don't understand how to change this trip to make it enjoyable. The nausea and feeling of stomach also continues. I texted my friend in the same room to be amazed by communication, I knew my age and their ages but couldn't understand the differences, everything seemed alien and foreign.

4 hours - I start to come down from this weird state of confusing and not knowing anything. We start playing cards and I eventually can follow the game, although cards disappear and appear out of my hand without me noticing, just touching the cards feels incredible. I start trying to piece back together how I should act and find myself very empathetic and insightful, which doesn't sit well with some of the group, I have things to think about from this moment.

5/7 hours - I have mild tracers, colors are bright, things reverberate. The visuals were clearly not the point of the trip though, they're something that comes with it. I come to a realization that psychedelics act on our 'sixth sense', inner vision or consciousness, that other drugs don't touch. This also stimulate our visuals as part of this vision. Not sure how much I agree with it now, but I think there's something to be said about how our consciousness is untouchable, precious and unique. Listening to my friends conversations, I feel like I understand the social dynamic between all of them and know how to fix all their problems. Except I can't get it out of my mind, I'm over analyzing everything but I understand it all. I have some great discussions about general life and I realize how awesome other people are and the value of being kind to other people.

8-12 hours(current time) - I've been at home with my parents, but have somewhat gone back to my normal routine, and feel sad about that in a way? As if it should be changed and the acid should prompt it. The main things I took from it currently were a need for a deep emotional connection with someone, which I don't have at the moment but have been wanting for a while anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Maybe I'm still tripping now a little, I think I need to sleep and try to remember everything. I feel a loss for some of the experience I had, as I can't bring it back but I know there's positive in there somewhere. I'm exhausted so maybe I'll see tomorrow, just passing the time and feeling eh about doing things to pass the time as I usually do. But then again, how else do you pass the time?

After the second day of sniffing rails I started to feel like shit. I didn't like the crash so I stopped. The day after a friend had some molly. I wasn't sure how much I took but it was a heavy dose. My friend put (I think) .5-1 grams of molly in a water bottle and we both drank it. About 30 mins pass and I am rolling tits on the  moon. After a night of partying I eventually fall asleep. I wake up the next morning  feeling lethargic and just overall low energy. Later that night I have 4 beers and I eventually pass out on the couch. For the last 3-4 days I probably had collectively 15 hours of sleep and did not eat enough. I wake up in a panic and having to pee. I feel my heart racing, started to get tunnel vision, began to feel like I couldn't breathe, limbs were numb, and I felt like I was having a heart attack. I kept saying, ""I feel like I'm dying"". My friend rushed over to calm me down. He told me I was having a panic attack and he calmed me down by telling me to breathe slowly. He had also dealt with severe anxiety so he recognized the symptoms. I eventually pull myself together but tears began to flow down my eyes. I cried for a few minutes and went back to bed. I had never experienced a panic attack on this level. I was convinced I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die. Was this a mix of drugs that caused the panic attack? Or lack of sleep and nutrition? Or the combination of all of this? ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abs9w8/panic_attack_during_molly_crash/
1756,Cannabinoids,Adult swim and Off The Air,"I was very high after about 5 bong hits a couple nights ago, laying in bed enjoying my nice body and head high. I always watch Adult Swim at night and saw some really cool intriguing videos. What I am referencing is the Off The Air  Winter episode https://youtu.be/u43VXCNzVsY . And it was so crazy with the slow subtle changes and it really was cool if anyone is high and wants something good to watch I would recommend it.

1760,Diazepam,Life changing 3 tabs+Tapentadol+Valium+O-PCE trip report (real psychonaut shit!),"On September 11th 2018, I took 3 tabs of LSD with a buddy of mine. During the come up we just sat down and watched parks and recreation. Around 50 minutes in I looked at my hands and I noticed that they looked a little wonky. I did not mind. Once it had become clear to both of us that we were high as fuckkkk, the friend decided to put on some tunes. The music selected was Travis Scott's ""Astroworld."" I thought it sounded sick as fuck until the song ""No Bystanders"" came on. The people yelling ""Fuck the club up!"" sounded scary and I got spooked. I relayed this information to my friend and he changed the music. Then we started listening to some chill shit and all was calm until the song ""My old man"" by Mac DeMarco came on. That song made me feel real weird, so I told my frien to change the song. That's when things got really fucking lit!!! My friend started to not really like tripping at that and had started freaking out a lil bit. In my LSD confusion I had contemplated offering a blow job (im bisexual lol) in order to alleviate his bad trip. Upon further analysis I had decided not to do that. Who knows how differently this trip could have gone if I had done that. In my panic I had decided to take 3 Tapentadols (an opioid with some dissociative effects) in order to make me feel good. My friend had taken some antipsychotics so he could fall asleep. Instead of making me feel good, my trip just got really fucking weird. It felt like every pore of my body was about spill gallons of cum. It was kind of fuckin lit but I was also really scared (I'm a pussy lol). I wandered around in this enlightened state for about an hour trying not to cum until another buddy of mine came over to help me through this challenging psychonautic journey. It had become clear to him that I was not having a good trip so he had decided to give a xanax that was actually valium pressed with O-PCE (unknowingly to him). It was at that point that I had reached complete ego death. I was ducking in and out of consciousness for about an hour. All I remember is crying talking over the phone to a lady friend of mine. My visuals got very intense and I could barely see a fucking thing. Everything was neon and when I walked I felt like I was going a billion miles per hour. It was at that point I realized that mother nature is God and that God loves me. And since I'm a part of mother nature, I am a part of God. After crying I passed the hell out on the bed like a baller. I eventually woke up about 6 hours later, extremely inebriated. I got a text from my pops asking about where I was. I immediately stumbled out to my car and decided to drive home. I accidentally scratched a truck, thus having the cops called on me. I get pulled over, and the cops decided I was fucked up (fuck 12!). In my LSD+Tapentadol+Valium+O-PCE state of mind they decide to arrest me, even though I am God at this point in being. After they release my caucasian ass, I take a taxi to my former high school cuz fuck it lol. I then get picked up by my dad because the high school kicked me out. I then tried to commit suicide because I was still pretty fucked up and I thought that a DUI meant my life was over. I ended up in the hospital for a week. 

All in all a really great trip, I learned a lot about myself, and the afterglow was solid as my dick was while I wrote this.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/absdhm/life_changing_3_tabstapentadolvaliumopce_trip/
1767,Psychedelics,Had an actual LSD flashback on new years.,"So what I did I was extremely drunk over New year's and ripped some lines of amphetamine to get a bit clearer again, didn't sleep the whole night, then passed out at 8 in the morning on a couch when the speed started wearing off. 

Woke up 3 hours later, ate some oranges and went to wait for my train back home. That's when I realized that I could see the typical acid patterns on the concrete floor and that I was hearing everything way louder. The 20 minutes I waited felt like an hour. I was actually scared af because it's been like 4 months that I last took acid and I knew that nobody could have dosed me when I was sleeping (wouldn't fit with the timing). So I'm assuming it was some kind of HPPD??

I slept for like 12 hours after that and now I'm kinda feeling better but still have that tingling chest feeling I always have on acid.

1857,Opioids,Am I immune to codeine,"I have taken codeine pills on 2 or 3 occasions. I've taken from brands like Tylex, Kapake. All pills were 500mg/30mg of paracetamol/codeine phosphate. The first time was 180mg of codeine phosphate (I know taking 3000mg of paracetamol is dangerous but I didn't have the supplies to do a CWE.) At the dose of 180mg I felt nothing... At the start I got some placebo effect of heaviness but then nothing.

The second time I took 240mg of codeine phosphate. Again I know 4000mg of paracetamol is dangerous but I don't do it frequently. This time I felt a stronger placebo effect and then again after 40 minutes it was gone.

I know they were real codeine as they were prescribed to my father when he broke his femur 3 years ago and he no longer needed them. I found them recently but have not felt any sort of effect from them. I don't know if there's something wrong with me or if it's common not to feel any effects.

2058,Psychedelics,Intense auditory hallucinations from 2g dried mushrooms,"So about 6 months ago I had found a reliable shroom dealer for the first time and I was going “sicko mode”.  I was probably tripping close to once a week and became pretty familiar with this headspace now I have about 13 mushroom trips total ranging from .5g to 5.5g. Now onto the story

My friend had picked up a quarter ounce of some good mushrooms, he ate an 8th and reported to seeing faces all over his bedroom. I asked to buy 2g and he obliged selling them to me during lunch. The trip took place on a Wednesday and my plan was to sneak out of the house meet my friend and trip out.

The trip: I ate the whole two grams  around 10:30p when my parents were still awake and strategically exited my back door and hopped over my fence to meet my friend. I arrived at this park in between both of our houses and we shared a gram and half rolled into a backwoods. 

The first visuals I remember having were seeing the trees dancing. I would stare off into the distance for elongated periods of time without really saying anything. At one point I was laying on the ground because of the heavy body load and I looked up at my friend’s face. What I saw was what appeared to be metallic gold paint all across his face and then it turned into the moon emoji. So we’re sitting down and move to another park a short distance away and we talk for a few hours just on anything that came to mind. Ex: becoming a celebrity, how easy it would be to become famous just stuff like that. Eventually it was like 1a and I left worried that I would be caught for sneaking out.

This is where things got intense....

I was walking home alone and it looked like my body was a light up sign on Vegas. It was like whatever I thought was visually projected in front of me In bright colours. For example I would be thinking of something positive and if I thought of something negative I would see a bunch of flashing lights and sirens and I would hear the word “bad” repeated over and over again.

I somehow managed to get home and I was sitting in my upstairs washroom tripping balls. Everything was alive, I looked down at my legs and they were changing colours in front of me. I looked up at my shower wall and saw a  hieroglyphic eye.

At this point it was about 2a and I went back in my room. I was in bed and I heard the laughter of children. Normally this would be terrifying but I was so confused that it wasn’t for some reason. I remember until I fell asleep I thought my alarm clock was on because I kept hearing voices in my room. That was all I can remember before I fell asleep

Moral: shrooms are deceiving. I did not think I would trip that hard nor did I think I would get auditory hallucinations

2063,Psychedelics,My first LSD experience a year ago!,"
Cross post from r/Thighsexual and posted a year ago;

I'm still tripping a little bit BUT I just had the most amazing adventure! It would be truly a misdeed of me if I had not informed my compardres of my grand experience!

See, my old doctor, Dr. Carlson got fired, and he's now a bum living off the street. But, good old Carlson offered me some good shit last Friday and he was giving me the willies so I ended up taking his entire stash so he could have my broken off-white leather Ikea office swivel chair that I so unfortunately broke while masturbating to pictures of Bill Gates! Oh what a handsome devil!

I decided to take it, and twenty minutes later I felt like nothing was happening. I felt so depressed, and alone. In a dark pit in my soul...I went to bed and suddenly I felt something warm moving towards me.

It was a nerd! A naked one, in all of his skinny, pale, completely hairless, creamy glory!

I gasped in awe, when I felt a hand push itself against my mouth and nose, his nails digging into my tender flesh. He whispered into my ear, his horn-rimmed glasses being barely visible in my peripheral, ''don't force it dear, just let it happen...''

That was when I knew he was in full authority of me. Nobody revolts against a nerd and gets away with it, I thought. He gave me a pair of handcuffs and that's when I handcuffed my own hands using my newfound telekinetic powers!

He pushed my forward and began stroking my neck and back, while commenting how smooth and ''oh so delicate'' my neck really was. I was having an epiphany in my darkest hours, and my most colorful of dreams! Yes! It was God in nerd form!

I felt his firm, yet somewhat soft thighs begin to crush my neck as I could do literally nothing to stop it. His telekinetic powers overpowered my feeble ones... tighter and tighter! His thighs blackened my neck as I screamed out in both pain and orgasm.. blood shot out of my mouth as my trachea was shattered, forcing itself out from my pursed lips and leaving reddened splotches on my bedsheets and towards his feet. Not that it bothered him, this was how he gained power!

I gasped and gasped. It was no use! I desperately writhed as asphyxiation progressed, but found that I was being drowned by the nerd's cum that was churning out like a faucet, no! A waterfall! An impossibly continuous waterfall of nerd cum mockingly masked my purple-tinted face in a white, sticky, ever so gooey hodgepodge of delicious, nerdlet cream of only the utmost finest quality!

It wasn't until long that I found myself floating...in a world where every living person is a nerd or a nerd's thigh walking on it's own legs! Legs of lamb, chicken thighs, and a nerd who ruled them all! That's when I heard yelling... oh the yelling! It was murder for my ears!

It was my alarm! In my bewildered state, I had drunkenly come upon the realization that I'd been tripping out for a good 7 hours and my bedsheets were stained with gratuitous amounts of cum, vomit AND I pissed and shit all over my laptop.

And let me tell you it was completely fucking worth it. 10/10 will consult Dr. Carlson again! Now to clean all the cum, shit, piss and vomit all over my room... I am a new man!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abwrh5/my_first_lsd_experience_a_year_ago/

2156,Psychedelics,My first and probably last candyflip ! My experience," 

\*this is my new throwawayaccount\*

\--about myself--

I'm a 25 year old male from Belgium who started experiencing with drugs 3-4 years ago.

\- -My experience with drugs --

I've done around 10 times mdma (couple at home, rest at festivals)

5 times shrooms

1x lsd

and some 'keys' of ketamine

so I would say I still feel myself as a newbie when it comes to drugs

\--Why candyflipping?--  
I've read about candyflipping that it would be sort of amazing. And I couldn't wait to do it. And when I read stories about it I got hyped to try it out.

\--the location--

awakenings festival amsterdam

\--at the festival--

the story :)

Me and some friends set up our tents at a camping near the festival.  
And we immediatly notice a lot of youth! super awesome.  
Even some friendly neighbours started helping setting up our tents (which become awesome friends later :D )

We immediatly all start talking about the festival and we said were about to take some drugs ;).  
They were super chill and they said they were about to take something too.

We took a cab to the festival around lunch. When we arrived we notice some cops and we all get a bit uncomfy.  
So we agree we to take our tab already. (100 micrograms each) and we would take our pills (120mg) 4-5 hours later.

Once we arrive we notice the security is super strict! luckily our pills were near our crotches so we didn't get caught.  
But got asked a lot of question why we have so much glowsticks/vicks inhalers/lollipops while we still have that tab beneath out tongue. One of my friends even swallowed his tab. after an hour we can clearly feel the lsd. but we didn't expect it would cause so much distraction and confusion. We started walking around the festival but everything felt so slow. waiting for vouchers, drinks , ...

It was super hot that day so we were all a bit scared we would get dehydrated so we started drinking lots of water which resulted in lots of trips to the toilet. But damn that was scary , because there was so much people there we lost eachother each 5 minutes. it was so messy and stressy I couldn't enjoy the beauty of the festival itself. because the festival felt like a maze but it was afterwards pretty easy to manage around.  
What opened my eyes was how everyone on the festival looked like they took something and everyone was super chill and friendly!

4 hours later and we still haven't seen a dj because we had no idea where we were. Suddenly our friends from the camping messaged us they were going to see Kölsch which is also one of our favorites. We messaged them we would come but couldn't manage our way around so they came to pick us up and we told them we took LSD.

About an hour later my friend decide to take their pill , I refuse because the lsd is still working hard on me.  
An hour later I decide to drop too.

\*1hour later\*  
BOOM it kicks in. HARD.  
Time flies..  
Were listening to richie hawtin and suddenly a feeling arises...  
I'm gay  
I try to disprove it,

no , I'm bisexual ..

I can't make my mind and start sort of panicking.  
I tell my friend I'm gay.  
They were so fucking supportive it even made me realise afterwards how beautifull it was to have such friends.  
but i'm still thinking about how I feel..  
So I even tell how I feel to my new friends from the camping

When someone asks : do you like girls? I answer yes..  
Do you like boys? I answer no.  
She says : then your not gay.  
and my panicking is over. It was such an easy answer I couldn't find myself.

The day after.. I wake up and realise what a weird and uncomfy feeling it gave me.  
They asked how do you feel (with some laughter).

So I make clear it was the combination of those two love drugs that made me love everything at that moment.  
but it has brought some confusion with me over the next months. Do I ONLY like girls, do I like boys? why was I thinking that I liked boys. Am I bi?

Even months later I still don't know the answer but has accepted that there is maybe some gayness in me :)

Months later we meet again with my new friends from the camping and start bringing up those stories from awakenings! everyone super chill, we all laugh about what we did at the festival and even about my story.

If I need to kill this trip, I don’t have any benzos on hand. I have 1 50mg trazadone, 1 25mg hydroxyzine (antihistamine) and a few 800mg skelaxin.

I can’t find many reports of interactions on these with LSD, other than it might dull the trip. I don’t think I want to take all of them if anything goes awry, what would be my best option?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abxws0/killing_an_lsd_trip_help_needed/

2210,Cannabis,My first bad trip on weed? I’m kind of worried there was something else in there other than marijuana.,"I had the worst trip last night. Since marijuana is a memory loss drug. I will try to recount the night as best as I can. Keep in mind that it’s hard for me to describe things like this because I don’t have much to base it off.

For some background, I’m a seventeen year old kid who’s growing up in a religious Mormon household. Lately I’ve been seriously questioning the Mormon church and it’s teachings.

I finished smoking a bowl and decided to sit down and watch some YouTube. My favorite thing to watch while high is Vsauce so I turned on one of his videos about Deja Vu. I remember being excited because since I was high this video about Deja Vu was going to actually give me Deja Vu. Then my mind sort of went numb. I don’t remember much else other than all of a sudden for no reason whatsoever I was continuously being reminded that Deja Vu is a glitch in the matrix.

Then it hit. The only way I can describe what happened is if you turn up the bass super high in your car and listen to a song. It felt like a complete and total sensory overload throughout my entire body. I kind of liked it at first but then it kept happening and I had this powerful thought that this was indeed the matrix and nothing was real. This is when it started to scare me. I had that same feeling over and over again. I knew that I was starting to have a bad trip so I changed the video and decided to watch something else to get my mind off of Deja Vu and the afterlife.

It only got worse from there. I got really scared and wanted nothing more than to come down. I knew I wasn’t in my right mind and that this would all pass with time. This proved to be comforting throughout the night. Since I wanted to sober up a little I got up and drank a bunch of water. The water only helped so much, I would forget about my sudden realization that everything was fake and I’d start to calm down. Then I’d remember why I needed to calm myself down and it hurtled me back into knowing that everything around me was fake and I was most definitely in the matrix.

At this point, my heart rate was super fast and I was absolutely terrified. I decided to just go to bed because I knew somehow that this would all be gone in the morning. I laid down and told myself to go to sleep.

Throughout the next thirty or so minutes I would sit up and tell myself that everything was real and that you just kind of scared yourself. I kept telling myself over and over again that this was reality and that I had nothing to be scared about. Then it got worse. I got cold and really scared. I wanted to go tell my mom and dad what I did so that they could comfort me. I wanted to go lay down with my siblings and fall asleep snuggling with them. I just needed someone to help me. I felt splinched in between two realities. I had the desire to go throughout the entire world to make sure it was all still there. I kept repeating to myself in an almost trance-like way that I needed to stay in my room.

“Stay in your room TickNut, TickNut, stay in your room. You know this is okay TickNut. You know this is real and you know you need to stay in your room. It’s okay TickNut.”

I remembered that I could change this and I could come off of a bad trip if I changed my setting. So I went down to the kitchen to get me some food. I wasn’t in the mood to eat but I remembered that eating is a common thing when you’re high and it might help the derealization that I was having.

Something about having to be quiet and not waking everyone up helped bring me back to reality. As I was making corn dogs my little sister woke up and asked me what I was doing. I told her to come watch some tv with me because I needed the company. I showed her my Minecraft world and we watched some videos and I started to come down and I started to feel safe and okay again. I thought I’d beat the bad trip and I was going to be fine.

After a while, my sister decided to go to bed and I was left alone again. I laid down and tried to fall asleep. I started to come off the high and I told myself that I took something weird and I’d be okay in the morning. That’s when it got worse, so so much worse. I jolted up and I had finally come to the realization that I had indeed died. It made so much sense now, the weed I took was laced and I overdosed on something weird. I died and this was the afterlife. I was so completely and utterly terrified. I got up to look for my body. I believed that I had died and that I was a spirit disconnected from my body. I got up and looked throughout my house to find my body but I couldn’t ever find it. I went to lay down again and all of a sudden the realization changed slightly. I still overdosed and died, that part was all the same. But instead of being in the spirit world or afterlife I had just been transported to a parallel universe. A world almost infinitely similar to the original universe. But with one thing changed. TickNut never died in this universe. So here I was, alive but also dead. I started to think about all my loved ones I left behind, I thought the afterlife would be different. I thought I’d be able to see my funeral and spectate what happens to my body. But of course, this wasn’t the case. I’d never be able to see my old universe again. I had died in that one and could never go back. I kept telling myself that either I was just really high and having a bad trip or I had actually died and been sent to a parallel universe where everything felt very slightly different. I told myself to go to bed and when I woke up one of these things would be true and it was okay if I had died because I was in a universe that was basically the same already. I made peace with death and the unknown that night.

I woke up again and the high was gone, that awful terrible feeling was gone. I could only remember it vaguely. It had lasted all but two hours but it felt like an eternity. The bad trip did teach me some things though. If it was a bad trio after all.

Edit: Figured I’d better add a TL;DR

I smoked a bowl of marijuana last night and had this super intense derealization feeling that I had died and was experiencing the afterlife. I believed that I had overdosed and then was sent to an alternate universe where I could continue on living. I think it was a bad trip but I’m sort of worried I got something in there other than weed and I actually did die.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/abylvf/my_first_bad_trip_on_weed_im_kind_of_worried/

2284,Psychedelics,My therapy session with Shadow People,"(Sorry about any formatting issues, writing this on mobile)

So, to start this story, here’s some context: this was my second time doing Mushrooms. The first time, I had taken 4 on a half-full stomach, and had a decent trip that quickly turned bad. Managed to live though. So now, a year later, I’m finally in possession of more. 5 grams of dried golden caps. I had recently gone through quite a bit in life, a bad breakup and toxic relationship, some deaths in the family, and I really wanted to look inwards. A mix of self-reflection, and getting absolutely fucked.

Anyway, I follow Terrence McKenna’s mantra by taking five dried grams in silent darkness, and on an empty stomach. At first nothing is crazy, it’s about 1am, and I’m laying in bed staring into the darkness of the ceiling. My heart starts racing suddenly, and I enter the mushroom phase that many of you may know about: “Oh no, I’m dying!”. Knowing well that this was just a part of it, I take it fine.

Now, this is where shit changes up. In the corner of my bedroom, I notice a tall shadow being standing silently, watching. Little body definition, and no clear face. He was standing with a spear, and he seemed to be guarding another shadow figure. This one stood tall, had a large neck, and a larger head. A little more of a defined body shape than the guard. This was my first time hallucinating entities while tripping, so it was quite a bit of shock. I couldn’t tell if they were friend or foe, so I laid perfectly still for around 5 minutes before moving.

I wondered why they were so silent, until it hit me; they weren’t. I had been hearing them inside my head, as if they were my thoughts. Realizing this, I start to converse with them in my head. We share exchanges telepathically, and it’s amazing. We discuss all the things that had happened that year, what is to come, and my place in all of it. It felt nice being able to be completely transparent with someone, even if those people were made out of shadows, in my head. They give me the closure I had been seeking for months, and for the first time in a long time, I felt genuine happiness. I drew a very rough, tripped out sketch of the two so I could remember them, and they eventually went on their way when their work was done.

After their departure, I had a fairly regular remainder of a trip, and a smooth come down. Since then, I haven’t felt as held back about the sadness of my past, and now, especially in the new year, I look forward to the new, happier memories I can make and look back on. I’ll be taking some shrooms tomorrow, and maybe I’ll see my shadow friends again. And we can discuss the wonders of life once more.

TL:DR: Got fucked on 5 dried grams of shrooms, locked myself in my dark room for the night, and hallucinated shadow people. We talked in my mind, they had access to my thoughts, and helped me to overcome sadness and grief. 10/10, would recommend to a friend.

suddenly I get these full body sensations that just kinda vibrate through me. then my vision gets wavy and I kinda start to panic thinking about all the times i’ve read about acid flashbacks making people never smoke again cause of how intense it is. 

at this point i’m feeling these strong body vibrations, my body feels hot and my visions just fucked. everything just overwhelming and i’m trying to tell myself i’m just stupid high and causing it.

I start watching goon cause it’s one of my favorite movies and just texting my friend. I still have all these intense sensations for about three more minutes then it starts to subside. 

I do have anxiety so i started to think i could’ve self induced a panic attacks for some weird reason. I guess I came here to ask that if you have an acid flashback does it last long? or is it something you just experience for a couple minutes?

2501,Psychedelics,One Year Tripaversary!,"Hello friends. I want to start off by saying Happy New Year! Hopefully everyone’s year is filled with love, peace, and happiness. I’ve been an avid reader on this subreddit for quite awhile now. I posted in here once about my first LSD trip, which is why I’m making this post in the first place. A year ago today, right around this time actually, my mind was a fuzzy mess as I prepared myself for an experience I’d never forget. 

Since I’ve already posted the full trip report, here is a link to it for those who may want to read it. It’s pretty lengthy and maybe a mess since I typed it up the day after so sorry in advance. [Trip Report](https://reddit.app.link/dSyipQGnaT)

I just want to take a second to say what a year it’s been since taking psychedelics for the first time. I’ve grown to be such a more down to earth human and I couldn’t be happier about that! I’ve came across some pretty low valleys over the course of this year but they’ve only made me appreciate the peaks I’ve reached even more. 

I’ve always struggled with managing my depression and some anxiety issues since I was 12-13 (22 now) and honestly, after taking LSD for the first time it’s managed to really help me be able to control my mental health issues more. I’ve genuinely felt more happy and felt like I have such a better understanding of my mind and how it works and why it does what it does. Which, in return, has helped me be able to break down why I feel like I do and be able to work on turning my mood around. 

I won’t blabber on too much more but I mainly wanted to make this post as a way to say thank you. Thank you guys for continually sharing your experiences.

We sat there for an hour at the very least and she still was having a horrible time, she explained it to be very tweaky and all the negative side effects without the rolling feeling.

2573,Stimulants,Ritalin Side Effects?,"I need some advice. Or at least some sort of validation that I’m not crazy? I don’t even know. 

I was diagnosed with ADD when I was a kid, took meds for it all throughout grade school and high school and then eventually quit taking it. I felt like my ability to focus without them had improved and I had grown out of it. Went through a few different jobs over the last 6 years, no issues focusing, still didn’t feel that I needed them.

But let’s be honest, even if you aren’t prescribed, there’s nothing quite like being able to pop an adderall and clean your house like you’ve been saying you would all week, or just starting a project you’ve been wanting to do and powering through till it’s complete because you have so much energy! So every now and then (once maybe every other month) I dabbled. Pop an addy at 9pm on a Saturday night because you want to stay out and drink for a friends birthday. Pop an addy because even though you don’t feel like it, you’re room has been trashed for a week and you finally have the time to reeaally clean it.

Fast forward again, still not taking it on a regular basis. I ask my cousin if I can have a couple of her Ritalin because I’m up late hanging out with her and some family and I know work will be hell tomorrow if Im exhausted and can’t focus. My cousin gives me a bunch of Ritalin, 54’s.  And I mean a bunch, she probably gave me 30 pills. The next morning before work I took the first one and I noticed that I was 10,000x more focused. I was doing better at work, staying super organized, felt super determined, it was great. It made me feel so much more productive that I started taking them every morning before work and I continued being laser focused and on top of my game.

A few weeks went by and I’ve continued to take them every morning during the work week. But the past week now, I’ve started feeling completely different. At work I can’t focus at all, I find myself checking the clock every 5 minutes praying for the end of the day. The second I get home I feel completely emotionless and depressed. I never have suicidal thoughts, I’m just completely uninterested in anything and anyone. I can barely eat, the thought of food makes me nauseous. I stay up until 3am when I used to be asleep by 10 every night. Are these Ritalin side effects?

I’m not gonna take one tomorrow before work and see how I feel.. if anyone else can relate to this please let me know I’m not crazy. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ac2a1x/ritalin_side_effects/
2637,Cannabinoids,weed makes me act like I'm on a mix of meth and acid and doctors don't know why,"I have been a stoner on and off for a couple of years. It used to affect me normally, even after I started a few different medications that could potentially interact negatively with it. For a while last year I would smoke every day and I had such a tolerance that I could keep up with my friends who had been lifelong stoners.

Then one day alone in my room I sucked half of my dab pen in one sitting and I experienced the first of what's been happening to me since. 

I had sharp pain like the feeling of being stabbed with a rusty shank. Worse then a broken leg. Worse then the worst stomach cramp of my life. For hours I was on the floor convulsing with pain. I had vivid visions of being tortured which was strange because up until that point I was never a visual thinker, even while high. 

After that I stayed away from everything for around six months and a month ago I tried smoking again. Half a joint and the same thing happened except worse. Along with the pain I had physical convulsions. My face and head twitched, (can't blame it on cannabis shakes it because it was far more extreme and lasted longer), and I had insane visual and auditorial hallucinations. Felt like I was in a new dimension every split second. It felt distinctly like my neurons were firing all at once in random patterns. I had detailed trippie ego death type conclusions about things (according to my friends who heard me talk in that state)  

Kept smoking just a couple hits each time, and I was able to manage it, prickling instead of stabbing, red dots instead of crippling hallucinations. No twitching.

The turning point was a few days ago. I was with a guy I was dating and the twitching was so bad that he broke up with me the next day because he was convinced I was on meth or crack. The pain was so bad, in my head, like my brain was being dragged across broken glass...

He, like so many I've talked to, has been around weed all his life and seen plenty of bad reactions but none manifesting in this way. He left me alone at my apartment early on in the night and I ended up calling 911. I went to the emergency room and they were absolutely baffled, didn't believe that I was just on weed, and had never seen anything like this before. They also said it WAS NOT a seizure. They gave me a benzo to make me stop flailing and twitching and released me the next day with a diagnosis of marijuana intoxificatoon. 
I emailed the UCSD marijuana research lab with the subject line ""I am a data anomaly"" and they're answer was basically ""Dear Mr. Marks, boi u right you are a data anomaly we have no idea we've never heard of that before.""

My only plausible thoery is maybe the meds I was on for a bit screwed with my brains ability to process weed, but I've researched that and it seems unlikely for many reasons so I don't want to bother even putting the details on here. 

My question to you guys is, has anyone had physical pain or twitching/convulsions caused by marijuana before?

2704,LSD,"Weird thing about psychedelics - took some bunk acid on New Year's, had a surprising and interesting experience.","Pretty cross faded rn


My boyfriend and I bought some tabs to drop on new years eve. He tripped intensely but my tab was less than satisfactory. I tripped for all of about three hours. 

But the funny thing about psychedelics is: I always learn something. 

Every time I trip, no matter how mild or moderate, I always come out with some interesting insight or some kind of new emotion I never felt before. 

Now when I smoke weed it feels psychedelic, similar to how it felt when I first started. Whenever I trip, I get this weird feeling. I can only describe it as being out on the beach, on an island in the ocean, pure sunlight and blue sky, no clouds. You know that like, surreal ethereal feeling you get when you're in an environment like that. Like when you were a kid and you went to the water park and the cute girl in the red bikini smiled at you and all your friends are with you and life just feels, so hopeful. So exciting. So innocent. 

It's sad, really. But what you learn from those experiences is important. Social skills, attachment, getting along with others. Same with tripping. And it'll take awhile for me to integrate this experience but the feeling certainly lasted.

2723,5-HO-DMT,Yopo trip report - A failed trip,"Well, guys, I have finally tried Yopo. And it's entirely possible that I just did it wrong, but whatever the case, I did not trip on it.

I followed the advice of other Redditors and after checking some trip reports on Erowid, I took 8 Yopo seeds (var. Peregrina) and put them in a frying pan, on low heat, until they popped. Then I removed the shell and put them in a mortar and pestle, and ground them up.  
[Swelling seeds in pan](https://i.imgur.com/LghUr8I.jpg)  
[Seed with shell removed ](https://i.imgur.com/RNRQIiT.jpg)  
After this, I put the ground up seeds in my bong, and smoked them. I took around 10-12 good puffs, because my bong has a pretty small bowl so I needed more puffs. Anyway, after taking the puffs, I noticed that the smoke was not at all foul-tasting or smelling, as many people have claimed. And it did not smell like peanut butter either, another seemingly common observation.  
[Seeds in bong](https://i.imgur.com/9uaMLJx.jpg)  
(The above picture shows only some of the ground seeds in the bong, because I could not fit the rest, but I added more later and smoked those too.) 

So after taking the initial few hits, my muscles felt really sore, for some reason. I put down the bong and walked around, I still felt normal. So I took a couple more hits, as I said, 10-12 altogether. Muscles still felt sore but I felt absolutely no nausea, which is another thing that people said, they all felt nauseous and vomited after smoking the seeds.

Now, I felt a bit relaxed and tired after smoking the seeds, but that could all be placebo. I didn't feel out of the ordinary besides having sore muscles, which could just be the result of working out which I do every day, but I doubt it's that, because my muscles only started feeling sore after smoking the Yopo seeds.

And yes, these are genuine Peregrina seeds, some say they are the weaker of the two varieties (Peregrina and Columbrina) but people have successfully tripped on the Peregrina variety. 

Yes, I did not consume them in the traditional snuff, but I have never snorted anything and they say snorting Yopo is extremely painful and leaves you with a sore nose for days after. Yes, I did not mix the ground seeds with calcium carbonate or powdered lime, but again, I have read trip reports where people **only smoked ground seeds in a bong, with no other additives**, and have had a full-blown trip.

I will try these seeds again when I have the time, next time in a bigger bong with a bigger bowl, and maybe I'll try 15 seeds or so, because these 8 seeds did not do anything.

Anyone have any recommendations? What did I do wrong? I have a very low tolerance to all drugs, I have had an insanely powerful and beautiful trip on LSA (Hawaiian Baby Woodrose) and that is the only psychedelic I've done. I wonder what I did wrong...

2839,LSA,Morning Glory Seeds,"While scouring the internet for new ways to get high, i stumbled on a post claiming that there is a legal seed in Australia called 'Morning Glory' that you can consume that will make you trip to an-extent. At first i was unsure of the legitimacy of the post but then the more research i did on the seed the more i began to believe in it.

The morning glory flower is a blanket name for over 1,000 species of floral plants, but the seed needed to get high is from a specific type of Morning Glory. The Heavenly blue contains the most LSA (Also found in LSD) but the Flying saucer is also a good option.

Although the seeds are legal, it is not recommended that you buy a bag of them from your local nursery, for the farmers harvesting the seeds purposefully poison the seeds so they can't be consumed, if you ignore this and consume them anyway, it can lead to death if in high enough dosage. The only way to acquire safe seeds is by buying poisoned seeds then planting them and waiting for new seeds to appear near the end of fall.

When talking about how you should take/consume the seeds, some have stated that the best way is to leave the seeds in a cup of water, let it soak in for a few days then mix it with another better tasting liquid (something like Honey) then to drink. Others just say to eat them, but considering how many seeds you have to take to feel the effects (100-300) it might not be a good idea.

This is most of what i gathered during my research, but i am very interested to learn more, so please if you have any information on the subject, leave a comment. 

Also if you are interested in a first hand experience of these seeds, let me know, for i will be trying them in the near future and i am considering making a post about it.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ac5gd5/morning_glory_seeds/

2884,Methamphetamine,Don't do meth.,"I read on here a lot when I was naive, 16-17 years old, about how meth isn't as harmful as it's made out to be, it's the same as adderall, etc. Ended up using daily for very long periods of time, and now my brain is irreversibly damaged. Seriously, not even once is a decent approach to this one.

To elaborate, I started getting Vyvanse from my doctor when I was 16 years old. It made me more confident, full of energy, social, I performed better at work on it. Naturally, I started taking more than prescribed, started running out early. I needed a little extra each month so I wouldn't have to crash. In the US, the cheap, abundant most adderall like drug would be methamphetamine. So at 17 I bought a gram and started using it orally at work.

It was like Vyvanse in some ways, but it made me too confident, lasted too long, encouraged compulsive behaviors like marathon masturbation sessions, and of course, redosing. The paranoia was a surprise at first too.

I started losing weight and slipping into minor psychosis more often than not. Slowly but steadily my brain deteriorated, slow enough that it wasn't alarming, but 3 years in and it's clear my dopamine system is *fucked*.

I'm not really sure how to even communicate how the damage effects me, but to start, extreme lack of any motivated behaviors that I'm not forced to do. Music doesn't sound as nice. Masturbation is hugely effected, I can barely have orgasms sober. Pretty much all motivation and pleasure has been ruined for me.

There is also persistent minor psychosis all the time now. Very subtle audio hallucinations and strange thoughts, sometimes I notice my internal dialogue is complete non-sense throughout the day.   

Being functional after quitting is possible but it's miserable. 3 months sober and every day I was suicidal, and dreaded almost the entire time I was sober. SSRIs have helped quite a bit but leave a lot to be desired.

I don't think all hope is lost, I return to ""normal"" when on (very large doses) of stimulants, a high dose daily adderall or vyvanse maintenance regimen along with SSRIs would probably let me live a fulfilling life for sure.

I'm not trying to turn this into a pity party to be clear, but hopefully it sways a few young people from abusing that trash and fucking themselves up.

2914,Cannabis,Weed feels like lsd??,"I’ve tripped once and microdosed a few times with lsd, but I haven’t touched it since about March. I used to smoke a lot of weed over a year ago but now very sparingly. Recently when I’ve smoked it’s felt really different than it used to (I’ve gone several months w o smoking, just got back recently. Hadn’t really used it since I did acid). Last night it felt like half a tab, I started seeing those weird patterns and colors you see while tripping. It’s pretty intense, tingling body and fucked perception of time pretty reminiscent of lsd to me

Read out about it a bit and heard weed can change after psychedelics. I feel like I haven’t done enough of it for these effects (although my trip was very intense last February).

Colors brighter, noises a bit more distinct, sense of touch is different and when i would stare at anything longer than 3 seconds it would start to move or the things around it move ever so slightly but it is undeniable and sometimes makes me nauseous . It is jan 3, and im still experiencing this and I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced this before and how long it lasted. Im thinking of taking some CBD because of its antipsychotic properties but is this concerning, should i seek immediate help? Any feedback would be appreciated.

2974,MDMA,preventing the undesirable next day molly poops..,"(this is my first post and i apologize if this has been discussed.. i couldn't find a thread when i searched so feel free to point me in the right direction)

 i have been partying for over a decade now, enjoying the MDMA feels and house music since my first rave back in 2007. recently i have noticed that my stomach gets super shitty the day after i roll and it's super not fun! this NYE i got to rage with some old rave buddies and scored some amazing pressies and very clean molly crystals. the first pressie i ate was a blue ghost, which felt more like MDA but it was fun. the second pressie was an unknown cut, but it was straight fire! the molly crystals were disgusting going down but provided a very clean roll. so all together, i ate 2 pressies and a pinky dip.. so total mg of MDMA unknown but fuck, i felt amazing. i had been drinking all night- wine, beer, gin and tonics, some champagne. before the party i had eaten a gyro sandwich around 3pm and a nice big bowl of bean soup just before leaving the house for the party. so my stomach wasn't fully but not entirely empty. i also did some bumps of decent cocaine towards the end of my night. so all in all, i was expecting a decent hangover so before i put myself to bed i ate a burrito bowl and drank half a bottle of Gatorade. i also had been hydrating with water throughout the party, i couldn't tell you how many times i refilled my water bottle but it was a lot. i was dancing for hours, sweating and still urinating somewhat frequently.

  
the next day, i had pretty severe diarrhea. everything i ate literally blew right through me in a very painful manner. i know that MDMA (and shitty foods) can do this to your stomach and i was wondering if any of you had any tips on preventing such agony the next day. my stomach is back to normal.. but only after eating a bunch of tums, some chewable pepcid tablets and fasting. do you think eating such alkalizing things like Pepcid before I roll, or shortly after I start rolling, will help? also, what kind of foods do you like to eat before or after a roll? i know my diet wasn't ideal and i'd love to hear some input on what you guys eat and if you still experience the molly shits the next day.

2985,LSD,Took acid and had a strange experience. Advice welcome.,"Hey all. I've been using acid and other psyches for many years now. I contribute a lot of my personality and self to discoveries I made while I was tripping. I actually don't do them too often anymore unless for festivals though. I always thought I had pretty good control of myself even while tripping, but this last trip really shook me. Unfortunately I went a little insane this last festival and I think I damaged a really close bond I had. 

I took two tabs of acid, and my best friend took one. This was his first festival and I was excited to have him experience it. During the trip, I am not sure why I began thinking this, but I started to think that since we were such close friends that we were gay. We are both very much straight, but I think what happened in my head is that I thought since we were both men and felt love for each other, that meant we were gay even though it was obviously a very close platonic bond (this sounds so stupid to write out but this is the only way I can think of how I got to this conclusion). I also began telling him that a third friend of ours who was with us was also gay because he wanted to hang with us. Needless to say he was repulsed by all of this. He ran away from me and I just spiraled into a really bad trip. At the end of the night when i saw him again he avoided me and I drove home with a lot of suicidal thoughts. 

The next day my friend group made sure I was ok and invited me back for day 2 of the festival. I was feeling horrible, but upon seeing them all, they told me they understood that I just had some real insanity happen for a bit. My close friend said he forgave me. We all took mdma that night and had a great time for the rest of the festival. Fast forward a day or two and I think my close friend is still shook by the whole experience. We used to have great conversations as we had a lot of shared interests, but it's now really clear he's acting distant. Im really sad because he was like a brother to me, and now I feel I've ruined a close friendship. I'm not sure what to do. I guess I made it fucking weird. I have been beating myself up a lot over all of this. I just wish things could go back to how they were.

I realized I have some really fucked up things in my head. I'm gonna take a break from psychedelics for a while. 

I would love to salvage the friendship if possible. Anyone have advice I could use? Thanks.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ac7jzt/took_acid_and_had_a_strange_experience_advice/

3029,Cannabis,Crazy weed trip,"I know everyone says you can’t hallucinate or trip on weed but I had a crazy experience with it. 

So this occurred about a year and a half ago, I was at my buddies place ready to smoke up after a year long tolerance break. (Keep in mind I’ve been smoking on and off for about a year before that but never hit a glass bong before.) So he just got this new glass bong and we go to his room upstairs to smoke. Joining us, were his two dogs that just chilled in the room with us. So he packs be a huge ass bowl and puts some kief on top and me trynna be a badass I light the whole bowl and just wait for it to burn completely. This was a huge mistake because I had just come back from not smoking for a year. So I clear the bowl and instantly cough my lungs out, I was literally gasping for air and I yelled to my friend to get me something to drink. At that point I’m sweating badly and coughing about to throw up. He comes back and brings me a Dr Pepper and throws it to me on the bed, the dogs instantly see it thinking it’s a ball and jump on me. I was faded as fuck and it scared the shit out of me. So after the coughing session he wanted to go make some pizza downstairs and when I stood up to go down the stairs this is where everything changed. I was instantly hit with visuals and everything was elongated as if I had tunnel vision. When I get to the stairs I told him no way I’m going down them because it looked as if there were at least 20 flights of stairs. I make my way down eventually and I’m baked out of my mind with intense visuals. I sit down as he’s making the pizza and he turns on juicy by biggy. And I’m sitting there bobbing my head side to side looking down while both dogs are to my left and right side, everytime I would bob my head I would see them and their faces were morphing into that of lions. I started tripping out and started seeing my self from third person, I could see myself bobbing my head and my friend making the pizza even though I was looking down. I suddenly get an urge to throw up, so I fling up without saying anything and make my way slowly to the bathroom, at this point I didn’t hear anything but ringing in my ears. I put my head in the toilet and see my reflection in the toilet water and I thought to myself this is it, this is how I die and I just stared at myself in the water. I hear loud thumps as well as ringing, the thumps were my friend coming to check up on me. Eventually got up, without throwing up. And had no appetite whatsoever and just drank some water. We made our way back up to his room afterwards, and the dogs came with us. I lay down and look at one of the dogs and it barks, and I swear it said something to me. Then both dogs were looking at each other quietly barking, as if they were arguing with each other in English. I got the idea that they were my friends parents arguing about me and my friend smoking weed. I slowly close my eyes and my friend said I was rlly pale. The dogs instantly jumped on me and and started panting and making sad noises. This made me think I was dying, as I was very cold and pale. I tried keeping my eyes open but everytime I would close them, the dogs would jump on me to keep me awake and this made me panic. 

Eventually I fell asleep for a bit and woke up with a huge headache and went home. And no the weed was not laced, it was straight gas from a dispensary. 

TLDR: got super baked after a tbreak, had intense visuals, almost threw up and had insane audio hallucinations. Thought I was talking to dogs, and was thinking that I was about to die.

I sometimes have trips off of weed because I suffer from pretty bad anxiety that I take medication for. My question is, what “harder” drugs should we consider for this festival, if any at all?

We were looking at molly and shrooms but I am just really scared that I will have a bad trip and ruin the experience.

3126,Harm Reduction,Time for a long overdue and much needed empathogen. How do I reduce my chances of (and treat) seratonin syndrome? 6-APB and Duloxitine (Cymbalta),"ahh Benzofury.. It's not a benzo, and it's not furious. It is, however less neurotoxic than MDMA and, as someone with a fear of all psychedelics and a lot of trauma to process through, I'm planning my second ever dose of 6-APB with my partner. Problem is unfortunately I am on a low dose, daily SNRI (both norepinephrine and seratonin are being reuptaken) which is Cymbalta (Duloxitine) at 30mgs per day. 

I am trying to cut down my dose to lower and lower amounts so this trip can happen. I am very aware of the risk of serotonin syndrome (SS) and i'm looking for advice on what to do if I do happen to experience it, with all proper precautions being taken. I'm 20, F and weigh between 140-149lb. I have narcolepsy (fall asleep all the time) and am prescribed stims I take infrequently. im not lightweight but not heavyweight either by any means. drogas affect me

I have benzodiazepines on hand, as well as an antiepileptic drug called Topiramate (topamax) I use occasionally for sleep. Topiramate is shown to stop seizures, so im wondering if this might be a helpful resource for safety worst comes to worst. I have been gifted some quetiapine and olanzapine if antipsychotics effect SS. but idk.

Basically, I know the dangers in this combo but the benefits of the trip greatly outweigh the risks IMO if I can have proper precautions in place. I take dissos weekly and I'm prescribed vyvance. 

tl;dr how do I treat 6-APB induced SS if it ends up happening and has anyone here treated their SS at home successfully and how?

3172,Cannabinoids,Questioning my Weed habits (am I addicted?),"Hi there, I am (as it says in the title) questioning my Weed habits or more accurately my weed consuming. I wondered for some time if I am really addicted to weed because of certain factors I will mention. I hope you guys are able to help me with this question and able to endure this big text :)
(I hope I don't do any grammatical or spelling errors so I apologize in advance.)



So first off, I smoke mostly just to amplify my feelings when listening to music, playing it for myself (as I am a guitarist) or when playing video games. I don't need weed to enjoy those things at all but i just like to feel those things more...intimate, as I build up quite the relations with those things over the time (especially the music!).

I smoke quite regularly like 2-4 joints on a day in the weekend and 1/2 depending on how long my work day was...
(The amount of how much weed I put in a joint varies on how much I build up a tolerance to my main dealers strains. And I smoke mostly by myself).

As I said I dont need weed to enjoy my hobbies or any sort of social activity. I am even pretty cool with not having anything to blaze though sometimes I think to myself that I would enjoy smoking weed more than doing task xyz (Like if you think you would rather do something else than doing something your not quite comfortable with e.g having to work on a beautiful sunny day).

My Concerns come if I think about the amount I smoke as my tolerance forces me to smoke more but even so I get my shit done at work,at home and with my friends, but my worst concern (when thinking about if I'm addicted or not) is when someone ask me the infamous question...


""If you're not addicted why don't you stop smoking for a month?""

""I mean I could if I want to, but why should I stop enjoying myself all of the sudden? I don't have any problems resolving from my weed consume then why should I suddenly stop it?""
 

And this respone is what bothers me. Am I tricking myself into thinking that so I could find myself an excuse to continue smoking? I mostly think that I am not addicted due to how I handle my social and my own life.



I would appreciate if you leave your thoughts in the comments as this could help me dealing with this struggle of mine!

3281,Psychedelics,Trapped in his own head (TRIP REPORT),"A few days ago I was tripping on acid (150ug) with 3 close friends of mine.

On the comeup we started playing some read dead 2, getting very engrossed in it, and when we finally looked away from the screen, the visuals and the whole trip hit us like a fucking train.

It was a beautiful day so we decided to go for a swim, which was probably the most amazing and intense thing I've ever done: the water was shimmering hexagons with impossible geometry pulsing though itself underwater, and my friends were melting and folding into the water. It was definitely the most visual trip I've ever had. 
We were having a lovely time til we got out about 2 hours later and my friend started talking.

He seemed to be trapped in one enormous thought loop of 'understanding' saying the typical acid-head shit of ""I've figured it out"", ""like a dog chasing it's tail"",""consciousness streams"" and other things like that, but he wouldn't and couldn't stop talking. It was funny at first but that died so fast when he would follow us around talking at us and screaming about figuring it out, it felt very chaotic and tense and all we wanted to do was get away.

We tried everything to distract him and even tried to lock him in a room but he just kept getting worse, saying ""how do I stop time"", ""how do I get rid of a body"", ""can I kick holes in your wall"", ""give me a gun"" and ""why can't I just kill your cat"". He was referring to himself as another person, as if something had taken over his brain and he was just a shell. A couple of times we managed to bring him back to himself and he was very confused and tried his hardest not to slip back into it, but he couldn't.

We were freaking out but trying to stay calm, and we're normally completely non-violent people but we were really holding back to not hit him. 
This lasted for about 3 hours (felt like eternity) until he finally lay down watching a documentary.

Overall - even though it wasn't totally the trip we wanted - we all took some very good lessons from this, and wrote down some meaningful notes to ourselves. Not a trip I'm ever going to forget.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/acbi0w/trapped_in_his_own_head_trip_report/

I don’t really think the definition of it is up for interpretation. I think people that say ifs not a drug typically underestimate weeds impact on your psychological state simply because it doesn’t bother them or they don’t interpret it any deeper past “just smoking weed” I just don’t agree with it.

3378,MDMA,How I became an armed robber during an MDMA nightmare,"I’ve read that it is pretty common to have very extreme or even lucid dreams the following week after having md due to your brain chemistry or something. Anyways thought I’d share one of my many I have had since New Years that I honestly thought was real. 

Essentially I was in my local area walking back from buying a pack of darts from sevs and I passed this cafe that I always thought looked like shit, then out of nowhere I decided that I gotta rob the joint. I pull out a hand gun and proceed to kill two people inside taking all their cash. After doing so I started thinking what the fuck I just did and begun regretting everything. I went into full panic state and started thinking about how I was going to get out of this. I decided to put the money in an envelope and give back to the store. On doing so I was met with some junkie who had called the cops. I was arrested obviously despite trying to argue my innocence saying I had given the money back. Anyways in the cop car I kept thinking maybe this is all a dream and did everything I could to wake up, hitting myself (which I could feel) closing my eyes and I couldn’t. At that point I was full convinced I had actually robbed a store and fucked my life. Then I needed to piss which woke me up. Thank fuck. 

Got heaps more if yous interested that was just the most terrifying 

Edit: I have no intentions of robbing a store btw, none of my dreams have had any correlation to my life, just fucken whack shit",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/accplt/how_i_became_an_armed_robber_during_an_mdma/

3414,See Comments,Boofing Clonazepam instead of of Oral Ingest(Illness prevents swallowing),"I've never seen this as an option before, but I have a condition called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome, and I'm prescribed a ton of meds for it, phenergan, Zofram, Amityptaline, and Clonazepam. I have various forms of each of these except the Benzo. 

I'm on 1mg Tablet x30/script ""as needed"" for CVS. Previously I used to have a wicked 3mg Ativan/day script for about 3 years. (side note, getting off that shit was like having dementia and feeling like 80 years old. Extremely hard but rewarding as fuck when it was done)

My doc helped me get clean from the Atis, but because of my CVS I continue to get prescribed benzos as needed and while i love them immensely, the addiction turns me off and I only use them rarely when i REALLY fucking need them. 

Ok, this is getting long, let me break down my issue- When i catch an episode I start violently vomiting for anywhere from 6-30 hours, usually end up in the ER for dehydration. I'm able to stop these vomiting episodes if I can catch them at the right time with a combo of all the pills i mentioned above, and CBD oils. The problem is that I can't keep water down, I'm literally vomiting every 12 or so minutes, and i always throw up my benzos, not only wasting them, but since i need them, i don't want the doctor to think it's ""abuse""? Tbh, it's actually about 1/3 the script that comes right back up. 

So today I was lying in the bathtub cleaning off all the puke and I thought about sticking a couple up my booty, but I don't want to waste them by doing that if it's not a good idea, and I haven't *seen* any conversations regarding this kinda shit. 

Also, this is defs not for recreation, but for scripted purpose. Last question, are there other forms of Klons? Like liquid, or sublingual, ect? And due to the narcotic restrictions, would i have to get that sort of thing scripted from some one besides my normal GP/GI docs?

3514,Stimulants,Questions regarding Adderall use,"I’m in a bit of a unique situation with taking Adderall and I’ve googled this to hell but haven’t really come up with anything. 

Basic info: I’m 22, female. No history of illegal drug use or addiction in myself or my family. I’ve never smoked and no longer drink. I’ve been familiar with opiates for 5-6 years and benzos for around 3 years. All medications are prescribed by my doctor and I’m drug tested every month. 

Around six or so months ago, I was diagnosed with a neurological sleep disorder called Idiopathic Hypersomnia. In short: I have slept 24+ hours at one time (multiple times) without sleeping pills or having had been up a long time. It’s pretty debilitating. 

Typical treatment is stimulants, so I was put on Provigil first. It was great. I felt alive again. Unfortunately, I quickly learned I needed more than the maximum dose for it to work. I tried Concerta and it had no effect on me. My doctor switched me to Adderall. I started at 20mg twice daily. For a few days, this was okay. However, I noticed I needed 60mg daily to function well. I’m currently on that dosage. I experience no noticeable euphoria or change in mood. I truly only take it because I’m comatose without it. 

In addition to this, I take 2 Tylenol 3 (acetaminophen/paracetamol with codeine) twice per day for chronic pain. I’ve been on this medication at this dosage for more than two years. I’ve also been on a stronger opiate and had no issue going back to the Tylenol 3. 

My concerns are twofold. First, I’m concerned about experiencing any kind of negative neurological effects long term. I know that many people will say that Adderall is a methamphetamine equivalent and that in and of itself scares me. I don’t want to slowly lose my mind, you know? 

I’m also concerned about the addiction risk for me, personally. I know that Adderall is an extremely addictive medication. However, I take (and have previously taken) addictive drugs every day for long periods of time. I’ve never had an issue with opiates or alcohol. I no longer drink because of being on chemo and had zero trouble giving it up. I only ever take my pain medication when I’m in pain and have never stolen meds from others, even when I could have. I was previously on Ativan and only took it as needed and had no issue coming off of it. I’m just concerned because I feel like it’s a bad thing that I’ve needed to up the dose from my original prescription and because Provigil didn’t work for me. I know this could be because of the severity of my disease but it scares me a lot. 

I don’t believe I could ever stop/lower the dose of my Adderall. It’s scary being so dependent on a drug to have a life worth living, especially when I hear such horrible things about that drug. I’m scared this makes me an addict when I’m just trying to live. I feel like I’m constantly being chased by the most paralyzing feeling of sleepiness and the only way I can stay ahead is by taking Adderall.

3516,Methamphetamine,Meth and Sex,"Okay, so I am an experienced stimulant user with many years under my belt due to severe ADHD  and autism. Grew up like that since I was three. My recreational use of stimulants only started 2 years ago(I'm 20 and a half).  And holy fuck adderall sex was fun! 

Could fuck for HOURS. Didnt feel any better than normal sex though. More compulsive maybe but not THAT amazing. Anyways, moved to desoxyn and meth cause I took em for ADHD back in the day apparently and it blew my mind.

It was fucking medicinal. Tuned me into my emotions, calmed my racing mind, etc. No matter how much I take its not ""life ending"" euphoria. I then tried sex while on it, fully knowing the danger of sober sex never being the same....


And it's the fucking same. Meth and sex for me is no different than sober sex. Dosed up to 200mg of various sources. Every fucking time I dose It becomes therapeutic and shit too. Meth to me is functional and I hate it.

So with no time to spare I jump out of the shower leaving it running, grab my robe, and book it down the hallway.

But there's no time for celebration. I hear my older brother slam the front door and he's pissed. No time to think i run over to the main speaker and frantically start unplugging cords, all the while getting even more fucked.

But hes getting too close and its too early in the game for me get caught so i just rip that baby straight out of there ""i don't need that shit its bluetooth.""

3658,Zolpidem,Stay away from Ambien (seriously),"I'm posting this here because I feel I seriously need to warn people based on my experience and the experiences of people I know regarding this drug that is sometimes used recreationally. I don't want anyone to go through what I went through.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my story:

&amp;#x200B;

Friday (the 28th of December), I took one Ambien at 10:30pm so I could go to sleep. I laid down, closed my eyes, and tried to focus on counting sheep/etc. At 10:30am the next day, I was rushed to the ER for an overdose and they had to get hundreds of mgs of Ambien out of my system. Somehow I had unconsciously taken most of the bottle in my sleep and my parents heard me stumbling around in my room so they knocked on the door and I struggled, but managed to open it. I then almost jumped over the railing of the loft in my house and then ran into the bathroom for a few minutes and came back out after doing nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't remember any of this at ALL, but this is what I was told by my dad. He said he knew something was really wrong when I started yelling at my computer for no reason when it was just at the desktop screen and literally nothing was going on on the screen. My stepmom saw the open pill bottle and called 9-1-1 since she recognized what was going on. Apparently I thought I was invincible and tried to fight off the paramedics when they wanted to take me into the ambulance and they had to give me several shots of something to ""calm me down"" so to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I later drifted in and out of consciousness in the ER with several IVs in me (which I hated) and felt like I was in a dream. I don't remember anything in between taking the first pill and half-waking up in the ER. But apparently it was ruled as a suicide attempt, so I was ordered to go to the Psych Ward for 72 hours (which later ended up being 5 days because weekends and holidays don't count towards that time in my State).

&amp;#x200B;

The Psych Ward at the hospital I was at was full, so I ended up getting sent to a different place in the middle of the night without my parents being notified, because I'm 18. Well, it took them 2 days to find me after that and even then they couldn't do anything because it was ordered by a judge. Fast forward to today (Thursday the 3d of January) and I somehow got released ""early"" (because my time should have run out Friday the 4th at 2am). I actually learned a lot at the psych ward, but that's unrelated here.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm embarrassed to talk to my family (especially my dad and stepmom who were there) and I feel really bad for causing them so much worry and stress even though I couldn't do anything about it. I usually have really good control of myself under the influence of substances, but on Ambien, you're not usually conscious so you literally don't control what you do. I wasn't even taking it for recreational purposes, I was prescribed it for insomnia.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah, another thing, I actually punched a cop when they were trying to get me in the ambulance, and he chose not to retaliate due to my condition which I REALLY appreciate and want to thank him for. I never got charged for anything either, which was probably because it was an accident or luck idk. I'm a very nice person and would never hit anyone, but on Ambien I was an absolute raving maniac.

&amp;#x200B;

\-

&amp;#x200B;

Other stories I've heard from other people include sleep driving (and crashing), sleep eating (causing weight gain), sleep cooking (causing fires), causing disturbances on airplanes, hallucinating the morning after taking it, blunt trauma injury (due to falling down and being unable to move), getting fired from their job for actions caused by it, assault, battery, rape, unintentional suicide, vehicular manslaughter, and attempted murder.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, when you're on Ambien, you don't control your actions (and above 60mg you're probably not conscious at all) and since people take it recreationally, their chances of screwing their life up are higher than mine. I'm ok with people taking drugs recreationally, I am subbed here of course, but this drug is extremely dangerous and should be avoided. I honestly think it should be illegal at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: You can't control yourself on Ambien and I accidentally overdosed because it made me do it unconsciously and I almost died and embarrassed the hell out of my self in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

3718,Psychedelics,Why is there not a big 'Legalize LSD' movement?,"In regard to marijuana, people seem extremely outspoken against the hyperbolic danger the government attempted to frame the plant with. Yet there seems to be no outcry for LSD.

Personally, I think this might be because it is way easier to move and use LSD without being detected. Weed is smelly, big, with an arduous process to farm and harvest it. It can be detected for weeks in the system and months in the hair. This is almost the opposite for LSD. Therefore, the 'necessity' for its legalization is quite low.

What made me think of this was my experience at a new years party recently. This was my first time being at a party where there was a lot of drinking involved. I was tripping and watching everything unspool as the night went on. People were making awful decisions, some people were driving home on 6 or 7 beers. Looking back, I wonder if I should have done something to stop them, but I was afraid of getting ganged up on and shrugged off by all the party goers, so I didnt do anything.
Some people would not stop drinking. This one kid vomited all over himself as I was sitting beside him. A friend (sober) and I got him to a toilet where he would not stop vomiting, we got him water and kept him hydrated, and then once everyone was gone we helped the host clean everything up. 
I remember having my hand on that guys back, staring into the toilet as his pink vomit gushed into it, running down slowly like mashed potatoes, and thinking to myself: and Im the one on a schedule I drug right now.

Would taking 2 of them to start be overkill? I’d hate to take one and not really feel much of anything since I have a ton of tedious work to do today.

3816,Cannabis,Why do people romanticize weed so much then show such great disdain for those who feel the same way about drugs that aren’t weed?,"All my life I’ve seen people go from talking about how dangerous weed is to how great it is at helping people’s various problems, it’s a great painkiller, great antidepressant, it makes them feel comfortable in their own skin. 

I have all of these same feelings with meth, I’ve never gotten that “brighter lights and colors, euphoric” feeling from any kind of drug, meth included. However what I have gotten from it is the best fucking antidepressant I’ve ever tried. Even dealing with seratonin syndrome for a couple days I know that after I take that hit, my insecurities and self loathing start to melt away, I have confidence I never thought I’d have, I don’t feel even a fraction of the depression I’d usually be feeling, I’m willing to do things and have some kind of get up and go attitude towards life. It kills my anxiety, and oddly enough I prefer the taste to weed, battery acid over herb. Everything people use to sell weed to the public is what I feel using crystal, so why do people hate it so much more? Is it the addiction factors? The cost? The possibility of destroying your body? I think all of these things come from substances we put in our bodies every day, without even thinking about it. Coffee, nicotine, etc. the only time I’ve ever felt good about myself as a person is after I hit that bubble.

I smoked double maybe Triple what I usually did, and it was an intense ride. I had been smoking DMT for a while before so I thought I had nearly fully explored it's effects, but I was wrong. It took me to territory that I did not know was possible and a place I was not ready for. I feel ok now, but life just feels off.

3861,I :love: Drugs,Are 3 months (min.) as break enough?,"Hey guys.

So my (f, 20y/o, 54kg, 1,64m) drug usage has increased in the last months.
October 13th, 
I rolled xtc for the 2 Time (after 2 years) - dosage of max. 110 mg. 

Then I did it again on the 11.3., 
dosage was about 130 mg. I had a very great peak but I probably O.d. A bit. 

11.25. 
I did speed and had to re-take every hour because I sweated a lot while dancing
Next time was 7.12. Where I did first  ecstasy crystals,  after some time speed and then  weed. Had a very very nice Peak too.

29.12.
I did ecstasy again, in total I consumed 405 mg. - had a body feeling, but no euphoria.
(Took 2x 100mg 5Htp afterwards, which really helped the hangover) 

31.12, 
stupid me thought it would be a nice idea to destroy my body again because I planned on doing a break afterwards anyways, so I started with half a pill (135mg), felt the slightest bit, took half of the pill after, didn’t feel much, waited for an hour, took another half of another pill and then another half. In total? 540mg. And i really didn’t feel much. Then took 2 small lines of speed and smoked some J’s which really helped. 

I also always take benzos after rolling so I can sleep

I know I didn’t do harm reduction and I damaged my brain and body a lot.
No need to tell me again I think.
I just wanna know if a break of 3 months might take me back to my normal serotonin level and make me enjoy rolling again.

3954,Psychedelics,What should I do?,"Hi, this is kind of a long post, TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, basically I'm a 17 year old guy that has been really interested in chemistry and substances for about a year now. It started when for some reason psychedsubstace videos started appearing in my recommended section of youtube, I watched the nexus and mdma videos and simply got fascinated by the world that i had just discovered.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be the kind of guy that said that i would never touch a drop of alcohol, because i didn't think it was cool to see my dad doing stupid things, and i wouldn't like myself doing those things, but after seeing the videos, bringing the topic to conversation with people more experienced than I, reading posts online, etc, i became way more open and accepting of substance use. An idea got stuck in my mind, it's not use or consumption what makes substances bad, it's abuse, and even then it's not the substance's fault, it's ours for not regulating ourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that i have introduced you to my thoughts on this stuff, I'll continue with the situation.

About 2 days ago I told my mom about my interest in trying psychedelics, specially lsd and psilocybin, she knew about my general interest in substances but was not aware of me willing to try them. She acted in a way that was (i think) one of the best that she could have acted in, I exposed her all the things that make me want to try them, and also what could be the downsides, such as possible psychosis and heart disease if used frequently, i wanted to make it as honest as possible so she would know that i was not blindfolded or brainwashed by what the internet users that love them say, but more like aware of everything (most things xd) that come with using the substances. We both looked it on the internet, through research papers and things like that that could make her more informed about those substances, we even looked at those websites that show, or try to, how to deal with addiction and teens interested in drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

She basically looked concerned because of me getting expose to an addictive substance, nothing like ""Oh God what could have gone wrong with me raising this kid, now turns out he wants to be a drug addict"", but I'm sure that things like that could have been going through her mind, and might still be there. Then she came with the idea of calling a phone line of our city that helps with cases of depression, teens who abuse substances, people with suicidal thoughts, etc. She came up with this because over the last year, especially december, I've been  kind of depressed, I've always been socially anxious but for some reason this year (probably being more aware and afraid of it)  it got worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm only 17 which i know is quite a young age to use any psychoactive substance, but I'm really interested, not only in the psychedelic experience, but also in working on my problems in a different way than the one i've always had. I don't know if I should tell her to call the line for me to get a date or not, mostly because of the ways that it could go:

1. The person that helps us could be informed about it and say it's ok as long as i don't end up using something else, or abuse, and maybe tell me to wait some more time, but this is the least likely to happen.

2. The person that helps us is not informed at all, and might say that lsd and psilocybin are the worst things i could try, i'll get addicted from the first hit (might not even know how they are consumed), and i'll end up living under a bridge stealing and killing in order to get my next dose. This way my mom will become afraid of all of it and might never listen to me again, since i'm not a health expert and the person that said that i should even think about doing it, is.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a country that just doesn't think of drugs as something that could be used for other purposes than filling a void or trying to be cool, as most of the countries i think xd, and since these drugs are often sold as something, but are not the thing they are sold as (for example amphetamines that fit in a blotter being sold as lsd) they might even be misinformed trying to be informed by making local studies.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do, and the other option i can think of is doing more research and trying to convince my mom by myself, but as you might have seen I'm not that good with words xd, or maybe trying to make them forget the topic and waiting until I'm able to move out of my house and do the things the way i would like. I even think that by somehow asking for her approvance i'm acting kind of childish, and don't know if it was good to tell her about this. What should i do?

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: Told my mom about my interest in psychedelics, she responded quite openly and calmed about getting my situation to a health expert to see how bad it would be. Don't know if it's worth it or if i should tell her not to call, and talk about it again with more arguments and things that might get her convinced about it not being something that bad.

Sorry for my poor language, i hope the text is understandable. Thanks for reading, I'll be really grateful for any thoughts that i get.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/acjm9z/what_should_i_do/

3959,Cannabis,Debunking mysterious effects of marijuana (GONE BAD),"***BACKSTORY/INFORMATION***

&amp;#x200B;

I emplore any psychonaught or drug information enthusiast to read my post. If you believe yourself to be versed in drugs and to be able to explain difficult things then give this one a go. 

This post focuses on my personal effects of the use of marijuana which I believe to be a complete mystery. I have researched tons into my symptoms and I have yet to find anyone with similar experiences, maybe I will after this? But I somehow doubt it. To note, this is regarding physical unpleasant sensations triggered by smoking weed. 

To start with I feel it necessary to outline my past drug use, which I believe is definitely a big impactor on these effects, and if I were to not have done these I doubt these weed effects would be the same. 

\- firstly, my first 'weed' use was not in fact weed but synthetic cannabis/spice, which you can imagine doesn't set you up nicely for a wholesome experience of weed in later life. I didnt smoke for a couple years after this incident, but through time have slowly developed a love for marijuana, and smoked it on a daily basis for the past 1/2 years, with short breaks. 

\-*Psychedelics*: 2cb, acid, 4aco, truffles. 

\-*Stims/others/party drugs*: coke, ket, speed, xans, valium, etc. nothing which I'd consider a big deal to do **when kept within moderation**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, if you're still with me I appreciate it :) 

&amp;#x200B;

***DESCRIBING EFFECTS***

&amp;#x200B;

(Recommend reading backstory/information first otherwise you might be confused)

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get into describing the symptoms, its important to note: 

I am not suggesting these effects are physical, but they *feel* very physically prominent 

Me trying to explain what happens during **bad trips** on marijuana: 

\-A physical feeling on weight pressing down upon my face, like a blanket of weight fully surrounding my face. When brought to the front of my psyche, it becomes more and more prominent/painful. Normally, I can slip out of this zone and have a happy time with marijuana. 

When smoking a lot/edibles/chance, these symptoms occur (these have happened to me maybe 3 times over my life, considering that I have smoked a lot of days, the occurence is rare: 

\-A physical feeling like there is a mass inside my body, comparable to a rat but more of a vague mass. This mass can sporadically move around my body, physical feeling of pain coming along with it. It can run up my arm, up my throat into my face and mouth, it can jab at my insides, and can even focus around my heart. 

\-A physical shooting through my body, unexplainable, unidentifiable, but as if something inside me has just burst, is causing pain, emitting a white noise *feel* to it (like the unpleasant feeling of hearing a high pitched noise randomly). 

\-When I mentally think and focus on these horrible sensations, the pain aspect gets more intense and more frequent until I am in a state of physical torture. When in this mental zone, I can compare the fear and pain to that of a bad acid trip, but as marijuana is not as mentally potent, it is a physical trip. 

Pain itself is a **mental release** from the brain when it feels the body is in danger. Therefore, it is not impossible that physical pain can be felt (minor or significant) when no physical damage is actually occurring. And if you disagree, then stop reading, because I have broken several bones, felt pain in many forms, but this has to be the worst physical experience I have been through. 

My theory:

Smoking spice (at age 14) before i smoked bud has significantly altered my marijuana experience, in these cases, for the worse. 

When I used 4aco and smoked I experienced the 2nd occurence of the above symptoms, the one before was less intense, and that significantly altered future experiences (such as the 3rd occurence), to be more intense. 

The 3rd occurence was last night, so I'm taking a break from draws for a while, understandably, so I don't need to hear this suggestion, already on it ! 

&amp;#x200B;

NB: My marijuana experience has been more positive over my life, I do not dislike marijuana but I do dislike the seemingly random and unexplainable episodes that have occurred. 

&amp;#x200B;

Peace out, everyone have a good day, and thanks *I appreciate it if you read this whole thing* :))

3978,I :love: Drugs,I saw God on Xtc,"I went to a party on new year's eve and took around 200mg xtc. Before taking it I was already in a great mood. The stuff hits me like 20 minutes later and I have a great time with my friends dancing on techno and house music. They had nitrous balloons for sale at the party and I decide to do one alone. I sit down, close my eyes and start counting my inhalations. I was peaking at this moment and at around my 15th inhalation it happened.

I start seeing this super bright light. I can best compare it to light that shines into a completely dark room through a tiny gap in a curtain, only this light had layers and it was not blinding. I don't have the words to describe it yet I will try. It felt like a giant organism that was also an endless musical composition. It was totally infinite, billions of years were nothing to it. It was this eternal pulsating being of goodness and love. I felt liked it understood my suffering, it told me without words that my suffering means nothing in comparison to eternity. Despite this I still felt this unending compassion coming from it. Inside the light it was safe nothing could harm you there. All life was drawn to it. Then it ended and I was pulled back into reality. 

I opened my eyes, I now was on top of my xtc peak and everyone around me was dancing on this beautiful music. I imagined I saw myself sitting there with my pupils maximally diluted staring at the party in front of me. I knew what I just saw was the truth. Nothing ever felt more real. I then started dancing with my friends and it was the best night of my life. 

Now I am sitting here writing this about 4 days later and I am wondering if I experienced some kind of schizophrenic attack (never was diagnosed) that night. The whole experience still feels very real but my sense of judgement was obviously clouded by the pills. I'm still trying to figure this out as it is the closest I ever came to a spiritual experience (if those exist).

3997,MDMA,Best XTC I’ve ever tried,"So I get so much info on here but I rarely see people recommening E. People always talk about their amazing experiences with the substance and often don’t think about sharing what type of pill they had.

Let me first of say that I’m fully aware of known pills being remade in different labs and that their effects can be totally different, as they’re advertised as something they’re not.

I remember my first time rolling being abseloutely incredible as it is for must of us. My first time I did clean molly crystals and almost 2 years has passed since that day. Every roll after that has either been shit stuff that was tested to be mdma, or shit even shittier xtc pills that was no where the experience I had my first time. I even got some molly from a nationwide known rapper where I live (Norway), but that still could not compare.

I alwayd spaced my rolls with at least 3 months, and I was SURE what EVERY DAMN PERSON on here said about nothing’s ever gonna beat your first time, was true.

Let me tell you. I’m a living proof of being proud to say that it’s not true. I rolled on new years eve, and this was only 1 and a half month since last time I rolled. This roll was INTENSE. I only consumed one xtc pill and I was so fucking high I had to lay down with my GF on the bed for about 15 minutes because the experience was a lot to take in. It was 2x the experience I had my first time. It was AMAZING.

The pill was a prefect sample of the qp batch (phillip plein). It was the pink version. 

For anyone who’s looking for one heck of a ride that pill is the way to go. It is hella strong, so only the ones who like and are able to handle strong xtc should go with a whole pill. I swear the god I thought I was gonna die at the comeup because I was peaking and peaking and peaking AND peaking I thought it would never stop. Also I had abseloutely no comedown. It was amazing.

4039,MDMA,First time on Molly(story),"Ive been debating on sharing this one. Kinda struggled to believe it myself for a while but ive come to terms with it and its true

So way back in october my friend drags me to a rave and hands me a 150mg tab soon after we get through the joke they call security. I go into the bathroom, sit down and just stare at it nervously. I was a virgin to all of this, ide just smoke weed every once in a while. But i cast aside my morals and fear and popped it.

I walked back to the danceroom and started getting bad anxiety thinking ""why tf isnt this kicking in"" i eventually got dragged into the epicenter of the crowd. While i was there it finally came on. A rush of euphoria came over me. Felt alot like i was falling in love, but with no specific person just everybody in general. Bumping into people in the crowd felt fucking good. I used to hate that. Gave me horrid anxiety. Now i just didnt care.

Out of nowhere i noticed i had bad cottenmouth so i got water and went outside back of the venue and just talked it up and hugged the other people rolling. Took me a decond to realize but i was cold so i eventually went back inside, met up with the friend i came with, ended up redosing with another 150mg then hit the dancefloor again. Eventually it came to a end, and we walked out to his car and sat there for like 20 minutes collecting our thoughts. 

It had mostly wore off at this point so we said fuck it and drove back to his couch. I went and laid on the couch and tried to sleep. Got some minor closed eye visuals. Took me 3 hours to actaully crash. 

Woke up the next day at 1pm. I felt joyful, my anxiety wasnt there, nor was my depression. Till this day i still dont have that depression. Still a anxious fuck, but not as bad anymore. That night also taught me to stop being so cynical and well ive been more alot more optimisitic since.

The Vyvanse will not dissolve in the water so it acts as more of a suspension. Thus it’s important to shake the bottle well before each sip. By sipping this concoction I feel it absorbs better, as less of the amp is destroyed by stomach acid because it’s being diluted. It also makes for a slower more even come up, which is already present with Vyvanse.

I can only remember bits and pieces from that night but I remember everything that happened with me and her.

I guess what I’m asking is how do I change looking back at the night I had with her, and crying and being angry at myself that I didn’t do things different, or taking advantage of the fact that for once a girl might be into me, to being able to look back on it and laugh and feel happy without this crushing nostalgic urge to want to do it all again and staring longingly at the phots and videos we took together on my phone? :(",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/acmpag/need_advice/

The process:
-brush your teeth and the rest of your mouth 
-chew about 2-3 sticks of your favorite chewing gum
-chew for about a minute 
-take gum out 
-place about .1-.2 grams of salvia extract and fold your gum so it’s covered 
-chew your extract gum for 10-20 minutes don’t swallow your salvia 

     The high lasted about 2 hours with afterglow effects lasting all night. It was like a cross between really mild dmt effects and magic mushrooms but an expirence all of its own.

I only took it for a period of 3 weeks last year when I was going through different antidepressants. It scared me, because it got me so fucked up. I compare it to speed, because I feel similarly about meth and the bittersweet memories I have of the 1 week I tried it. Effexor gave me the same sort of racy, heart pumping, brain buzzing euphoria, but better. 

Usually antidepressants take anywhere from a few days, to several weeks for them to ""kick in"" and the affects to be noticed, I felt this shit day 2. Didnt want to sleep, didn't want to eat, didnt really want to do anything except sit there and marvel at how unbelievably PRESENT it felt. 24/7 for those 3 weeks. Buzzing and vibrating like your step moms sock drawer. 

Took me 1 week of tapering a 1 week of feeling like absolute shit to get off it. Fastest I've ever felt withdrawal symptoms after starting any meds too.

Not even next week I had the shittiest day ever and an idea popped out to take it again but in pill form so I did so (Even the dealer told me to wait at least a week). Everything feels good but I'm still worried is it possible that I damaged anything? I know that I did something stupid.

4739,In memoriam,My new years resolution,"So a few days before new years I took ~30 mg of 4-aco-dmt. I went skiing at my local ski hill and blasted some tunes and shredded for most of my trip (best thing ever btw). While I was skiing I realized that drugs are distracting me too much from my life. I don't love skiing as much as I used to. Which made me tear up a bit since it's my all time favorite thing to do. I'm a competitive skier and I decided then and there on the hill I'm going to quit drugs (I'm a recreational poly-user) to focus on my skiing career and hopefully make the Olympics one day. I told all my friends I'm quitting to ensure they won't let me do any drugs in case I get weak at some point and also help me. They were very suprised as I've been known as the 'druggie' in my friend group. So on new years day I quit all drugs except caffeine and kratom (which I'm going to taper off this month). Quitting nicotine was the hardest imo out of opiates, stims, and psychs (Ik not addictive but still a drug I used often). I've never been more proud of myself and also bored. I didn't realize how much time I just spent being high and doing unproductive shit. Leave some recommendations to help spend my time more wisely.

4909,Clonazepam,Mixed Adderall and Kpin.,"So the first time the other day, I decided that I wanted to try a 30 MG Adderall with a 1MG Kpin. (Klonopin for those who don't know).

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought it would have been a bad idea since one gives you energy while the other sorta ""Slows"" or ""Calms"" you down. But to my surprise it was quite the experience.

The Kpin kept me from getting shaky, (I usually get a little shaky when I take an Addie). Usually because I already get anxious as is, Adderall helps with controlling that in its own weird way.

I felt very energetic and ready to actually finish stuff I needed to do in the outside world. I felt very calm and not to overly excited like I usually do when taking just the adderall by itself.

My thoughts felt more clear as someone with Focusing problems ""ADHD"", Adderall only helps with keeping me ready to do stuff and maybe a little focused sure. The Kpin Kept my mind calm in situations that I would normally overthink about when on adderall.

I do see myself addicted to adderall but in a way that doesnt  necessarily affect me negatively, I dont stay up days on end but I do love the effect adderall has on me.

I remember sitting and playing a little bit of Counter Strike with a few online buddies while under the influence of both these drugs, My callouts were crisp and clear. I also found myself staying very calm but also focused while in tough situations such as 1v3s.

Has anyone else mixed these 2 particular drugs before? Maybe more than I have? As I said I only have done it once. If you have any similar stories of mixing uppers and downers I wouldnt mind hearing some.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/acs8a9/mixed_adderall_and_kpin/
4931,benzos,Klonopin and Xanax together,"Ok so my doc prescribed Klonopin to take during the day basically because I left my Xanax with my dad and he won’t mail it, and I can’t get more Xanax for another month.

The Klonopin works nicely for the generalized anxiety but DOES NOT HELP MY PANIC AT ALL HOLY SHIT

So I did some frantic googling but I’m so scatterbrained and dissociating and panicking at the same time that I didn’t know what to do.

I had 2 mg of Klonopin in the few hours at work before bed. Didn’t really work. I’m having a BPD depressive episode which makes me panic and want to kill myself so I take Xanax usually to make it go away.

Well I took another half Klonopin, waited an hour and nothing.

So I grew a pair and just took 1mg Xanax. My usual dose is 1.5-2 Xanax so I have no idea what’s gonna happen and I’m scared. My bf is snoring so loud so he can’t hear my panicky breathing or crying but he’s here in case u know I die or something.

So in total in the past 5 hours I’ve had 2.5 Klonopin and 1 Xanax.
And my tolerance is usually 1-2 Xanax.

Bad idea, I know, but I was so close to jumping out my 6 story window, so drugs are obviously the better choice in this situation. I think lmao.

Soooo has anyone experienced this before or taken benzos together?? Any advice, warnings, stories?",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/acsfv8/klonopin_and_xanax_together/
4935,Lorazepam,Ativan for flying,"So I’m flying for the first time in 20 years in a few days and I’m rather nervous about it. I’ve been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder as well as Panic Disorder which obviously makes things a lot worse. I also have really bad claustrophobia and the thought of being on a cramped tube in the sky almost sends me into a panic attack in itself... I personally don’t have a prescription for any meds but I obtained some 2 mg Ativan from my mom. 

I’ve taken Ativan before and it helps my anxiety immensely, but it has been a while and I’m not sure how much to take for the flight/when to take it. I’m flying from Portland OR to West Palm Beach FL - about 8 hours in the air total. I’m just worried about the Ativan wearing off 3/4 of the way there and freaking out. I don’t want to be knocked out per se, just calmed down for the whole flight . 

I should add that I’m on the larger side - 6’3” 205 pounds. Should I just pop an entire 2 mg tab on my uber to the airport? Or maybe cut it in half? Wait until I’m on the plane ?

4975,I :love: Drugs,Advice for getting high on a beach far from civilisation,"So yesterday my mother called and told me we are gonna go to the french atlantic coast for two weeks in april. We are going to the area of Montalivet and we have been there a lot of times.

I always really enjoy going there, but this time I want to make it extra special. So there is an extremely big stretch of beach which is miles away from any civilisation and I always went there to think about life, and where I stand.

When I go to that isolated beach again I want to get high, but I have 4 choices of drugs: 2C-B, ecstacy, weed from a bong and LSD. I'd really like to take 2C-B but the effects last for way too long, so I think I'll go for ecstacy.

But what would you choose to take when you go to such an isolated but big space? Or if you already did something similar what did you take?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/act072/advice_for_getting_high_on_a_beach_far_from/
4993,Antidepressants,Knowledge sharing for those on SSRIS,"

After I medical detoxed from alcohol on benzos I started on lexapro. Fast forward two years of adjusting medications, etc and I feel great except three things: I noticed my weed highs sucked really bad and my orgasms were trash. My sex drive was also ruined. 

After doing some reading i found that lexapro can depress your dopamine. Well weed allegedly depresses dopamine as well leading to me being a lazy piece of shit. 

I read about Wellbutrin being a NDRI (increases dopamine) and decided to tell my doctor. She agreed to put me on it and since then my weed tolerance has been cut in half! I smoke half a bowl in my bubbler and I’m absolutely fucked with no anxiety lol. 

TLDR; if you’re tired on lexapro and love smoking weed every day, Wellbutrin may make your high better. Has anyone experienced this?

5142,Long Post,"""The 10 Commandments Of Safer Drug Use"" [From the HonestDrugBook.com]","##Always remember that your life is in your own hands. Should you choose to use a psychoactive substance, this framework may help you to take more measured and informed decisions.

1. Research, research, and research. Use the internet, consult books, ask those with experience, and take your time about it. There is no imperative to rush, but there is imperative to get it right. Know as much as is reasonably possible about the chemical or botanical you intend to use well before you do so.

2. Source carefully. How confident are you that the substance is exactly what you expect it to be? Is it likely to have been cut with something undesirable? Could it be something close to, but not exactly what you ordered? Could something have gone wrong during manufacture or transport? Does your source have any sort of reputation?  
When you have obtained the substance itself, the safety process has barely begun. Don’t succumb to temptation to shortcut any of the following steps.  
3. Test it. Reagent testing can be used to identify many popular chemicals, and this isn’t rocket science to undertake. Test kits can be easily purchased online, and basic guides are abundant. [Here is a HOW TO 30 second drug checking tutorial GIF]( https://imgur.com/jGQJtWo). On [the wiki of r/ReagentTesting you can find a ton of additional info]( https://old.reddit.com/r/ReagentTesting/wiki/how_to_reagent_test)    
An alternative is to use a third party service, such as WEDINOS, the Welsh Emerging Drugs &amp; Identification of Novel Substances Project. With an online generated form, substances can be sent anonymously for free laboratory testing, with the results being published for your perusal on the WEDINOS website.  
Similar services are now provided by organizations in a number of nations, using a variety of operational models. Examples include ecstasydata.org and energycontrol-international.org. Many festivals also provide on-site testing services.
If you are less than 100% certain regarding the content or purity of your substance, testing it is an absolute must-do.  
4. Invest in, and use, some milligram (0.001g) scales. It should be obvious that dosing is a central issue, and that many chemicals are extremely dose sensitive, including at low levels. Don’t scrimp on or bypass this matter under any circumstances.
&gt;A quick layman’s guide on how to use your scales:  
&gt;• Take the pan off your scales and turn them on.  
&gt;• Place the pan back on the scales. It will show a weight, perhaps something like 2.671g.  
&gt;• Press the tare button, and then remove the pan.  
&gt;• The scale will now read -2.671, or whatever the weight of the pan was.  
&gt;• Place the substance in the pan, and place the pan back on the scales.  
&gt;• The scales will now show the weight of the substance.  
&gt;
Bear in mind here that most scales are not precise enough to weigh accurately at the individual milligram level, but do tend to be reasonable for perhaps units of 10mg. If the intended dose is in the single milligram range, you will need a set of high quality scales or a set of microgram scales.
For smaller doses, perhaps of less than 1mg, or in the low milligram range, an approach known as volumetric dosing is commonly used. This involves dissolving a known quantity of a compound into a liquid, and then measuring the dose by millilitre, via the mg/ml ratio created.  
For substances that do not dissolve in water, liquids such as alcohol or propylene glycol are used. It is worth remembering that the lower the concentration of the substance in the liquid, the easier and safer it is to dose.  
TripSit offers an excellent guide to volumetric dosing on its website:http://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Quick_Guide_to_Volumetric_Dosing  
One last word on dosing: caution and concentration are vital. Take all sensible measures when handling chemicals, preferably using gloves and eye protection.  
5. Properly and rationally consider the dose. Have regard for your circumstance, and all the information you have accumulated about the drug. If you are in a social setting, do not succumb to peer-pressure.  
Always remember that you can take more if you need to, but you cannot un-take what you have already taken. This is something I cannot emphasize enough.  
If this is the first time you have used this drug, you are introducing a new chemical into your body and you do not know how it will react. A low dose will usually reduce the risks to your personal safety and psychological well being, including the prospect of having an overdose or a bad experience.  
Take your time to explore, tread carefully, and don’t make hasty decisions.  
6. Perform allergy tests. The risk here may appear to be small, but in some cases the impact of a serious allergy could be fatal.  
Measure the smallest amount of the substance that you can. Then split it into smaller amounts. Place one part of this under or on to your tongue. If you experience any irritation, swelling or soreness, you could be allergic. Pending further tests and assurance, do not consume the substance in any way.  
Note that allergy testing can also help to verify that you haven't acquired something significantly more potent than you intended.  
7. Ask yourself if you are feeling okay. It is a serious question. If you are unwell, sick, or in poor health, these conditions may be amplified during the experience, or may have serious implications with respect to body load. If in any doubt, don’t proceed.  
This also applies to mental health. Some drugs can intensify whatever mood, feeling or psychological space you are experiencing at present. They may take you higher or lower, in terms of your current mental state, and hold you there. This can extend for uncomfortable periods with respect to the latter. This potential manifestation applies equally to both popular and uncommon drugs.  
Delay or abandon the experience if there are any doubts or concerns.  
8. Plan the experience, and its parameters, so that you don’t take rash decisions under the influence. Having taken whatever dose you have chosen, be patient, and don’t jump to the conclusion that it didn’t work, should onset not materialize. A common mistake is to double-dose, which can have dire consequences. Equally, unless you actually intend to redose at the outset, it is suggested that the rest of the material is placed out of immediate re ach. If redosing is intended, perhaps place a maximum cap on this by having o nly a pre-determined total amount available to you.  
Carefully consider set and setting: the place and circumstances under which you are going to undertake the experience. For psychedelics this will often determine the nature of the trip, and it can sometimes induce a bad or damaging ordeal. Consider the use of a trip-sitter if you are not experienced with this particular class of drug.  
Have to hand water, food, or whatever other provisions or entertainment you are going to need.  
For all psychoactives, bear in mind that your judgement and functionality may be severely impaired, which could be a significant factor if you are likely to find yourself in a public place, or indeed, any location in which you may be subjected to risk or danger.  
9. Have the contact details of help services to hand in case of urgent need. See Section 4 for some options. Write down what you are dosing and place the note in a prominent place on your person. In the worst scenario, this may assist the emergency services.  
If you are undertaking the experience with a group, seek to nominate an individual to abstain, in case help and objective rationality is needed.  
10. Give your body plenty of time to recover and your mind due time to assimilate the experience. In other words, if you are a regular drug user, take a break between psychoactive sessions, and a long break between sessions using substances from the same class.  
The former helps to ensure that the experiences do not become more intrusive in your life than you want them to be, and the latter helps to manage tolerance and reduce the risk of addiction. Under no circumstances allow yourself to habitualise drug use (including alcohol).

5151,Psychedelics,LSD: First Trip Report,"First time trying acid trip report

I’ve been wanting to try acid for a while so two friends and I decided to get an Airbnb for 3 days, try acid, trip and relax.  Although I’d read quite a bit on reddit, research articles etc, nothing could’ve prepared for for the ride it turned out to be. 

1530: I and my two couple friends, C &amp; F arrive at the Airbnb, quickly unpack the car, get comfortable and take the tabs. We each took one of 3 small tabs about the size of a quarter of a tic-tac. We put them under our tongue for around 5-10 minutes. Mine started to get soft so I just swallowed it. We were all taken aback at the lack of taste it had. We were expecting something bitter or metallic tasting but it tasted like nothing. 

1600: 30 minutes in and I’m beginning to laugh uncontrollably. I’m worried that it’s the placebo affect because of the tabs tasting like nothing and because my friends aren’t feeling anything. I’m starting to feel lightly anxious (vaguely similar to the comeup on Molly) my body is feeling weightless and I’m finding everything unbearably funny. I turn on Narnia the movie so I have something to focus on. F is anxiously fiddling with a neon glow lamp, and C is feeling slightly anxious as well. At this point it’s unsure if it’s a placebo affect, or if we’re actually feeling something.

1630: The House is breathing, the walls and floor and trees are all breathing. Yea I’m tripping🤣. At this point I’m unsure if C &amp; F are tripping. I feel out of control and doubtful as to whether they are experiencing this the same. I’m laughing uncontrollably and in awe of everything. Colors or more vivid, and everything, absolutely everything, is breathing. F decides to put on a video by Pharrell and Katy Perry and it’s overwhelming. The colors, the sounds the abrupt “switch” between scenes. I get it. So much art is actually trying to capture what the world looks like on LSD. I begin to feel very overwhelmed, so I go lay down in another room on the bed. I find the ceiling overwhelmingly fascinating. F’s lamp that is pulsing with color is casting a spectacular glow on the ceiling. The ceiling is breathing and swirling. C &amp; P come lay next me. I can tell that I am definitely tripping loads harder than they are. F attempts to change the music as he can sense how overwhelmed I am. He changes the song to You &amp; I any Galantis. Which is my favorite song😩. I’m overwhelmed by this wave of happiness/grief and start to cry. I’m happy because my friends are here and I love this song, but sad because I know I’ll never have what the song is talking about. I’m alone. This feeling of overwhelming sadness quickly passes and once again I’m enamored by the beautiful swirls and colors all around me.

1700: C, F &amp; I are all in full trip mode🤣. We are laughing uncontrollably and stumbling around the house like three drunken idiots. We feel weightless, our bodies are feeling simultaneously numb, tingly and amazing. I begin to feel trapped by the moving, breathing, house. The pulsing light lamp, geometric YouTube videos my friends have playing in the background, and structure of the house begin to feel too overwhelming. I panic slightly and open the door. Immediately I feel an overwhelming sense of calm, as though inside the house is a fake plastic world keeping me trapped and outside is freedom and beauty and life. I open and shut the door a few times, almost enunciating the stark difference between inside the house and outside the house. I quickly tell my friends to stop what their doing and come look. We are all in awe of how beautiful outside is. C being the practical one helps me put on sandles so we could go sit on the patio. Since it’s an Airbnb, the door has a key pad code and not a key. We all begin worrying about getting locked out. C &amp; F decide to write down the code on all of our wrists. The act of me finding a pen (one was in my purse) is extremely difficult. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I hand the pen to F who begins to write shapes on my wrist. The shapes are numbers and are pulsing and moving as he write them on my wrist. He’s having a hard time writing. We go outside and sit on chairs under the patio. Nature is overwhelmingly stunning. The greens of the trees and blue of the sky is vivid and breathtaking. I feel as though everything is breathing, pulsing and swirling. When I look up at the sky I understand that the Sistine Chapel was painted to look like the sky on lsd. At this point my friend K video calls us. She’s known that I’ve wanted to try acid for a long time and is happy at how well the trip is going. She asks how I feel. I tell her that I feel like I just had the most massive orgasm of my life. My entire body feels boneless, utterly relaxed, and absolutely amazing. It’s all I can do to just sit back and relax with my legs up on the table. I am aware of how the three of us look outside with our legs up on the table, arms dragging on the floor, mouths open in awe and wonderment of nature around us. Yea we look like idiots 🤣. I find myself doubting whether F &amp; C are really experiencing this as I am.... because this is insane. A random cat appears outside and begins purring, meowing incessantly and interacting with us. We are “spooked” by the cat. I wonder aloud if the cat can sense that we are tripping.

1730: it’s hard to believe that we only took the tabs 2.5 hrs ago. It feel like a lifetime. At this point constructs such as reality and time begin to lose their meaning. C, F &amp; I are sitting outside with our legs up on the table. Nature is beautiful and my friend T video calls. K told him I took acid 
&amp; he calls to check up on me. I tell him the world is breathing. He grins and tells me he’s in Costa Rica. I find this incomprehensible. Distance/time/Reality are constructs I am struggling to perceive. I am talking to him but he’s far away........ the confusing thoughts dissipate. As I look at C &amp; F their faces begin to look too similar. Similarities in their facial structure begin to become glaringly obvious. I cannot stop staring. Their faces begin to swirl/pulse and take on a hazy texture. Suddenly F’s face begins to melt, followed by C’s. I quickly close my eyes and tell myself that I know C &amp; F. I open my eyes and their faces are back. I breathe a sigh of relief. The sun is beginning to set, and the sky is beginning to darken. Mosquitos begin biting us and C &amp; I are itching uncontrollably. We decide to re-enter the house.

1800-2130: Upon re-entering the House I immediately feel trapped. The house is breathing. The floor is shifting, the light pulsing lamp that is switching colors continually pulsing and recoloring the room. My depth perception is completely off. I believe that the house is a ship and begin stumbling about the house attempting to “catch” my balance. Unfortunately for C &amp; F, I begin verbalizing my beliefs about the house which causes their perception to change. We all begin stumbling about the “ship”. C finds the ship engine in the laundry room. I find it dark and menacing back there and immediately throw “it” away. I don’t want the “ship” to turn dark. Somehow K is on the phone and F, C &amp; I begin frantically telling her the house is a ship and that we are trapped. “Trapped in the house that is a ship. We can’t get out. The house is a fishbowl.” We then enter a new belief. The house is a fishbowl house, it’s not real and everything is actually a reality show. The Airbnb house is a trap, it’s a playhouse, it’s not real and “their” watching us. (We become stuck in this thought loop for some time. Trapped because to be fair the Airbnb is quite small, a 2bed/1bath, and there are no real blinds on the windows of the house. You can easily see into the house at night. So in our minds the house was a toy house, outside the house was unsafe because “they” are watching us. The house felt small and cartoonish. It was also still breathing and pulsing with colors. The size of the house was completely distorted.) We stay in this train of thought for quite some time, talking over each other stumbling about the house with all the lights off. Time has no meaning, and i am no more than and confused jumble of thoughts. Who am I? Where am I? What is here? Who are they? As I write this, I realize that it sounds scary but at the time these thoughts were not “scary”. They were simply thoughts that had no underlying mood or emotion. I felt as though I were a being above all of this. My comprehension was on such another plane that certain things were beyond me. The two other beings in the structure with me (my friends C &amp; F), who/what are they? They had some relation to each other and me which completely escaped me. All that existed in the house that could be pieced together were a whirlwind of thoughts. At times we would all connect to fuel the whirlwind only to lose it again.

2200: the peak of tripping has finally let up. Throughout the experience I had to remind myself and the other beings that “hey we are absolutely tripping balls right now”. Our collect thoughts have finally quieted enough for me to refocus our energy on a movie. I decide to play Marie Antoinette. We have a hard time making sense of the movie. The constructs of countries and relationships are extremely hard to grasp. I vaguely understand what is occurring, and each interpretation of what is occurring feels groundbreaking. The movie is a moving Work of art. It is breathtaking and beautiful. Utterly mesmerizing. I see new and beautiful shapes in patterns on the wallpaper of the movie. In their hair. Everywhere. It is awe inspiring. C &amp; F continually pause the artwork to disclose revelations. I find this tedious and hard to grasp and attempt to refocus on the moving artwork. 
 
Conclusion: all in all I consider this a very decent trip. I left out the last 5 hrs because this post was so long (sorry) and I got tired of writing it🤣. I wanted to write and post this while it is still fresh in my mind. I’m a bit disappointed I didn’t have a spiritual connection with God though. At one point of my trip I looked up at the ceiling and said “well god, this would be the time to make an appearance”. 10/10 would do it again🤣🤣",34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/acv6l2/lsd_first_trip_report/

5193,Opioids,What happens next?,"TL;DR: I've started using opiates daily and my tolerance is growing quickly. I know I should want to stop, but I don't. Am I addicted/what happens next?

&amp;#x200B;

I started using drugs at age 16. It started with binge drinking and MDMA (more likely meth cause I was young and dumb and never tested that shit), with a group of friends at EDM concerts. I got drunk and ended up taking LSD (which turned out to be 25I). After that drugs were a regular in my life. In college I took adderall to study weekly, maybe more, and binge drank every weekend. Cocaine became a regular weekend thing, and while I never bought it, there was no lack of people giving out free lines all weekend, every weekend. I started messing around with roxy's when they were available to me, a couple times a month maybe, and honestly fell in love with them, but they were not readily available. I am now 23. About 3-4 weeks ago I started taking oxy's by myself. I didn't want to share them, so my boyfriend whom I live with has no idea. I would take them as soon as I got home from work around 3:30 every day. I ran out and wasn't exactly sure who to ask for more, so last week I went through my parents medicine cabinet when they weren't home. I found 2 bottles of oxy's from a while back and took them.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always tended to get headaches later in the day (I'm a teacher and by then my patience is gone and the kids are loud). This week however, I have been getting pretty intense headaches around 2 o'clock, and am not sure if it is from the oxy's or not. I know I should quit while I'm ahead, but my only desire is to buy more. When I go to take another one, I can hear the voice in my head saying, ""no, don't do this."" but another voice is like, ""just one more time.""

Like yesterday I wouldn’t even talk because I thought my voice sounds gay. When I’m sober or on different drugs I go pretty well.

5367,Dissociatives,500 mg dxm hbr (+ 140 mg dxm hbr redose) ft. Dextroverse,"Good day r/Drugs! This is a trip report from a couple days ago which I wrote on my notebook transcribed. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**4th of January, 2019** 

*T+00:00* 

The time is 22:00. Dosed 500 mg of dextromethorphan hydrobromide. The method of administration is oral intake of 10 mg generic tablets. 

&amp;#x200B;

*T+00:24*

Feeling quite hyper. Very happy. I feel like I could hug stuff. Very positive. In a mood where I could love my enemies.

&amp;#x200B;

*T+00:34*

Dancing and enjoying music. Joji to Tyler, the Creator. It's quite beautiful. 

&amp;#x200B;

*T+01:43*

\[Writing has become noticably more messy from this point on\] 2nd or third plat now! Thinking of plans to go to outer space!

&amp;#x200B;

*T+04:00*

I redosed some time ago. \[140 mg\] Very thought provoking. Talking on VC. \[On the Dextroverse discord\] Fractals eyes closed. Serotonin awake not sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

*T+04:37*

Closed eye visuals are profound as they usually are. Terence Mckenna was sampled in one of the songs I listened to. Quite profound. Quite profound. \[Lol\]

&amp;#x200B;

*T+05:28*

\[Writing has gotten a bit better\] Been on discord all night and all morning with a revolving door cast. \[Going to censor screen names out of respect for privacy\] \*\*\*\*\*\*\*, or \*\*\*\*\*\*\* has been consistently there. We have randoms who jump in VC with shitty mics and we want to start a charity to get them better mics. \[This was a legitimate idea I had\] 

&amp;#x200B;

*T+06:02*

There's this weird individual \[As if I'm not a weirdo myself LOL.\] on voice chat with us on the dextroverse. His name is \*\*\*\*\*\*. For a good few hours his mic was a piece of shit \[I'm literally transcribing from my mid trip notes. Please excuse any profanity. The mic quality was bad.\] but at one point, he came through. So we're basically just hanging out with this guy who is plastered out of his fucking mind. \[Which I loved. Shout out to you if you're reading this. Thank you for staying on VC with us for all those hours even though we needed a translator every time for the first few hours. I enjoyed chilling with you.\] 

&amp;#x200B;

*T+13:09* 

Feeling quite positive post trip. I believe I reached upper 3rd plat lower 4th plat with my dose of 500 mg last night. No hangover. Mostly afterglow and positivity. Overall good trip with some peculiar happenings. 

\[I personally think that I wouldn't have been able to share the positive vibes I had gotten from my dose if I weren't in such a great community of like minded individuals (and sometimes unlike minded). I enjoy doing introspective and reflective trips on my own, but at the same time it's very therapeutic to jump on VC and socialize and chill for hours on dxm. Dxm has proven to me through my experiences that talking to people isn't as scary as I had let myself on to believe. I'm able to talk more openly to people and share my opinions and listen and empathize easier ever since I've started using dxm, and eventually I've found it easier to talk to people while sober.\]

I've recently discovered there's dmt juice for sale. Since the dmt is already diluted in the juice would it work?

I've heard [Yocan Evolve Plus](https://www.yocanvaporizer.com/products/yocan-evolve-plus) works pretty good, that I could pour the crystals in ecig juice and It would work perfectly. They're a bit pricey and Im not from USA so I can't get them through the official website. However I've seen a few cheaper on ebay that claimed they were a 1:1 clone.

I'm not very experienced with lsd and the most I've taken at once is 150 which barely hit me at all. 

We are also planning on smoking some weed because he had a backwoods wrap left over from NYE. I've heard the weed amplifies it like I would have taken 2 or 3 tabs which seems very intense for the dosage. 

If I do this how braindead will I be for how long afterwards? I can rest all day sunday but will I need more time to recover? Also what is the possibility of the trip going south? We are all very open and have a chill environment where we can tell anyone if it's becoming a bad trip and we will support eachother to bring them up. 

Does this seem like a good idea and a safe environment? Or is it too intense for someone as inexperienced with lsd as me?

5595,I :love: Drugs,Took a bunch of shit in one night; and it was amazing.,"It was amazing til next morning, and for the next 4 days. The thing is that I also drank half a liter of jaggermeister before. This happened during my 2nd elrow (techno party) in Barcelona.

&amp;#x200B;

The party started at 10AM and we left at 00:00, so about 14 hours of drinking and taking drugs. My main idea was to only take poppers that I brought and ecstasy that my friend was bringing (it was a fucking awesome ecstasy if u ask me - it was SoundCloud)

&amp;#x200B;

But then I got drunk, and that led me to take 0.2g (aprox) of crystal. That then led me to take half a pill of soundcloud (2hrs later I bought Audi and split it with a friend of the group) and then next thing I remember is the guards at the party taking my 2 bottles of poppers, after that its all blury til me taking a line of coke and speed back to back; then taking a pretty big sip of a class full of MDMA (my friend that had it told me he put 0.5g of mdma in there, so I presume I easily drank 0.1g of that shit.

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum up, I took 02.g of crystal, half a pill of SoundCloud and half a pill of Audi, 0.1g of MDMA, sniffed a fuck ton of poppers, and 1 line of speed back to back with a line of coke. And here am I right now as writing this, sipping on codeine with a bar of xanax.

5642,Methamphetamine,How meth turned me into a closet crossdressing porn addict. (A 10 years war story),"Tried Meth when I was 23, for the next 5 years only used a few times a year with what I would say were pretty normal meth highs. Then I started watching porn and jerking off when I did meth, then one day found the male Gspot, started using sex toys, cant remember the first time I decided to wear woman's clothing, but I can remember the first time I decided to put a dildo in my mouth and caught glimpse of myself in the mirror, it didn't look right to me for a man to have that in his mouth so that must have inspired me to make my self look like a woman when I was high. I've managed to have a few years sober a few times, but usually a few times every year, I would go on these meth, porn, cross dressing, binges which would last between 2 to 4 days. I felt so much shame after I would throw everything related out and swear never to do it again. And I believed I wouldn't. 
Usually doing other drugs and having a stressful life event would lead me to use meth again. After a few more years I started to become very paranoid, thought I was being followed and watched when I was high. This made the whole porn, meth binge very stressful and super dysfunctional. I would spend hours trying to cover holes where there might be cameras and then sometimes hear voices putting me down and threatening me. I had to take myself to the hospital a few times because it got so bad I couldn't function at all. Once I was watching a porn video and it said I was brainwashed into acting like a girl because I saw how much pleasure they were having and my brain started thinking that's something I should try. Recently I decided to tell some people because I have become so afraid people are coming to kill me when I get high. I don't want to die without anyone knowing why. After 10 years of this, I am still a straight male when sober. When I am high, I turn into a female porn star, that loves doing what they do, even though I maintain no attraction to men while high, I do like the sexual acts from a females POV. The pleasure I experience is just as equally matched and sometimes far outweighed by the mental and physical pain that goes with it. The shame is real, the fear is real and the more I look into it the more it seems the hate is real against people like myself. I wish it wasn't a part of my life it sucks. I'm going to get over it. Had a year clean and just had a relapse, now there people outside my room waiting to kill me. They will gone once I sleep, if history repeats. Yet still always think, ""this is it for real this time"". Moral of the story don't do meth and if you do, don't watch porn at the same time. Wouldn't want this to happen to anyone else ever.

However many people reccomended lsa by eating hawaiian baby woodrose or morning glory seeds. I read up on this stuff, it seems very appealing except the horrible nauseous feeling and the classic risks you can have with psychedelics. I didn't find much info on how this substance affects the brain, does it work like lsd or is there any difference? Also should I try to extract the lsa or just eat the seeds?
I'm really not sure if I should try it beacause it would be the first stronger drug I would try as I only have expirience with weed and alcohol.

The sadness lasted about 30 minutes then I went back to ""normal"", so I only felt the alcohol's effects.

I went to bed (10 hours after last dose) and slept for a few hours. I had no crash or any big comedown like everybody says it is. I am wondering why wasn't there any. I am quite sure it was meth because I really felt the effects everybody else describes and the source was good. Is it normal for the comedown to not occur? I am just really curious.

This was the first and the last time I've taken meth, so no need to discourage it to me from it.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ad06yn/no_meth_comedown/
5735,Alprazolam,Xanax Vs Alcohol for social events,"What are y’alls thoughts on just taking a moderate amount of Xanax instead of drinking at all for social events. I’m in college and was thinking If, hypothetically, I pop .5mg-1mg instead of drinking for social events that I would avoid a nasty hangover and the calories of alc. Would this be a practical strategy for social events once every week or two? What are the pros and cons of both speaking in terms of health, finance and anything else? Thanks.

5822,Cannabinoids,The feeling that I finally understand it all - do I though?,"Coming into the new year I was extremely stoned. I've been smoking since I was 14 years old (now 19), and I had an experience which I feel will forever change me.

I got to the level where I felt I understood it all. I understood that being alive was just a stream of consciousness I and we all experience. I questioned where the stream of consciousness came from, and questioned why it is there in the first place. I got deeper and deeper into this thinking pattern and had some mad conversations with my friends that were around. I understood that if I died right there and then, my stream of consciousness would be cut off from my physical self, but felt that I would still experience some form of consciousness in my non-physical self (if there is such a thing...).

I felt as though everyone around me knew what was going on in my brain, how I was thinking and what the future had in store for me. I felt I could understand every single thing anyone of my friends told me and also what was implied by it through micro-expressions and verbal cue's.

Thinking about it now I feel as though I ""lost the plot"" a bit. In the sense of maybe if there was a predetermined future for me, I stepped aside from the path that I was previously on and lost that particular ""plot"". And this lead me to feeling more alive than ever, because the world was now my oyster and I could be as positive as I wanted to be.

During this time of what I would probably refer to as psychosis or complete disconnect, all I was focussed on was wanting to change the world for the better, I wanted to give the world the love that it lacks, I wanted to make a positive impact and I knew and still know that I can because I'm a free person who lives in a developed country, who has a brilliant support system around them and I feel I'm determined. I'm blessed in so many ways that others around the world aren't, and I just want to work to getting to the top so I can spread positivity and allow the pain in people's hearts to be replaced with the love that my own can provide. I was determined to be Elon Musk's adviser also, and all of my friends told me they believed in me.

I was rambling on with some mad philosophical shit to my friends and they were being supportive with everything that I said. I was so content with just being. I concluded that that's all I can do - just ""be"". And while I was just ""being"" - I had complete control of my own thoughts and actions, and this gave me great comfort because this meant I could do my part to help humanity. Everything just seemed to add up to the exact moment that this all started to go down, and I felt I was late to the party on being this enlightened with life.

I've also stopped smoking cigarettes now, since that night. Although 2 days ago I smoked stalks and I feel like I hallucinated a man and a dog running across the road (I was outside), as two black shadow figures, and when I got closer, there was nothing actually there. The following day I smoked stalks again and I saw maybe a group of 6 people walking off into the distance (again black shadow like people). It was dark and I knew something wasn't quite right &amp; that it was my mind filling in the gaps. I didn't freak or get worried, it was a completely new experience to me (visual changes outside the use of psychedelics), and I thought ""wow, have I really done this to myself"", and just carried on walking.

I stayed up all night with a girl on New Year's after all my friends had left, and I found great comfort in knowing that she understood me and what I was going through. We watched TV and I felt like everything said on TV was somehow aimed at me, so I took great interest in every word spoken.

I'm not scared or worried while writing this, in fact I'm just more interested about what's going on and how I can best utilise my own brain to positively impact the world. This makes me wonder, can psychotic episodes render the subject more enlightened and useful, as opposed to confused and anxious?

Sorry about rambling it's just I wanted to get this written down somewhere. I'll probably get downvoted and ranted at. I'm more interested in what happens when I smoke weed next. Or maybe I'm just tired and am ranting on idk, I'm going to get some sleep.

5829,Stimulants,Mixing MDMA with Speed?,So I'm talking about mixing Molly pills with Speed. I have done this already once. First I snorted about 10 lines of speed of medium length and width and then swallowed a pill of about 200mg.When it hit me I felt extreme nausea and needed to take a shit. I wanted to get up from the couch to go take a shit but everything was spinning and I barely could move but at the same time I had so much energy. Eventually I got to the toilet with the help of my gf and proceeded to take a massive shit after which everything was fine and I had a blast for the rest of the night.

5878,Dissociatives,My First DXM Experience,"This occurred approximately 5 weeks ago and I wrote this the day after while still under the effects of a strong afterglow, I apologise if my style seems odd because of it.  

Around 6 pm I ingested approximately 900 mg of DXM, 300 of which was extended release formula . About 10 minutes in I felt quite nauseous and I was sure I would throw up.  I began eating bread, I didn’t throw up.  About 30 minutes in I started noticing... something, I couldn’t tell what and I remember remarking “what the fuck is this? I like it.”   At the hour mark I hopped up off the couch and started petitioning the gods (I’m not sure which ones) for some money, note that as I was doing this, I was asking it for me, as someone else, I kept gesturing over into the void when talking about “him”(me).  

At this point time got weird so I won’t bother trying to figure out when it all happened.  I laid back down as the trip came on heavy and at some point I was lost.  There was nothing around me except void.  Blackness in all directions.  In my head there were a billion voices giving me instruction so I began to build.  After an eternity of effort I had turned the void grey and built 3 balls in gradually increasing size.  The voices were unhappy but one drowned them out.  From somewhere out in the greyness I heard my own voice saying “breathe with me”.  I put my hands together and I waited, when I heard the breath I inhaled and from between my two hands a universe sparked, billowing endlessly, filling all corners of the void.  I awoke to myself, breathing deeply in an upright position.  

I spoke a lot to things that were not there.  I remembered my name but couldn’t remember how I had ever been who I once was.  While I tripped I was always aware of some massive, invisible cylindrical thing sliding past me, I decided that it was time and it was to be ignored.  There were very few visuals, occasionally everything became outlined in dim blue and red neon or I saw double or triple but mostly my eyes were useless, looking around gave me vertigo, seeing was far too fast.  For a long time I laid on the couch talking to different pieces of myself, or dead people, or people who have yet to come.  I don’t know who they were but there was an endless stream and they all wanted a chance to inhabit my body, just for a moment.  Man, woman, child, all races and creeds.  I experienced them all.  

 I blacked out again.  I was commanded to do odd things, like drink an old pot of coffee I had brewed hours ago.  I stood and stretched, marvelled in the mirror at the complexity of my own eye it was an odd circus of events.  Eventually I went back to the couch, exhausted I closed my eyes and found I could go anywhere and do anything.  I spent an overlong amount of time reliving past memories that weren’t mine. Spent time with those who are dead, loved those who do not love me, and relived some of the greatest moments of many people’s lives.  Eventually I was found by something that cared where I had gone.  I don’t know what it was but it heaved me from my indulgences and carried me in its arms.  My hand trailed below and I created vast amounts of life wherever it struck while I was carried.   The creatures I created worshipped me and I laughed at them as fools. I was back in my body.  Nameless.  Ageless.  Clueless.  Very few of the voices remained and of them, few were interested in me.  I became painfully aware of how slow time was moving.  I stared at the wall for a lifetime and when I picked up my drink it was still cold.  I couldn’t comprehend videos.  Games were far too complex.  I was left to wait.  And I did.  I felt generations pass before I finally drifted into dreamless sleep. 

I have done very high doses of LSD, psilocybin, DMT, marijuana, cocaine, MDMA, hydrocodone, and many more.  In all my life I have never experienced anything like DXM.  I’ve felt ego death but I’ve never had my ego ripped from me and replaced by a billion others.  It was an experience that will stay with me for a long time.

Me and my friends had been hitting his dab cart with a wire plugged into the wall (dangerous and stupid). I had taken around a ten second hit at the outlet with the wire then held it in my lungs. I almost always do this when hitting a dab pen, whether or not I need to be discreet. Anyways, after I held the hit in my lungs, I ran to the couch and told my friend to move over frantically. I remember him moving over and that is it. My friends that were there told me I fell backwards onto my head and arm. Once I hit the ground, It’s said I was just shaking for around 20 seconds. My friend tried calling my name and I still didn’t snap out of it. Eventually I remember coming to sitting on the ground hearing my friends yelling at me. It was scary as shit but I went and took another hit right after. After that time, the weird weightless shaking part does come back from time to time while holding in a hit, but I can eventually make it stop. I know the only foolproof way to make this never happen again is to not smoke/use dab pens but that’s not what I’m here for.

so in June, I took a some MDMA at a music festival. Ended up taking a little too much and got this weird sensation. My hands were extremely clammy and I felt somewhat weird mentally; out of body experience-esque (felt out of it in a way too). I didn't like the feeling and had started to panic (I'm an anxious person as it is).

So 3 months later I went to another music festival and was only drunk: zero drugs at all. I was at diplo and was dancing like crazy, then I got the same sensation in a way. Super clammy hands and felt really out of it. I calmed down and felt better.

Tonight, I was sitting around studying completely sober and randomly, I got the exact same feeling of clammy hands and feeling really out of it/out of body experience-ish. 30 minutes went by and I felt better.

Just curious but has anyone ever dealt with something like this before? maybe it doesn't relate to the MDMA i took in june, but that was the first time I experienced it. maybe i was just about to pass out? (never have passed out)

6216,Psychedelics,Shrooms Trip (2.5g) - how shrooms changed my life,"Hey guys, I just wanted to share my first ever experience with shrooms! I've tried LSD 2 times, pretty familiar with it. I decided to hit up my dealer and get 5g of shrooms. My friend and I ate about 2.5g of shrooms each. I remember trying to forcefully feed my friend because it tasted nasty and he couldn't do it., but me on the other hand, it didn't bother me at all. They kinda tasted like dirt. Anyways, here's what happened throughout the course of my trip:

4:00pm: We both eat the shrooms and decide to go to his house, its about a 30 minute walk, so we were hoping the shrooms would somewhat hit us while we were walking. 

4:30pm:  We arrive at his house, I start to feel the shrooms, it just put a smile on a face right away, I just couldn't stop smiling, same for my friend. We don't see any visuals yet, or experience anything yet at this point, we only feel the happiness.

5:00pm: At this point, me and my friend were starting to kinda feel it, I look in the mirror and my pupils are HUGE! With LSD they were kinda big, but shrooms made the entire pupil cover my eye, stuff is crazy. Anyways we continue to wait for the shrooms to kick in.

5:30pm: At this point, me and my friend start to feel it a lot, it hit us hard at this point. We start to make funny faces and each other and just say random ass shit, and I would just continue to laugh my ass off. I thought being high while laughing is fun, but shrooms is a different story. It's like your letting your happiness out that has been trapped inside of you for a very long time, and then all of a sudden, BOOM! We start to see some visuals such as drifting and morphing, but it was very light visuals.

6:15pm: And here we go, me and my friend are fully tripping. We couldn't believe that we took shrooms, we started to babble on about how shrooms are from a ""different planet"" and that aliens sent this gift to us. As crazy as that sounds, I fully believed it on shrooms, I just kept thinking more and more about it and started to convince myself in my head. I see a lot of visuals, such as drifting, morphing, and I would space out a lot and see these geometry patterns on the wall. It blew my mind. The best part about it though is the euphoria, I just couldn't stop smiling, even if I tried so hard to not smile, I just couldn't. I always had a smile on my face, and it was blissful. Probably the happiest times in my life to be honest.

7:20pm: My friend and I are still tripping, and we would always randomly yell out, ""Holy shit bro I'm tripping nutsack right now!"" The visuals are still pretty heavy, and I start to think a lot, like A LOT. My thoughts were going at a million miles per second, everything I saw I would completely be interested in it, and just think about its purpose and why it's made. 

8:00pm: At this point, my friend and I bring out the weed, and smoke a gram of it in one sitting. All I have to say is, wow. Weed really boosts the trip a lot more, it's almost like I'm experiencing the peek again. After we smoked the weed, I started to head home because it was getting late. And that's where the trip turns around. 

8:30pm: I finally got home, and I'm still tripping. I start to feel this doom upon me, anxious thoughts are starting to swarm my head, I start to think about all the bad things I did in the past. As I'm sitting there my heart just dropped in fear, my mood instantly changed from being happy, to sad. I think about my grandma who has passed a while ago, like 5 years ago. Tears just starting to come out of my eyes because I started to remember everything I've done with her, and I missed that. I start to full on cry for like 5 minutes. Once I stopped crying, I felt better, it's like I released all the energy out of me that has been keeping me from doing all this stuff. When I was on shrooms I started to think about all the better things I could do with my life, instead of drugs, because at the time, I was in love with drugs, I would take xanax, smoke weed like 2 to 3 times a day, take DXM pills, and smoke cigarettes. Shrooms really made me see on why I'm such a piece of shit. I'm missing out on life, all these opportunities to do with my life, and all I was doing was drugs.

10:00pm: After a long hard thinking session, the thoughts starting to go away and I feel happy again, I start to listen to music which made me even more happy. Visuals are still there, but it's starting to come down a little bit.  

12:00am: At this point, I don't really feel it as much anymore. I don't see that much visuals, and I don't really feel it anymore. I started to think about what happened during it, and focused more on becoming a better person instead of being a druggy all the time. I really wanted to become better, because doing drugs is good once in a while in moderation, but not everyday. And surprise surprise, I just thought about that, keeping everything in moderation.  

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you guys enjoyed this story, please leave any feedback surrounding this post, I'd appreciate it. It's been about a week since I've done the shrooms, and I've been better than ever. I stopped doing pills, stopped smoking cigerettes and kept my use of marijuana moderate. Shrooms really helped me, and I do not regret taking them. If any of you are interested in trying it, I'd highly recommend if you have any experience with other drugs such as LSD. But always remember, you gotta be in the right mindset to take em, otherwise all that thought you've put into it will be wasted, that's what I think at least. I hope you all have a great rest of your day :)  

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: Throughout the entirety of this trip, I was high the entire time on weed, so it kinda made it a lot more intense than it should've been ;)

6248,Psychedelics,Feeling anxious/disconnected 5 weeks after shrooms?,"So I’ve done shrooms before and it was great it gave me a more positive outlook on life and just felt slightly better but nothing really changed in me, about 6 months  my friend suggested doing it again, I didn’t really want to but didn’t really mind so tripped with him, the trip was good but the shrooms were stronger (still I didn’t trip balls/no major visuals) it’s been about 5 weeks and I still feel funny, just really in my own head/anxious and disconnected from reality, I’ve had problems with anxiety before and it’s really activated it and now I just spend my whole time thinking about/getting anxious about when it will pass, I’m getting really freaked out and am unsure what I should do? I’m not even sure if it’s really the shroom after effect or it just reactivated my anxiety from when I was younger and that’s made me feel disconnected, I’m having trouble concentrating and feel less like my normal talkative self and it fucking sucks. Do I just need to work on getting my brain back into its previous thinking pattern (which I find really hard to do when my anxiety is just saying it’s not me but the shrooms and my thoughts seem harder to control now) or Is there anything I can do? I feel like I’ve just wasted the last 5 weeks and have just been floating around, which is really surprising since the first experience I had not even a week of feeling really weird. Anyone with similar experiences? At times I feel like I’m on the verge of a panic attack but then quickly quell it, my thoughts go really quickly. I’m really missing my old self (but do note I have had obsessions before about feeling different suddenly when I was younger but at least then I could tell myself it’s just in my head), will this effect just slowly wear off?

I don't know how to fix this. Rehab is useless...I'll go back to using it as soon as I'm out. And NA is not something I feel comfortable with.

6349,Cocaine,"My friend doesn't feel Coke, Ketamine or MDMA?","Hey peeps, I just created a throwaway to ask some questions here. 

M is one of my favourite drugs and I wanted to share the experience with one of my friends at a large trippy themed house party. He felt nothing, a few months later he tried again and felt nothing again. I recently gave him some coke and he also felt nothing. I tried giving him some Ketamine at a new years party and still it did nothing for him. The amount of K i gave him throughout the night should have K-holed him for sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

He sees how much I love M and constantly talks to me about how it sucks that it doesn't give him any euphoria or even stimmy effects. Does anyone have suggestions on what I can do to help him be more sensitive to any of these drugs?

6373,Stimulants,"Goodbye, cocaine","So I've been using cocaine on and off for the past six months. Not a lot of time compared to some users, but despite this it has done significant damage to my life. I'm in community college, and I had to drop my classes last quarter due to this fucking drug. 

I should've learned then and there that I can't handle this substance, but the addiction had already set in. I continued using, and my weight suffered because of this. I've been skinny my whole life, but cocaine erased any appetite I had, and thus my weight dropped. But did I stop? No.

This brings me to tonight. After railing lines today and yesterday I started to become super itchy all over my body. I didn't think anything of it at first, but as the night continued it grew worse and worse until I finally noticed I had hives all over my body. After this discovery I decided I'm fucking done with coke. I can't be spending loads of money on something that completely eats up my soul anymore, I want more out of life than this.

6421,Cannabinoids,Going to hell on a weed trip not once but twice.,"So, this has happened twice to me and only with a certain group of friends and I’ll tell both experiences here at once. Sorry for the long read but it’s worth it. Thank you.

I’ve smoked a few times but I’m not a regular smoker and often enjoy being moderately high. I know enough about weed to understand that it can be mildly psychedelic and mind altering. To be know I am strongly agnostic and don’t have any religious ties except for people trying to get me to go to church.

The first time was a little over a year ago and I’d smoked like twice before but never a lot and had good experiences both times. It was New Year’s Day and I wanted to start off the year right and my stoner friends invited me to smoke with them. my parents are very lenient with where I go and what I do but tell me to not do drugs while I live under their roof. I went to his house and did the normal stuff, we went and got some pretty dank stuff from a reliable guy and started to roll in the car and smoked in a shed outside my friends house, I’ll call this friend mayo. He smokes a lot and I was comfortable enough with him to smoke with him. He sparks it up and takes really large hits. Me acting like I knew what I was doing took a puff puff pass and they were not big hits by any means. The tingle in my nose and throat immediately hit and I get the pre-effects of being high so I believed in for a good time. We play some Red Hot Chili Peppers, which I know very well, and the blunt comes back to me and I repeat the step I took before and pass and say that’s enough for me. My other friend, I’ll call cam, left to go get water out of the truck and we were just standing with the blunt almost finished talking. Mayo finishes the blunt alone and we just stand there not really talking. I start to feel increasingly high and honestly start to lose recollections of what comes after in my physical state. I start taking a trip of all of my childhood memories that I had done stuff wrong and start to pay no attention to my surroundings and what’s around me. It was beginning of January and very cold but my body felt like it was on fire. In the middle of reliving all of my memories cam had came back and said they were going in. I snapped out of it for a minute and realized I’d been walking in circles for the last ten minutes. We go in to mayos house which everyone is dead asleep and they start to play video games while I just sit on the bed kind of slumped down. At this time I got short term memory tracers that were on a loop with my bad behavior memories. My body was still incredibly hot and I stripped down to my shirt and pants. I would only have tracers of cam and mayo asking me if I was okay and what was wrong but my brain would fill in blanks as if I was talking to them but words weren’t coming out of my mouth. They started asking me if I knew where I was and I didn’t have an answer. Soon they gave me an answer and that I was in hell. At this time more memories started to loop and this time it was when I could’ve made good decisions and made my way toward Christ and the Christian religion but decided not to. I am not religious so I was really freaking out in my head. They continued to tell me I was in hell and thoughts started running through my head. Words of a prayer I’ve never said before started coming to mind immediately like I’d said them every day. At this point the heat was centered in my body like the feeling of burning from the inside out. I confessed out loud to them that I was in hell. I said the prayer out loud to them and after I said the prayer everything got better. It’s like everything stopped all at once and I had peace. I felt like sleep was the only thing I needed and went straight to sleep. I woke up feeling a little hungover not really knowing if that was normal because I was new to this. I didn’t say anything to mayo and cam the next morning and got up and went home and didn’t listen to any music the entire ride home. I didn’t smoke for another almost three months after that experience out of terror. 

After that experience I started smoking again, still not regularly. I went on spring break with a close friend and smoked the entire week and didn’t have a single bad trip. I thought it was just a bad experience. I started experiencing dejavu very frequently the next few months after the incident like I’d already lived my entire life. It was scary but I brushed it off. I experienced dejavu heavily every time I smoked after that but I just assumed it was normal. 

Right around Christmas my friends that have gone off to college invited me to smoke and I complied because I hadn’t smoked in a while and haven’t seen them in what seemed like forever. I had a good experience surprisingly and went home and had a good ass sleep. A few days before New Years the same friends that I smoked with last year hit me up to smoke again like we did last year. I hadn’t had a bad experience in almost a year and had became more comfortable with weed and how to handle it. It was like midnight when we got around to smoking and we’re all 17 and 18 and in my state you have to be 19 to buy tobacco products so we couldn’t get ahold of any papers or rillos. They had a gb (gravity bong for those who aren’t familiar) and I’d never hit one before. They said they had good weed, which they always did. They said it was Girl Scout cookies and I really didn’t doubt. So mayo was drawing the gb for everyone and my friend who I’ll call drew was with us this time. Drew was up first bc he’s the one that bought it. It was a milky bottle and I was a little intimidated because he didn’t even cough after holding it in for a good 30 seconds. Mayo drew him one next and did the same. He packed the socket once again for me. I was nervous and drew was already saying how he was high. I knew the concept of a gb and how to hit it. The bottle was milky again and I hit it like a champ. I held it in and exhaled without coughing like a champ. I had some water on deck and immediately killed half the bottle. It hit me fast and I went and propped on my car. I sat there and realized what was happening and I regretted ever hitting the gb. My memories started to trace back to when I was young and I was frozen on my car for a good 5 mins. Cam and drew told me I should sit in cams truck and they cranked it and played music but got antsy and hit another gb each with mayo. Mayo came after his second and sat by me in the back seat. I remember him kept hitting me with the back of his hand on my arm to get my attention but I knew he wasn’t really making any action towards me. Cam and drew got out to hit another gb while mayo stayed in the car. He finally said something to me as I felt my body get warm. He asked me if I knew where I was and as I didn’t reply he replied hell. My body instantly got as warm as laying under a 100 pound wool blanket. I couldn’t move or think. I looked over and mayo wasn’t even in the car. He was w cam and drew hitting more gbs. The thought of dread crept over me and that my life had ended once again. I relived all the terrible memories I had ever witnessed once again and the burning sensation got worse. They all got in the car and just sat listening to music. I was convinced I was in hell once again. They all got ready to go to cams house and I was going back to my own. I was not okay to drive but I did it anyways. I gathered all of my senses left in me and stumbled my way to my car. I sat there for another 20 minutes with no music with the cold air on blast. I put my car in reverse and backed up so ever carefully. I only had a 5-10 minute drive home and I knew I could make it. As I was driving I would go forward in time to see what I would do next and then snap back to reality a minute up the road from where I was. I finally made it home and stumbled to my door. I closed and locked the door behind me and went to my room and stripped all of my clothes. I laid in bed for a minute with all the lights off and the feeling of puke hit me. I rushed to the bathroom and puked my guts out. I went back to my room and slept peacefully after that. The next morning I felt the feeling of hangover once again and just laid in bed the entire next day. 

I’m sorry for the long story but it is the truth and whole truth and I haven’t ever told anyone of my close friends. I’m scared about what is going to happen honestly and what people will think. You guys are more of experts than I am and I hope you made it this far. Please give me your input on what happened to me.

6497,Pregabalin,Lyrica withdrawal psychosis?,"Hi, please can anyone help me. I live in an extremely conservative country with tight drug laws, and they've just restricted sale of Lyrica. I was prescribed pregabalin for nerve damage and fibromyalgia, but I'm also an addict, and quickly began chasing a high and slowly increasing my dose over the last year. I'm at about 150-225mg a day. I can't talk to the prescribing doctor about this because, weird drug laws and weird country I'm in. I felt like I was OK because I've seen doses of like, 600mg.

I quit about a week ago, cold Turkey. I feel positively crazy. The first few days just a deep, soul consuming depression that was annoying, but manageable. Now, racing thoughts, a deep dread, intense anxiety and intense paranoia -- I've never felt paranoid before, but this is a legit paranoia where it feels like my husband is out to get me, to turn me crazy. (Not that he needs help, I'm there already) I have suicidal ideations, and I'm scared I'm gonna end up in a psych ward or worse, in jail. I feel like my husband is going to put me there! I really feel like he is..

Anyway, any one have experience with this mental breakdown type feeling with lyrica? Is it a glutamate storm? Am I just now crazy, is it going to last forever, is there anything I can do to help me cope?

I have about 5 75mg capsules left, and unlimited access to baclofen (somehow it's not illegal here?) How can I use these to their best benefit?

So I figured, I’d take one and see how I felt then go from there. I’m a pretty anxious person and have Ativan as a prescription, but I don’t even take those often either. It’s probably been 3 months since I’ve even touched my bottle of Ativan (good ol’ CBD oil sort of eliminated my need for it)

Y’all, within 15 minutes I felt it. I felt great. I figured I’d take the second one right about then. But as I was walking toward the kitchen, the floor seemed to swoop up toward my face and I almost fell flat over. I don’t like my head feeling like that, so I just walked to the nearest bed to sit- which happens to be my 2 year old son’s Paw Patrol bed (he was with his grandma for the night). I sat on the bed. Laid down. And I was out. I slept there from 7:30 pm until 9:30 am today. IN A TODDLER SIZE BED I slept for over 12 hours solid. My friend was up until 1:30 in the morning, she took two of them, said she felt great and enjoyed her night a ton.

Needless to say i dont want to repeat this experience so what other drugs will have this effect (best to look mainly at codeine bc with xtc its not so bad and seems to be connected to the heart as well). I know I shouldn't take benzos, anything else? Does ambien count as a benzo too?

6773,Cannabis,Why does weed give me this philosophical anxiety?,"Its not exactly depersonalisation; I don't really know how to describe it, but its like everytime I smoke enough weed to get 'high' I get really anxious about the universe and my perception (being alive, being able to see, worried that one day my vision will shut off, worried about what being alive means, worried about what if i forget who i am, worried about not being normal, worried about going insane and losing my mind, worried about being worried) I get this HD vision on weed where everything seems the same but way clearer and a bit more foreign. 


I'm already a really anxious person in general and i haven't smoked weed in over 3 weeks but watching things like black mirrors bandersnatch can trigger some sort of derealisation where i get freaked out over the state of being alive and existential philosophical questions about 'why are we here' and 'what is a person' however, I feel completely normal but i can get panic attacks on weed about feelign like i'm 'holding on to the corner of the earth almost gonna fall down off the plane of the earth'. In fact, even just typing this all out has given me some anxiety. Even just being in certain lighting in my house makes me feel a little bit derealisation-y and then sometimes i'm perfectly fine. 



I realise I have virtually no tolerance everytime I try to smoke weed so everyitme I smoke enough to get 'high' I get this anxious annoying questioning high but its like even the act of just getting high itself makes me anxious and then if I ever do try to feel relaxed from getting high I get anxious at the *thought* of not being anxious. WTF? why can't I just relax? how do I turn my thoughts off and relax? how do I stop questioning my consciousness and reality like most people on the planet and just enjoy the present? Should I just smoke high CBD strains? I've tried vaping CBD but I don't really feel anything. 



I'm in Canada btw where shit is super potent and legal. maybe weed is just too psychoactive and I need a low thc high cbd strain? idk. Its like I wish I could enjoy it and stop being so anxious but it just makes my thinking and anxiety worse.

6863,Long Post,The weird and wonderful world of Alprazolam,"I should start out by saying that this is my first ever post to Reddit. Should it be in the wrong place or violate any rules and regulations please feel free to remove it. I just want a tiny insight in to how and why my brain is reacting so strangely to this drug. 

A tiny background on me is that im a university student who has suffered and still does suffer from severe mental health problems which are still undiagnosed. I'm a very anxious person with fairly little confidence especially when it comes to direct contact with people. I can be very lazy and unmotivated the majority of the time especially when it comes to uni work. I have a history of being abused but thats all Ill say on that. On the whole i'm quite messed up, but aren't we all a little bit? 

Anyway on to topic. The first ever drug I took to relieve anxiety and stress (other than weed which is still quite debatable) was Valium. However being really stupid and uneducated on any drug, I decided to drink alcohol on it for the pure intention of getting wasted. It worked. I was around 20 at the time and just entering the world of drugs. The only real ones i'd done prior to this was Cannabis, MDMA and Cocaine and i'd never really considered taking drugs for the better of me. More just to numb and bad thoughts and memories... along with getting mangled. 

Fast forward a year and I move on to xanax. Again I abuse it, dont treat it with respect and as im sure everyone knows that when you mix two downers together it really doesn't end well. The first and only time I went on a self harm rampage was after binge drinking on xanax, to which most of my left arm paid the price. 

So whats different now? So about a year and a half ago (im now 23 by the way) I found a spare xanax lying around in an old bedroom draw. I specifically remember it being a brand that I've never seen again. It had 'Mylan A4' on it and was round split in too quaters. I hadn't been drinking, smoking or doing any other drugs that day. It was quite late so I took half of this pill and fell to sleep about half hour later. 

The next morning everything changed. I woke up a bit sluggish but the moment I stepped out of bed everything seemed to become clear. I started to put my mind to stuff. Do chores that i'd never usually do. Speak, hear and write in ways i'd never done before. I even become a tiny bit OCD however i'm not complaining as i'm a very messy person. 

An example is that I was in a lot of debt to payday loan companys (around 10). In that very morning I rang them all up and explained my situation and set up a regular payment plan with every single one! Bare in mind what I said earlier about my communication and anxiety when it comes to talking to people. 

Id clean my entire room, go to work and put in the shift of a lifetime. I could speak to customers so elegantly and freely. My university work now became interesting and fun. I could feel senses become better, for example my sense of smell became amazing, as well as my taste. My appetite (which has always been awful) suddenly changed and I could finish meal upon meal. Its almost solely the reason why I now like so many different foods. Just to sum it up I guess it made me feel how I should be feeling all the time. 

So whats my issue here? Firstly id say that other than weed and cigarettes I am not addicted to anything. I am currently on my 3rd lot of self prescribing xanax. The first time after my initial experience, the second time around 6 months later when I could feel things getting bad again, and the third now. The first and second times were for around 2 weeks, however this time its been slightly longer (around 3 weeks) as the christmas period always brings me down. Im now taking 2mg bars however im down to my last one and I dont plan on getting anymore for at least 6 months. I am more than aware of how addictive this stuff can be, and why. But, the difference is it feels like being i'm being roped in to something so positive. That makes me productive, friendly and happy. No other drug has done that for me. 

A little brief description on my legal prescriptions include about 15 different anti depressents and I know its the same for so many others. The reason I stopped going to the doctors was because of their lack of care. Thats not to say that they're all the same and I understand how difficult and stressful their job is, but they really didn't help. I had CBT, regular therapy and a few other things. Again nothing really helped. 

Anyway, xanax made me so confident that I even went to the doctors to tell them what I was doing and how I was doing it. I didn't go there asking for them to perscribe me it, I just wanted to know why something I randomly stumbled across worked a million times better than anything they've ever given me. Of course they told me to stop taking them straight away, they're dangerous without a prescription blah blah blah. Like I get it, as soon as I started feeling good I researched this stuff and tried to understand how it worked. Again I know its addictive, I knkw how to handle it and I know when to stop. 

The problem now is I want to feel like this all the time. Again im not addicted and I can feel my tolerance now increasing significantly. I just still dont completley understand how it works, and 'Behaving With Excessive Cheerfulness And Activity' which describes me perfectly is still considered a very rare side effect from taking xanax. 

The real question I want to ask, and I know theres probably no straight forward answer but why do they make me feel like this? Im now sensible enough that I dont drink, smoke or mix anything with them. iv'e learnt that lesson. But Xanax seems to have a huge cliche of making people tired, sleepy and relaxed. It has a lot of hype around addiction and im sure most of us know about how rappers in the US  are glorifying it. But to me it really doesnt do what it says on the tin. I wake up with more energy than ever. Im just really confused as to what happens to my brain after I take it. 

A couple more sidenotes. Firstly these are REAL xanax. No they aren't pesribed but they are real. Thats all I can assure you. Secondly I take 1mg 30 minutes before im ready to sleep. I wake up around 9am. Take a quarter (0.5mg) around 12pm and another quater later in the day around 6pm. I take a larger dose before I sleep as it really does make all the difference to how well I sleep. 

So please if you have any questions, feel ive missed anything out or just have some general information I might have missed. Please reply. If i'm being a complete idiot then tell me. Doctors wont give me a word of advice on the matter so im just looking for any kind of information. 

Thanks.

6872,Long Post,Pest Control Terrorists,"Strange music filled the room where I was reclined. A sample on repeat played while my friends laughed at inside jokes. All of a sudden everything was wrong in the office where I sat alert and upright. 
~~~~~~~~

I gasp as I bolt up right in my bed, my back is full of hot knives stabbing directly above my right hip. I look to my left as I reel in agony. My girlfriend lays there curled up against the wall wrapped in her special thick beige blanket she claimed as hers the first night I we slept in my apartment. Ah love, warm and beautiful, through heavy rose glasses. But the knives stabbing my back with every wincing movement drop me quickly back to reality. My bones ache as pain antagonizes the opiate receptors in my mind. My entire body retaliates against this day as it does every day. I get to bathroom to do my daily shit, shave, get ready routine. Brushing my teeth my joints crack like dry branches, I look around while I get ready for work. The room is a disaster the bed has a fitted sheet and two separate blanket lumps, there are clothes everywhere in ""dirty, mixed, and cleanish piles"" as my girlfriend calls them. But the bathroom is the worst, a clearly shut in bachelor look comprises the area. The sink and mirror looks like a drug addict tried to organize porrly. Eye drops, drops of blood, small pill chunks and other paraphernalia cover the whiped down half of the vanity and mirror. The other half has two toobrushes, toothpaste, hair gel and deodorant spread about. ""maybe I'll clean after work"" I say softly to myself. Before I leave the room I kiss Brooke and softly whisper ""I love you"". She is an incredibly sound sleeper, I know she my kiss and words are not registered by her body but I hope her spirit feels me. though I had never felt comfort from hers.
~~~~~~~~~

My work is a soul sucking place that, takes any hope of easy days and destroys them by your supposed lunch break. I drive with my roommate, best friend, and occasional boss Adin. My once four thousand dollar 2001 beige sedan blasted Fight For Your Right by the Beastie Boys. We rapped along as we sped around in second gear to warm the engine. Adin was in a good mood, as our boss was always gone on Thursdays. He got up on time plus we were stopped in the drive through at Starbucks waiting on four huge, triple espresso, white chocolate, complicated, coffees. Adin pulled a half burnt bowl of good crystallized weed out of the glovebox, and was finishing pulling an expertly cornered hit when I yelled at him for not cracking his window first. He winced as he blew a cloud of unmistakable marijuana out of his opening window. I cracked my window, took the lighter and took a large hit of the still green part of the bowl. Not bothering to corner at all I kept filling my lungs with thick smoke. I finish my hit handed the cherried bowl to Adin as I took deep a breath in as my lungs swelled. I held it in for 10 seconds staring at him and then released a massive plume of smoke from my window ""pussy..."" I say at the end of my breath.
Adin scoffs ""whatever, nice corner dude"".
""it was all for you"" I retort hitting my 2mg nicotine vape to quell the cough I have bruing in my throat. We get two more hits in each before we get to the window, money and goods are exchanged and coffee is obtained. [Every transaction could be a drug transaction if the laws were different], my very high brain wonders about this and tries to convey this idea to Adin. He is sucked into his coffee and pushing the last black bits of resin a burnt weed into the  bowl. After 2 lefts he hits it and coughs passing it, I choke on my hit and fight to focus while driving these two lane roads. We roll in to work late as usual, but the owner Travis wasn't here so today we didn't give a fuck.

I kept work shirts at the office, I mostly just took a new one every day from the boxes Travis hid from us. I took one and put it with my route of services in my truck, I never wore a work shirt under my warm clothes in the morning but  changed in the afternoon. I put on my bug killing baseball hat, that was probably as soaked in pesticides as the Wal-Mart brand boots I kept there too. As I got ready for my shitty cold day I looked around the office there was a small shitty futon where Lucas my other best friend was tying his boot, then Travis' office pleasantly empty, then the actual office. The office is where Adin and Val worked, he planned routes, she did reschedules, and most importantly both answered the phones. Adin and Val were the only reason I had not been fired. It was winter and after a hot, humid, and miserable summer the cold snap finally happened. It had snowed and the bugs all hid for the winter, pest control in the winter is really just putting out ant bait and looking busy. I hardly did any of my real job, I filled my pesticide tanks but never used it all in one day like I should haveand drove recklessly in my little stick shift Ford work truck. But I got away with everything because of them. Everyone hated Travis for one reason or another and that bound us all. Together as the Vietcong of The Best pest control we sabotaged routes for rainy days, covered for one another's lateness or hangover, sharing weed, alcohol, and prescriptions all under Travis' nose. Today everyone was relaxed because everyone knew we would be alone. Adin and I were already high and had coffee for everyone. Lucas supplied us with an amazing little pill called Concerta, eagerly we took two each with our coffee. Val wasn't a fan of a lifestyle on uppers or stoned she sometimes would indulge with us, but more than anything she stuck to a crinkled plastic water bottle full of Malibu, Bacardi, or boxed wine. I come over to her desk and sneak a look in her bag, nestled next to her lunch was her water bottle ""nice..."" I think to myself. I talk to Val about whatever was going on with her or the next party she and Adin had planned in the house with my name on the lease. Val, Adin, Lucas, and I could talk for hours but at 8:00 a full hour after we showed up Nathan and I left for our routes and the office hummed to life with ""thank you for calling The Best how can I help you?"" and fake apologies.
~~~~~~~~

The rush of dopamine, norepinephrine, nicotine, THC, CBD, and lots of caffeine, from my morning drug cocktail carried me far into the day. It was noon when I felt anxiety begin to creep in, I felt my frozen wet feet and the sticky sweat of working for 15 minutes in the cold and then getting in a warm car repeatedly. I hated this job the work wasn't difficult but the conditions sucked. In the summer it was hot, humid, long days that left your clothes soaked in a vile mix of sweat and pesticides. In the winter it was bitter cold, the rainwater and morning dew soaked your boots, and a cold wind cut through every layer of clothes and skin to chill your bones. At 2:00 I had just finished my route of spraying paralytics and other neurotoxins all around suckers homes. I was still sane, which was always a good sign, and at least I didn't have to explain that to get rid of ants you have to sweep regularly to an Indian woman today like Lucas did... 

As I came back to the office to drop off the truck, paperwork, boots and everything else I left there, I saw a dreaded scene. To everyone else it was a normal busines parking but, thanks to my habit of memorizing cars, I knew that a single little red compact car meant at least talking to Travis. So I  walk in with my headphones which was a poorly observed no no, but It  allowed me to ignore the unmistakable sound of Travis's ""Hey J"". As I put my things away and take my headphones out, I pretend to care about Travis's life and why he is here on his day off. After a few minutes that felt like an eternity Val looked at me while she was on the phone. Usually she would take pleasure seeing everyone else stuck in conversation with Travis, but today she was as peeved as I was about him showing up. To give herself and me a break she put a call on hold and yelled to Travis that he had a call, I give her a look of thanks. Travis picks up and I escape quickly to Adin and Val's office. I ask her about the usual bullshit happening today and leaned back in Adins chair until he came in and demanded his chair back. Before leaving I asked who was coming over though it never mattered. Our apartment was more or less a getaway house for our friends to escape to, we were never alone, but it was home.

Back home I shed like a snake from my door to my shower. Waiting on the water to get warm was always long enough for me to crush up a peice of Xanax, wrap it in a joint paper, and swallow it down. ""there goes my anxiety"" I say to myself as I find a half smoked bowl from Brookes morning routine. We would leave each other bits of drugs as notes that whispered ""I love you"" as we burnt and ate them. I pick up the blue bubbler, hit it twice and grab the only towel I own from the floor. One last rip from the bowl, I hold it in, as I slip into the showers warm embrace. Slowly exhaling through the smoke I whisper ""and there goes my sanity"". My shower playlist plays Where Is My Mind and the day rinses down the drain as my soul rises above...

6899,Cocaine,Coffee is different after trying cocaine,"So, tried cocaine a few times. Not a lot, just a few lines on different occasions. I think it was alright, but far from as good as some people claim it to be.   
However, after trying it i have noticed that i find the effect of caffeine on my brain more rewarding. Earlier i was primarily drinking it not to be tired or because of the taste, but now i am way more aware of the stimulating effect it has on my brain which feels kinda like a very subtle version of cocaine. 

Did anyone experience this too or had similar experiences? I heard that a lot of people think weed is different after psychs tho.

6964,Long Post,MDMA/ ecstasy abuse and why you should not toy with it,"\[Long post\]

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, i'm not looking for any compassion or judgement from your guys, i'm fully aware of my actions and the consequences that are right now extremely visible and, eventually, I will try to walk you through step-by-step on how I got to this point and why I have decided to take a long break before even using it again.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started in  the beginning of 2017, when I regained my interest in trying ecstasy (I previously had an experience with 1/4 of a pill, but it didn't actually quite have any effects other than energy and a bit of euphoria). I live in Romania, where electronic ""underground"" music scene is pretty much fucked up at this point (somewhat similar to UK's), every week or so there's a party for e-tards who basically fried their brains out. I'm one of them, more or less.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to 2017, it was around June when I went to a minimal-house party with some friends, somewhere in the woods and from that night I knew that this is not going to end well, but I kept my hopes up that I won't end up like one of those. I split a pill with a friend of mine that night, started to feel the come-up and for the first time in my life I have been feeling great and danced the night of from 1 AM to 9-10 AM, got tired, fell asleep, woke up at 11 and danced a little bit more and left at 12PM. throughout the night I smoked maybe 7-9 joints, rn I don't recall much of what happened other than that. Overall I felt really great, the next day no comedown, had a little bit of afterglow and that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to July, there were 2 separate times I took. The first one was half a pill, then came a festival after \~2 weeks, 5 nights. I smoked some weed there and had like maybe 1pill and a quarter in all the 5 nights so I was feeling pretty ok. Then came August, I had half of a pill on another party, but didn't feel like shit and all the comedowns that were explained on reddit. Keep in mind that I read all the instructions in regards to usage, min. 3 months distance from one another, keeping hydrated, bought MGs, but i know i didn't respect the 3 months rule. I think somewhere in October was the first time when I felt somewhat of a comedown. There was a 2 days festival out of city, the first time when I actually felt that I have exaggerated (2-3 pills I think overall, some MD, speed and 3-4 joints). I came back exhausted, but my mood wasn't severely affected. I remember it was quite an ok period, I just got a new job, just hooked up with my now ex-gf and moved out of my parents house. It went all ok. The next time when I took it, was at my friend's b-day, I got hold of some pure MD in a club and we split \~o.8g in 3 ppl. After that night, i started to feel somewhat of a comedown, became aware that my mood started to swing, but not that hard. Just a minor depression, but though I should mention I've been depressed somewhat moderate since I was 19-20 y/o.

&amp;#x200B;

The last two times when I used x was on Christmas and NYE, but each time only half. In that period I got into some fights with my gf, started to become jealous, been stressed at work and didn't quite have a good time of my life. We broke up around feb-march 2018 and though I know the breakup wasn't the trigger of what's going to happen next, I do consider that the event was somewhat contributing to my addiction of mdma and weed. The biggest problem with myself is that despite the fact that i know how much damage i'm doing on myself, I just keep doing it.  Starting from march till the end of 2018, I think it all went gradually, I started to use almost every month, once or twice between march and may, then almost once every week, with some distances here or there when there weren't parties. The bad thing is I started to use from half a pill to 1 or 1 and a half per party. Then came July again, where I went to that festival again and I could already feel the difference between how I felt in the previous year and in that moment. I've bought for myself and some friends overall 10 pills for 5 nights, i had 5 they split 2.5 each and \~ 10g of weed for all of us who were there. When we got back from the festival, I had an extreme case of apathy, anxiety and the night when we got back to our homes, I tried to sleep but had some sleep paralysis due to lack of rest, serotonin and energy.  Unfortunately I do hang out with a lot of friends who are doing drugs and this is what I would call a downward spiral into where I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to September, there was an opening party in a club which I would define crucial for all these drug fused parties that I had attended. In the night before, I went to another party and think I have snorted 7 lines of speed and went to work after 3 hrs of sleep, so you could imagine how fked I was, mentally. Back to the party, we went there at around 1 AM and throughout the night I think I had 2 pills and a quarter and 2 joints, by 7 AM I started hallucinating from MDA and weed. I know, I'm fucking stupid, but my tolerance was way up high and I already knew that i'm going to get fucked. We left the party and a friend of mine called a cab and left me nearby my home. Before we left home from the party, we smoked the second joint in hopes of coming down smooth, though my mind was flying, I couldn't concentrate and felt like I was out of myself. On my way home I started to feel an unease, like there was an impending doom and that some negative presence was always following me. When I got into my ap, I barely changed my clothes and got into bed in hopes that I would fall asleep quickly. Well, I was so wrong, that's when my mind started to panic, I realized that was still very high and like my thoughts, I could see them, they were all moving simultaneously and I couldn't control them. I called my friend, told him that I fried half of my brain and thought that I will be like that till the rest of my life. I honestly thought that I will never be normal again, couldn't move properly, think, go to work, see my friends and family because I fried my brain. I was thinking about calling an ambulance and or jumping out the window, but somewhere deep inside my brain I knew it was the drugs doing this to me and got onto reddit and started to read about bad trips and how to calm myself down (thx reddit). After 2 hrs or so I fell asleep. I was never before after that night, and I knew that, I think something snapped in me, and weed just contributed in that mental breakdown. I stayed away from mdma 2 months, didn't touch it until november and I thought maybe these two months would be the last ones. So yes, I did it again, two or 3 times and one separate times on NYE. I realized afterwards that after that night, weed made me anxious and feeling unease. On NYE night, again, after weed I had a brief episode of 1 1/2 hrs of derealization when we were going back to a friend's of ours.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what did I get after doping myself with 100-110 pills throughout 1 and a half year? Severe mood swings, bad tempered, a psychotic breakdown, depression, apathy, lost interest in almost everything that presented a slightest interest in my life, a very bad long and short term memory, anxiety, my focus is all over the place, my intellect has worsen gradually. Was it worth it? No. Did it teach me a lesson? Most certainly, yes. Some other thing I should mention is that I had been abused verbally and physically since I was young, due to my origin, i’m not european. I grew up as an adolescent, teen who even though had friends and people around, couldn't quite get emotionally attached to them or couldn't from meaningful relationships with people, but I do have close friends that did this with me and noticed the changes in me, as well, and trying to help me get through this. Also, I have a highly addictive personality, and my coping mechanisms are really not that good. I was addicted to gambling, lost a lot of money, addicted to meaningless sex, addicted to alcohol (still drinking almost every day). Despite all of that, people that don't know me that well, would consider me a normal guy, who's quite sociable and takes life somewhat as a joke. I still have a normal full time job, attending a master's degree and going to gym, going out with friends and all that. But then again, I don't think I felt natural happiness since 2016, moreover not in the last 365 days, basically my serotonin receptors are fucked. I know it will be a long road from now on and that I have to stay clean from mdma and even weed, maybe a year or so will pass by until I will start to feel a little bit more normal, but surely it will require much more than that for me to be able to feel myself again. And now I am taking baby steps, trying to eat healthy, going to gym, read, keeping my mind busy in a way that would help it reconstruct itself again.

This was not a pity story nor do I want you, guys, to judge my actions. I know what I did, I was fully aware what I was going to do/ have done to my mind and body, I just needed to get this off my mind and, hopefully, help some other folks who are going through something similar or about to get into this special, but dangerous drug (which should be used with cautious). Trust me, you don't want to lose that euphoric, energetic, empathetic, chit-chatting and lovable feeling when you're high on molly. Instead, if you abuse it, all that you'll get are the long term effects that I have described up there, and while high on it, you're just going to be brain-dead zombie, that enjoys music, but doesn't feel that specific magical feeling of it. Take care of yourselves, and your bodies

6974,Long Post,A Home...,"""Well I'm from California I moved here about 6 months ago in January"" I said clearly. I sat upright with my chest puffed to seem confidant in the small entry area of The Best Pest Control. Travis the owner sat across from me in his office chair asking me questions on my background as part of my interview to be a ""The Best Pest Control Technician"". I already knew I had the position, small mom and pop business like this need to replace someone fast when they leave otherwise work backs up and they go under. But I had another advantage, I was raised Mormon and went to church most sundays. Travis was a good Mormon father and hired the office manager Tayler from his old congregation. The Mormon connection, as cheesy as it is, came through for me. After Travis decided I must be a good person, I am a Mormon after all, we shook hands and I started Monday.
***************

This was how I came to meet and live with Adin. Adin was the office assistant, he did anything he was told by Travis and Taylor. I had seen him at church a couple times, clean cut, well styled hair, he looked like a good young man. Though looks were deceiving Adin enjoyed getting high, partying, and drinking, he wore the mask. His secret reflected mine, I also dabbled in debauchery. I had been a regular at the Bullpin, pounding four dollar pints of Red Oak between turns playing pool with Jacob and Lucas, every Thursday for 4 months now. Most Saturdays when I told my parents that I was out with my Mormon friends I was at parties. I had friends at work from the ""ghetto"" city next to ours where I stuck out from everyone with my California style. Flip flops, jeans, a tank top, and perfectly styled hair, that was my statement every summer night since I had moved. But in the ""ghetto"" crowd I was the only white guy at parties, drinking Reds, and finding the stoners and druggies. Hoping to trade decent beer for a hit or two of whatever they had. I tested Adin casually by mentioning getting drunk and stoned at a party. He wasn't fazed, and spoke about getting stoned out of earshot of everyone else. Soon Adin, Lucas, and I were all partying.

This was exactly the opposite of the intentions I had when I first landed across the nation from all my old problems. I moved here with a tentative verbal agreement with my parents. The agreement was I got to live there for one year, paying 200 dollars a month, if I stayed clean of drugs and went to church every Sunday. As simple as that. I was already past every minute withdrawal from the alcohol and smoking an ounce a week, when I stepped off the plane. So why was I on the roof of a beer garden downtown ""sobering up"" with Lucas? I pondered this briefly, staring at a vile wheat IPA Lucas picked that sat in front of me. Lucas had bummed a single cigarette from some girls on the street, lifting it from him was a bit of a dick move, 'eh,we're best friends'. Lucas was droning on about how drunk he was, trying to think of how to get us back to his parents. He scheemed as I lit the cigarette and pulled in a lungfull of tar, nicotine, and sweet MAOI's. Mmmmmmmm...... That's why people do this, I hit it again and handed it to him. He accepts it, not even noticing I stole it, I shrug and chug down half of my disgusting drink. 

""Fuck, we're fucked"" Lucas exhaled.

""Dude I was already fucked, I have to move in a month"" I said monotone and hopeless. ""My parents said I could stay till January, then I'm on my own for good"" I pounded the last of the beer and took the cigarette back.

Lucas looked at me shocked I hadn't mentioned this to him earlier. Though quickly his face changed to mischief. Mischief and fun were what Lucas was best at, always pushing shots, double strength drinks, always trying to make every night amazing. Slowly he took back the last of the cigarette and said ""You know Adin has been looking to move out, plus he's the office manager now...""
********

On Saturday Adin wanted some weed and I had a dealer, from my Algebra 102 class. Allen was chill, he sold weed so he and his girlfriend could smoke for free and that's all he wanted. He was nice and even had Brooke and I over for a movie night once. He wasn't looking for new clients but we were algebra friends, so I bought Adin along. We bought a quarter and they seemed to get along. It was a smooth transaction, in the car Adin packed his orange spoon and I divided the bag. We smoked on our way to take Adin back to his dad's truck. Adin looked at me as we turned on to the freeway ""we should be roommates"" he said. I laughed as I hit the bowl steering with my knee ""sure"" I said. It started as a stoned joke but after one mostly sober talk, 2 apartment visits, and some paperwork, Adin and I were roommates. 

We uses his dad's truck to get beds and move our four boxes of stuff. My mom found us four couches on Facebook and lamps came from Goodwill. It was bare bones bachelor living. Travis loaned us his projector and we proped it up on my longboard, it was gigantic on the wall. Adin supplied an XBOX and my grandma stocked our kitchen with cups and plates. We had heat, light, beds, and drugs. Lucas and his girlfriend set up the Wi-Fi while we were gone,  electromagnetic radiation broadcast out ""BrosB4Hoes"" from the living room, classy... 

We loved it, we had total freedom and we used it liberally. We threw a Spartan party the very first night we were there, Everclear lemonade flowed and weed smoke bellowed from the back porch with a loveseat on it. What would become my core group of friends sat there playing Red, Purple, Black. To my left was Lucas and his loving girlfriend Mira, as Kelsey. I had known Kelsey for a long time through church, and Brooke liked her. Adin and his new office assistant Val sat across from me, and leaning on me was my girlfriend Brooke. We laughed, got very drunk, and had a blast. In the end Val and Adin slept in his room and Brooke and I went in mine. From then on everyone came over just to blow off steam, it was a home and haven for us and our friends. We never had a dull night in our house.

 Brooke was 18 she was young and impressionable but, she had a will of iron and made things happen. I needed this because I had never had such adult responsibilities and was intimidated. That was not why we were together though., she cast a beautiful spell 
over me, we loved each other intensely, we had fought for it and won, we were invincible. I drowned into her beauty, 5'4"", Blonde shoulderblade length hair curled framing her fair round face, sea blue eyes, perfect Nordic beauty. An hour later she lay on my chest, I always synchronized my breathing to hers. She melted into blissfull sleep, carefully I reached to my right and hoped I had a roach on the table. My fingers found a
 crutch, paydirt, I put it in my mouth with my right hand and the grab a lighter. I look at it, about a centimeter of weed is visible.

'good enough'

I lit it expertly while stroking Brookes back to keep her asleep. Three hits later I taste paper and I chrush out the crutch on the nightstand. Rolling to the left I faced Brooke our legs intertwine. I tried to study her face, memorizing every curve and dimple. For the last week whenever I closed my eyes for bed I saw a silhouette of a girl. I had wracked my brain time and again but nobody I knew could match the silhouette, and it most definitely wasn't Brooke. I close my eyes and there she was again like the ghost of Christmas future. She sat staring at me, waiting for the minutes on her lilac mermaid timer to reach zero. I am paralyzed as the figure walks to me, she slowly strokes my face, ""turn before the cannons"" she whispered and smirked.

I was released as my eyes snapped open to the same curves I was memorizing, staring back at my shocked face. I gingerly got out of bed sweating and went to the very top shelf in the bathroom, quietly I pulled out a small bag of Xanax bars and broke half off. Expertly put the rest back, not hidden, just placed where Brooke couldn't see. I slid back to Brookes side and curled up to her. I don't remember closing my eyes again that night...",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ad8kpp/a_home/

7032,Psychedelics,First time candy flipping after 2 days of meth.,"So this story takes place just this last week. It started new years eve at 12:30. Me and the friend I would be candy flipping with begin to smoke meth. This is my first time trying meth but not his. Anyway I won't get into the meth to much ill mostly be focusing on the candy flipping. Just remember that prior to candy flipping we were up for 2 days straight doing meth.

So fast forward two days and me, my homie who we will call tyler and 2 other people get some fire ass acid and mdma. Me and my friend I was smoking meth with took 300 ug of acid and 180 mg of MDMA 2 hours after. Before the MDMA kicks in shit isn't very out of the normal, we're just enjoying the fuck out of our trip cause it was some good acid. But then the molly kicks in. Shortly after I started feeling it tyler says ""I'm a musical genius"" gets his guitar from across the room and smashes it into the wall as hard as he can. That's the start of it all, the matrix point. He starts pacing in and outside of the front door muttering mostly people's names and things like ""there is no outside there is no outside"" that goes on for a few minutes then we all go into the living room and sit on the couch. At this point tyler gets up and throws a lighter against the window behind us as hard as he can. This wakes his dad up. When his dad walks out of his room and asks what is going on he responds saying his dad's girlfriend died. So he comes down stairs and he wants answers as to what his son was on, so we told him. After that we kinda have to calm him down so he doesn't break anytging else so I just start cuddling on the floor with him in pure bliss while my other friend is talking to their dad. But eventually tyler gets up and knocks a ladder down that was right next to us and it makes the loudest crashing sound. His dad comes storming down freaking out like usual cause he's back at it again breaking shit. Mind you this entire time ever since the guitar he hasn't said a sentence that anyone could understand. Completely incoherent. So after maybe 10 minutes the two other people with me dip and it's just me, Tyler and his dad. Me and his dad try to get him outside cause we wanna start a fire in the backyard and maybe he'll enjoy the fire ya know. Well not possible. It took at least 10 minutes to get him outside and when we tried to give him a cigarette and a torch to light it, he tried to light his own hair on fire. After that he wanders inside back by the couch and we all sit there in the living room with him continuing to say things such as ""trevor trevor noah where's noah LeBron James LeBron James RATATOSKER"" pretty funny shit. His dad then puts up one of those big Christmas laser lights u put on your house outside. I'm liking it a lot it looks very very fucked up and good. Tyler though, not so much. He gets up and just yeets it across the room. Hahaha it was so funny but his dad was not having it, he yelled at him some more but I'm not sure much got through to him. We try to get him to drink something but fail at that and eventually he grabs the thermis and throws it at his dad saying ""hey rob!!"" As hard as he can barely missing him. That was the breaking point, his dad said he's going to jail if he breaks anything else. But that didn't really stop him, so I had to constantly be on the look out for when he wants to break something so he wouldn't go to jail. Later in the night his friend Robert comes over to calm him down and instantly Robert's presence calms him down a notch or two. Over the course of an hour he slowly learns how to function and talk again like a normal human being and then Robert leaves and we chill on the bed and doze off.

I couldve gone into a lot more detail but it's already a fuckng massive story. There's the jist of it though. If you have any questions ask me in the comments. Shit was the craziest drug experience I've ever had and we both learned a lot from it.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ad93tj/first_time_candy_flipping_after_2_days_of_meth/
7037,LSD,acid a big risk for dealing with a cancer diagnosis?,"my mum got diagnosed with cancer a month ago and it hasnt been easy so far

the only couple of times i’ve done acid were only positive trips - one of them being after a bit of a bad experience in my life. Sorry if this seems a bit stupid to ask (im not in a great state of mind right now) but would it be a terrible idea to have a low-dosage trip to maybe take some of the stress? 

if not what other drugs would be reccommended? i have access to ketamine, ecstasy, weed, alcohol.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ad94dl/acid_a_big_risk_for_dealing_with_a_cancer/
7091,Dissociatives,First DXM trip,"This was not only my first dxm trip, but my first trip ever. I figured it was a good start because it was easy to get and didn't seem like a lot could go wrong. I made sure to do my research beforehand, to get the right amount and avoid anything with other active ingredients. I took 530mg and then waited for it to take hold.


As expected, I don't think I ever hit the 2nd plateau, I'm pretty sure I just had a pretty decent length on the first. It took about an hour and 15 minutes until I noticed something that I can only describe as ""HD senses"". I noticed because I picked up a candle and was about to light it, and it smelled so much more complex than ever before. I then looked at my blinds in my room and they seemed very sharp and detailed. 


I sat down at my computer and turned on some CS Source. Then the only bad part happened, where I got really itchy all over my torso for some reason, and got red from scratching but it subsided after about 25 minutes. Somehow I totally forgot about CSS and just sat in my chair thinking about stuff. 


When I finally decided to stand up, I felt very wobbly so I just laid down in my bed and started giggling like a middle school girl. I went to the bathroom to run cold water over my hands, not to wash them, but it just felt nice. I probably looked like a psychopath if anyone were to see me. 


After that point I was pretty much on the come down, so I laid back in bed and called my friend. I told him about how i was doing and said ""I'm not sure that my left arm is mine"", it felt kinda like a Mr Potato Head arm and someone swapped it out. 


I rode out the last of it listening to some EDEN for about another hour and a half then at 7:30 made some scrambled eggs and started out a window.


A pretty good trip, I'll wait a month probably and then try a higher dose. Before that sometime I'm gonna try LSA as well.

7250,Stimulants,me being a dumb fuck and not understanding how much Adderall to take?,"so i got Adderall XR 30mg from a friend’s script because i was stressing about school and shit, I only take it to help with school and it’s been about 3 months since I last took one (i only take them according to testing/exam schedule so like, couple weeks apart. imo i don’t think they would be any good for recreational use anyways). So a year ago idk if i played myself by starting with the extended release at 30mg and only ever taking that dose since then. I took one last night because tests are coming up and hoooo did that help a lot. Everything went pretty okay, got no sleep since i took it sort of late but i’m cool with that lol. I’m currently on the comedown, cried for a hot minute bec i got sad but i’m good. Trying to eat to keep my blood sugar leveled. 

looking back on it, i probably should’ve opened the capsule and only taken like half of it? I’m 4’10” and 95lbs and didn’t really think about the dosage until now (bad move, ik). Not sure if this matters but i’ve had experience with benzos and opioids with no problems (probably because i took them at the right fuckin dosages).  But anyways every time i get take a whole XR 30mg I get super rapid heart rate, in addition to sweatiness and dry mouth (which ik are typical, not so sure about the fast heart rate though).  Also this might be a dumb question but is it okay for me to take half of a 30mg XR capsule in like, two or so weeks? I saw a lot of varied information as i read some stuff about reverse tolerance and dopamine sensitivity??? i feel kind of stupid for not understanding what they mean. Any advice/input is appreciated, thank you !

7363,Psychedelics,My first LSD trip,"So from what I remember I was 18 and I had some friends telling me about LSD and how amazing it was. I did a lot of research prior. I got really curious and found out that my closest friend was a regular user and I talked to him and he got us some tabs. We met up with this guy at a McDonald's I asked him if it was real and well ofc he was selling us drugs ofc they were ""real"". 

We got back to my friends house he was home alone at the time and we lived across the street from eachother so I felt comfortable if I felt the need to be at home. We took a tab each. At the time I had this disgusting taste of ink in my mouth, at the time I thought it was the Blotter paper. Ended up figuring out after the trip it was fake. 

But about a half hour later I was on my friends bed and I felt my entire body get goosebumps, and this sudden urge to take a shit. So I told my friend I was going to take a shit. I ran in and pulled my pants down. And as soon as I finished I knew it was there. I stood up pants down and I remember my friend knocking on the door he was asking if I was okay i said yeah.[ I guess I was in the bathroom for a whole] but I was so focused on trying to wipe my ass. Making sure i dont accidentally put my fingers in my ass. 

I got over the obstical and I found myself looking into the mirror. I focused on the pupils of my eyes they seemed like they were stretching and the bags under my eyes getting lower and lower. I snapped out of it went to my friends room. He seemed calm he was lighting up a blunt and we sat down listening to goodbye horses. After the blunt that ink taste I got in my mouth never subsided. I drank some water but it tasted like I was drinking chemicals. 

After a little bit I felt like walking around the block it was a really nice day and my visuals were at their peak. It felt as if I had a tiny box of perfect 20/20 vision while my blind spots were filled with  Kaleidoscope vision. We walk past this alley and we hear some grunting. Across the street were homeless guys beating the shit out of each other. We sat and watched. My friend asked me ""should we do something"" and I looked back and at him and said ""nah"" the last moment before we turned away I could see the guy who was on top elbow the man and blood just flying off his face. We kept walking but as I walked it felt as if I was running but I wasnt. Things were going really fast. We turned the corner and I saw a bike rack and I told me friend ""bro we got to park the fucking car"" and he kept looking at me confused. I remember leaning over and grabbing the bike rack and saying ""dude these fucking metal bars are smooth as fuck"" 

After the walk I felt like going home. It was about 3 hours into the trip at this point. It was around midnight and I didn't want my family to worry. So I went home and layed down on my bed and turned on the office. As I start watching the show I started to feel as if the show was talking to me. I started panicking a little and I turned off the TV. I started to think about life and my belief that everything is fabricated and everything around me isnt real. The people I know and see are not real. I found myself in a deep hole of reality. I didn't know how to feel. I felt really lost but at the same time at peace knowing that I was going to be fine after this is all over. My friend messaged me and I got on my computer. We got into skype and started playing some league of legends. My friend sent me super chill music to listen to. It was really hard to actually know what I was doing after an hour or so I ended up turning off my game and listening to music for the rest of the night. I did learn a lot from the trip but not as much I felt like I could've.

7375,Cannabis,I tried weed for the second time and tripped balls.,"Edit: it was cali kush and I watched the guy rolling it in front of me. My brother didn't trip and he was smoking the same stuff as me. He was just freaking out because he thought I was dying or something lol.

I've always wanted to try weed in a safe environment and a few days ago, my brother and I smoked it together at home. I felt slightly dizzy for a few seconds and then nothing. A dud maybe? So, decided to try it again today...

It felt like I had a thick fluffy border between my entire body and the outside world. I couldn't feel the things I was touching with and my hands were moving too slowly. 

Then it felt like I had part of this huge circle in my head and I was stuck between an infinite amount of realities, but deep down I was trying to get back to this reality. Almost like I was on a tv show watching myself. I had no self awareness or control at all. I described it as ""going into the bubble"" like I was disassociating. 

I was terrified at first, but it gradually got better, nicer and calmer. I'd sometimes slip back into the bubble but not as intensely.

This is the strangest, most surreal experience I've ever had. I don't know whether I'd every want to try weed again. I don't have a clue what this all means. I don't think I would've survived if I didn't have my brother with me. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Anybody have any thoughts or insights that might help me make sense of this evening? ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/adbkj6/i_tried_weed_for_the_second_time_and_tripped_balls/
7378,Cannabis,DXM trip eliminated weed sleep dependancy maybe,"So the backstory here is that I have been using weed for sleep for around a year and I literally can't usually sleep without it. The last time I tried to, I was up until 5am then passed out for 2 hours and woke back up feeling not rested at all. It takes me multiple days usually to overcome this and start sleeping like a normal human again.

I tripped off dxm Friday night/Saturday morning. It took a second plateau dose of 375mg had an anxious trip and didn't think too much of it. Saturday night however I was sitting with the family around 7pm and dozing off in the middle of whatever we we're doing which is incredibly unusual. I can generally stay up almost indefinitely until I consume some cannabis and immediately fall asleep. 930 or so Saturday night I decided since i felt tired already, I'd try to sleep without using weed, which generally gives me horrible anxiety about not being able to fall asleep. The anxiety didn't manifest itself at all, and I fell asleep within probably 15 minutes of laying down. I usually sleep about 7-8 hours before waking up but I slept 10 hours straight and woke up feeling pretty refreshed. I went to church today (Sunday) then came home and passed out for a 3 hour nap, again without any cannabis. I'm going to try falling asleep tonight again without weed. I will update
 
If anyone else has had any similar experiences or any feedback I'd love to hear it. 

Tldr: took dxm and have been able to sleep without weed, which is something I haven't been able to do for almost a year

Update: I went to bed at 1030 hoping I'd be asleep quickly, 2am came around and I was still awake so I hit my vape a couple times and fell asleep pretty quickly after that. It seems like dxm will give you two nights of sleep without weed, the sleep immediately after your trip ends, and the following night. Possibly more if you don't have an anxiety disorder that also contributes to keeping you awake 🤷‍♂️",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/adblhh/dxm_trip_eliminated_weed_sleep_dependancy_maybe/
7383,Cannabis,Does anyone else feel like smoking weed makes them more sociable and able to make conversation more naturally?,"I browse drug forums from time to time and I see many posts about how people only like to smoke alone or with a couple other people as it increases their anxiety and makes them antisocial. I’ve been a regular user for about a year, smoking most nights, at least while I’m away at college/university, and while it can do these things to me (mainly during the first hour while the High can be overwhelming), at the same time I feel like I am able to relax, enjoy myself and just live in the moment. I used to be very antisocial and paranoid about what people would think about me when stoned but now I have the mindset of “I’m enjoying being high, if anyone has a problem with that I don’t give a fuck” which I feel helps a lot. 

I can also feel myself being better at holding conversations: much more naturally flowing and less awkward (such as small talk which I hate doing sober). does anyone get this?

&amp;#x200B;

For those who make, and even for the others that don't, we must give it a name. This can be a really stupid post if this is already used and commonly known. I'll take the shot anyways

In chemistry you have various types of groups that represent organic coumpouds. Two of them are acids and alcohols.

And there's a third group that's called the ""Esters"", which are formed by an acid bonded to an alcohol. This bond is usually called ""Ester Bond"".

Taken out of organic chemistry context and putting it in Drugs context, an Ester is basically the result from taking acid and alcohol together, forming unique effects.

7693,Stimulants,"amazing addy trip, worst comedown I’ve ever had, and now some fun sleep deprivation hallucinations!","tl;dr: took sone good ol’ adderall, felt amazing, my whole face got swollen from me being a tweak, felt like shit, got sent home from work, have been up for 40 hours continuously as of right now and saw some crazy rainbow looking teddy bear dancing on my ceiling from probably hallucinating from sleep deprivation lol


alright so yesterday I woke up 8am around 10-1030am popped 60mg XR (usually I take 1x30 to the nose and 1x30 orally like ten minutes later, so first time taking 60 orally, and I usually take at like 7pm) and I was on my merry way.
Come up felt amazing, because I’m used to the one up my nose kicking in really intense then a gradual come up 15-30 min later from the one I popped, so this was nice. 

Felt AMAZING. sometimes when I snort one/pop one it is WAYYYY too strong at first, the drip is so sweet it makes me nauseous, and I overall just feel like shit, but like the usain bolt of feeling like shit

Went to work, was in an amazing mood (whuxh was dope because I’ve been feeling like absolute shit for weeks), got so much shit done at work, felt really good about how quick/good I did at work. Came home with my best friend around 9:30pm-ish. Didn’t start the comedown yet, but definitely was slowing down. Around 1am, adderall has completely “leveled out” with my adhd (don’t have a  comedown starting yet, but I don’t “feel” it). I take some hits off a dab pen and I do that so I could sleep. Then I chewed and chewed and chewed on my cheeks without realizing (when I woke up my mouth and sheets were so swollen I looked like I ate a frog 🙃)

I didn’t sleep (go figure). Try to sleep again around 12pm-3pm (had to work at 4pm-11pm). No success. Comedown starts to hit around 3. Comedown hits harder than any other one I’ve ever experienced EVER because instead of the one I would usually snort wearing off like 5hours later, they both wore off at the same time. So I get to work at 4, Got sent home around 5:15 for looking like shit ( didn’t mind about hours, I was tired as fuck). Realize I didn’t eat. Chow down on a McDouble. 

Literally 10 minutes pass I perk right up comedown over yay!! God bless big greasy burgers for comedowns. 

Then here’s the weird part. 

I’m looking at my ceiling (it has almost a marbled pattern) and I see the outline of a teddy bear and then all of the marbled lines started just moving like getting bigger then smaller then I started seeing like weird colors and shit on the teddy bear stomach and then it just started dancing. And it’s weird because it doesn’t look fake I know it’s fake but my eyes are just seeing it move but it’s not?? Weird. Should probably take that as a sign to go the fuck to bed. (Yes I do know adderall isn’t some acid/shroom type hallucinogenic/psychedelic shit, and I’m not tryna claim the hallucinations are from addy directly lol, I looked into it, probably just sleep deprivation. 

So yeah, this post is just kinda a trip report because this was the first time I ever tried taking 60mg both orally. Gotta love addy even tho my ceiling is swirling around from sleep deprivation and my cheeks are so swollen from biting them I look like I have a toad in my mouth.

i began to befriend older, drug fascinated people who had told me that the xanax i was prescribed could be used to get high. 14 year old me was excited by the idea and i began taking a pill out of the little box every day and hoarding them, until i had enough to get high.

i didn’t know it, but this was the start of my extremely difficult battle with benzos, more on that later. it was around here that i started smoking weed too actually.

so about two months after first using xans to get high, i was staying home from school just to do it. my parents were pretty dismissive and put it down to depression, but, i’d just wake up and take some xanax and go back to sleep. i’d just stay in bed all day, not even knowing what day it was.

it got serious here, and i was skipping outings to stay in bed and float out of consciousness. i became physically and mentally dependent on the xans. this is where the odd twitching and shit also came into play, and i didn’t know it but this was the start of physical dependence.

i had no fucking idea what i was doing, and i had no idea how badly it would fuck me up long term.

fast forward to january 2019 and i’ve done most common drugs, mostly once or twice. lsd, 2cb, addy, pot, ritalin, kpins, valium, prozac, nitrous, dxm, a lot of shrooms and a lot of alcohol. probably some more in there i can’t remember.

i’ve essentially missed two years of my teenage years due to xanax, and it’s been awful. benzo withdrawal, for me, was hell itself.  seizures and psychotic episodes, constant panic attacks etc etc. fucking horrific man

i also had a minor rehab stint in may 2018, and am due to have one again in less than a month even though i’ve been tapering off of benzos for 4 months now

the worst part is, i didn’t even know what i was getting into and now my GABA receptors and my whole brain in general is fucked beyond repair. and i essentially lost those two teenage years as they just flashed before my eyes, lost to addiction. and i didn’t even notice.

and i’ll never get them back.

**so if you’re looking to try drugs for the first time for whatever reason, i urge you to be responsible about it.**

**please make sure you know what you’re doing, you usually don’t realize you have an addiction until you’re neck deep in it.**

i don’t really care if nobody sees this but i just had to express my feelings towards “am i old enough to try ____?” posts

thank u for coming to my ted talk

7783,Psychedelics,Bad trips?,"So I’ve done LSD, LSA, and golden teacher shrooms. Until recently my trips have always been fun and relaxed. In August I bought a half ounce of shrooms and I accidentally ate half of them. I only wanted to eat about 3 grams and I had no way to weigh it so I tried to eye it (big mistake) once I finished chowing down I noticed how much I ate and decided to buckle up for the ride. The trip was bad. Absolutely horrible. It was also my first bad trip. 

(Trip report I guess?)
So I decided to play guitar during the start but once the come up really got noticeable I felt really anxious. I turned off the lights and laid down. I turned on workaholics (the peyote episode) and watched that for awhile But as I neared my peak I started to panic. I have pretty long hair and it was all I could thing about. I kept thinking that I lost all of my hair even though I was touching it and massaging my scalp. Not long after I tried talking to some friends so that I could chill out but I couldn’t understand language. Nothing made sense and I felt extremely confused.  Eventually a friend called me and I got stuck in a thought loop where I didn’t know what time it was. My friend says that I asked him what the time was over and over again for about 20 minutes when he had to hang up. That was near the peak but during the come down I was able to contain my thoughts and relax.

(The real question I need help with)
Since then I’ve tripped twice, once by myself and the other time with my friend (it was his first time tripping) and both were horrible. I want to trip again because I think it can help me out with some decisions I need to make in my life but I do not want a bad trip.

  I sent him the code, which was my big mistake because I gave them 40 dollars. I wasn't sketched until they asked for 25 more dollars for ""cop insurance"" and in that moment I knew for sure I had been scammed.
  That's when I reverse image searched the pic he sent me and it was pulled from a website. I suppose it could have been worse, I could have given the 25 dollars for the ""cop insurance"" or he could have been a cop himself so I'm not too beaten up over it, but it still sucks nonetheless.

7843,Opioids,My favorite thing about doing dope.," I liked smoking heroin out the foil and meth out the quag. I enjoyed the mix because I would think of nothing, everything was funny to me. I would stay up for days laugh my ass off, nodd off hard and crack hella dope fiend jokes with the homies.

 I liked meth first because it just made me take action, it turned my world into a grand theft auto video game. I was just putting in work to put in work. I thought putting in work was a game! Straight turned into a fucked up person.

Later on, I started to enjoy heroin because I was annoyed by everybody's bullshit. I enjoyed coming home at 2 am and lighting up the foil to nodd off in the dark on the couch with no TV on. 

When I was in a bad mood coming down I was a vicous cold motherfucker. It was like my soul and my eyes were focused and dark. It felt like my eyes had no soul and I would just say the most ruthless shit without blinking.

I'm sober for a month now and I'm getting my shit together. I've been working out daily and shit eating good. I was turning into a dark motherfucker, I went from a healthy dude with a great job, to carrying a gun.

I was supperrr super lucky that I didn't end up in prison. I got the fuck out of that lifestyle when I started to see everyone who was around me was going to jail. I bought a plane ticket and got the fuck out cold turkey. 

I do miss the streets I'm not going to lie. I hate it and I love it. I hate the scumbags who are in it, the days you're broke and trying to find a safe place to just CHILL AND RELAX without INTERRUPTIONS. you feel me LMAO... 

I love the social part, just kicking it meeting good people who just liked to get high. The high, and the lifestyle.

8136,Psychedelics,Kundalini Moving/Awakening on LSD,"
I know there is some disagreement on this subject among the community(at large, idk about here on reddit) but I believe I experienced a Kundalini awakening on LSD several years ago. I know some of you probably believe that the involvement of any psychedelics invalidates the experience(hopefully not here on r/Drugs) or disqualifies it from being a kundalini awakening, but frankly I’m not interested in arguing it. Why?

Our perception is the result of a constant cocktail of pituitary chemicals, ingested additives(even from the daily diet), light exposure, and other phenomenon which would traditionally be described as physical that undeniably effect the consciousness profoundly. My point being that know known mode of human experience can be described without drugs, i.e; substances that alter your consciousness. Similarly, our conscious can control these chemicals; abating depression and anxiety shrinks the amygdala, and rebalances body hormones, even when achieved through meditation, psychotherapy, or other methods that would traditionally be described as psychological. The system works both ways, and a dismissal of that reality ignores union of opposites and principle of paradox quite obliquely. And afterall, the Vedic scriptures reference the third step to enlightenment as,”plants filled with light,” To add a little external ethos, almost all popular modernist thinkers(Watts, McKenna, Leary, Huxley, Wilson, Sheldrake)  agree with the notion that alteration of consciousness by one or the other are equally effective routes to the mystical experience. “All paths lead to God,” - Old Sufi saying. To add a little disclaimer, I have experienced other minor mystical experiences both before I had ever used mind altering substances, during use, and during periods of lengthy cessation since as well. 

Instead or re-raising this tireless argument, I wish to explain my experience, why I believe it was an awakening, and to ask for others to relate and discuss the experience itself and that of their own.


This was my third acid trip, but my strongest to date. I have since taken up to 900 micrograms, and have never felt anything nearly so intense. I rarely consume the substance anymore, and never seek it out, and I have come to believe it has shown me what it wanted to. I had previously been an athiest, then a pagan/shamanic revivalist, then an atheist again. I was quite young at my entrance to paganim(12) and my retun to atheism(15-16). At the time, I  had an interest in philosophy but no working knowledge. My point in mentioning this is to denote my interest in the mystical experience, but my inability to gain significant ground in it, as to provide an insight into the working psychology of the situation. 

I am curently 20. This experience occurred sometime  shortly before or after Christmas 2016. The date eludes me. I never bothered to record it, thought it might as well have happened yesterday. 

My experience was as follows: 

I had consumed roughly 540 micrograms of LSD in 3 180 microgram tabs, taken sequentially, roughly 4 hours before the experience. It was in the exact peak of the experience that this occurred to me, that is, it was at no point prior so powerful, nor after. I had started off just walking around in my finished basement, observing everyday objects and their dramatically altered appearance, as well as watching my face melt and shift in the bathroom mirror. Once it really started to kick in, about the two hour mark, I lied down with my torso on the couch and my legs hanging off, staring at the ceiling and the oscillating fan for about another two hours, simply contemplating the nature of things. After awhile I realized I had been there for some time, and I got up, walked around, and repositioned myself lying on the ground; I do not remember the exact position. Directly above my head was the ceiling fan, and I watched it’s monotonous spinning. I allowed myself to relax, and the effects intensified, the blades melted together into a spinning disk, and the circular light cover on the center(light turned off) joined in union. The entire arrangement twisted inward, and at that moment it occurred. The thing suddenly exploded; I was frozen to the ground in what I now understand to be corpse pose and my whole nervous system lit up electric, and then I saw it, literally. A golden ratio spiral, growing exponentially outward and expanding  until it subsumed my field of vision. It contained a frantic flurry of sequential images I can only describe as a history of the universe focused on humanity. An immense flash, a uniform haze, a bubbling and condensing, then distinction and shape, then structure and balance, briefly the sun,  the surface of a planet, suddenly covered in life, breathing(life, catastrophe, life catastrophe, life, catastrophe) then history, a building upwards, war, revolution, innovation, technology, modernity, then an advancement of those human elements so rapidly and inexplicable I could only discern a blinding energy and complexity. The experience I’m sure lasted less than ten seconds, but it might as well have been ten minutes. At the end, I was imparted with an absolute certainty of understanding with no knowledge of how I had attained it: that all things shared the same center, the same source and end, within and without. That all things were, somehow, all the same, all one. The image collapsed on itself and I was released from paralysis. I looked over my right shoulder, still lying down, and saw my dog looking at me quite concernedly. In that instant, the weight of the experience hit me, and I KNEW I was one with muh pooch. I got into a crawl, pet her and wept profusely. I said something pretty corny and of psychedelic staple, like,” Nova I AM you.”  And that was it, the trip persisted as a normal trip; I contemplated the experience for part of it, but felt extremely whole even though I did not understand what I had seen, or how it related to the gifted conclusion. I went upstairs and stared out the window for a great while. Hours later, I fell asleep to the five fold echoing of each passing second on my clock.

I later came to understand what I had seen, if only in a glimpse; the monad, it’s duality, the maya, brahman, atman, buddha, the Self, God, the immovable object, Nothing. 

Since my experience, I consider myself an amateur/hobby theosophist, and endeavor to learn about consciousness and spirituality from as many sources as possible, including: 
Freudian and Jungian psychology, classic, contemporary, and esoteric philosophy, brainwave entrainment and consciousness altering machines, meditation, astral projection, lucid dreaming, psychedelics(now focused solely on consciousness exploration and aided with meditation), yoga, pagan traditions, shamanic traditions, christian teachings, islamic teachings,  Kabbalah, Gnosticism, Hinduism, Buddhism, consciousness in quantum theory and the physical sciences, the list goes on. 

I understood what I saw maybe a year ago, six months in to my deep dive into all things spiritual, mystical, and psychedelic. But nothing ever described the experience till I read about Kundalini awakenings. I knew the instant I read the phrase,” the coiled one,” that this is what I had seen. No other awakening experience I’ve come to be aware of describes it: the seizure of the nervous system, the illumination of consciousness with overwhelming information, the inexplicable knowledge. 

The path this has led me on has culminated thus far in an acceptance of the universe, as well as the taming of my depression, anxiety, and countless other neurosis. No other single event has had such a strong sway on my development as a person. That being said, I am not without some trace of those maladies, though in amounts I consider healthy and  manageable. I still get upset, lose my temper, and feel down and even alone at times. This is okay; I know I always will, and that to strive for such an impossible state invalidates the pleasant feelings in time through lack of distinctive comparatives, and creates a never-ending desire. 

I leave this here today to relate the most vivid and influential experience I’ve had in my life, and to ask for you to relate yours, or at least award me your thoughts on my own. I hope this provides something to relate to for others out there who’ve experienced something similar. If nothing else, I hope it provides some food for thought.

Please, lemme know your thoughts below.

Cheers, peace, and namaste

8185,LSD,What did acid do to me?,"Okay so I am an 18 year old female and I have been a heavy weed smoker for multiple years and I love nothing more than being absolutely high off my ass. 

A couple months ago I decided to do acid. It was in early October and I thought it was the most amazing thing I have ever tried. I’ve done shrooms before many years ago, but to me, they couldn’t even come close to how euphoric acid made me feel. I felt like everything was just perfect and amazing and beautiful and nothing could change that. I was fully aware that I was tripping and I felt like I could completely control it, like nothing could make me have a bad trip. 

It has now been over 3 months since I’ve done acid and I have noticed a few things:
     1) Nothing really interests me anymore
     2) I can connect with anyone and feel their emotions just by looking at them 
     3) I cannot get super high anymore no matter how much I smoke

Let me explain each of these more in depth.

1) Nothing really interests me anymore:
What I mean by this is that everything that used to hold my attention seems so trivial and meaningless now. My phone, netflix, social media, books, even music, has just lost its appeal to me. I always am left with the sensation that there is so much more that I am not seeing or discovering and that the things that used to entertain me no longer have enough substance (for lack of a better word) to occupy my mind.

2) I can connect with anyone and feel their emotions just by looking at them:
This one I have started to recognize more and more increasingly recently. I don’t know what it is, but I can look at literally anyone and I am just overcome (“flooded with emotion” is an accurate phrase that comes to mind) with their energy. It is much deeper than just “feeling what they’re feeling”. I don’t exactly feel what they’re feeling, I can just feel all of the emotions they’ve associated with everything that has ever happened to them in their life. It is the most bizarre and enlightening experience and I have never felt anything like it before.

3) I cannot get super high anymore no matter how much I smoke:
This one has been pissing me off quite a bit lately as I mentioned earlier that being really high is my favorite thing ever! I get high everyday whether it be with my clear, bud, edibles, or wax. I live in Michigan and given the fact that it’s winter and I absolutely despise the cold, it has been dab szn for me because it’s much more convenient to dab inside than to smoke inside. That being said, I am not really getting that high anymore! No matter how many dabs I take! I still feel the physical affects of it because I get tired and hungry, but it feels like the psychological affects do not occur at all. I don’t even really feel high, more subdued. This is especially upsetting when the psychological affects are the affects that I desire most and I used to borderline hallucinate from getting high enough!

Anyways, I’m not sure what any of this really means, so I am open to all thoughts, opinions, questions, theories, answers, stories etc. 

I appreciate any help you can offer me!",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/adj23o/what_did_acid_do_to_me/
8186,heroin,My best friend is in detox again,"Don't really know how to word all of this so sorry if I'm a bit rambled. Also not sure if this is quite the right sub to post this on so any recommendations of other subs that could be helpful is welcomed. Sorry for the long post ...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.. I met J in college in 2012. She moved to Colorado from Massachusetts and we met our freshman year. We clicked immediately and have always had a special connection. Life was so good the first couple years of college. We partied and ate way too much molly to even really think about ... Lol. We would get drunk, silly high, trip sometimes, the occasional xanny weeks. But nothing too extreme. We weren't even doing blow and we definitely weren't even thinking about doing heroin.  Around late 2013 J was getting calls and texts basically WEEKLY about who overdosed &amp; who was dead back home. It was insane to experience this epidemic happening on the other side of the country while our lives were so different. 

&amp;#x200B;

Come mid 2014, due to life and money reasons, J had to make the really difficult decision to move back to Mass. We knew what it was going to be like out there so we made a game plan. She was going to work, save, and be back out to Co within a year. That didn't happen. She's a bit lazy and didn't follow through with our plan. Time passed and all was fine. We missed eachother so much, but we stayed in contact and knew we would be together again at some point. I was doing my own thing and life was pretty good. But then around mid 2017 I realized she was really hard to get a hold of and was essentially MIA from my life. When I finally heard from her she was a couple weeks into a 3 month stay at a sober house. She filled me in on the past several months. We cried and talked she expressed how badly she didn't want to live like that. I truly believed her and I still do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw J twice in 2018. In March we met with our whole group of close friends in Chicago for a music event that was near and dear to all of our hearts. It was beyond amazing for all of us to be together. She seemed okay. She was happy and had meat on her bones and we had the best time. She shoved a ton of K up her nose (and looking back now i wish i could have told her to chill) but it was a good time. Then in June she came out to Co to meet me, my bf, and our other great friend for a festival. Again - she seemed good and I truly believed she was doing good. Also again, a ton of K, some other goodies, but nothing too extreme. We cried saying goodbye but were trying to work on a plan to get her out here permanently again so we were feeling pretty optimistic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some time in November I realized she was extremely hard to get a hold of again. She wasn't opening snap chats, she would reply to two texts and and then I wouldn't hear from her again. I haven't had a good feeling about it and I couldn't stop thinking about it. So on Friday I reached out to her mom, H, and asked her to please fill me in  on what's going on. Mind you - I've never met H, but J and I have been friends for so long that I feel like I know her. She told me what I was dreading to hear, J was back in detox. She had checked herself in 12/21 after H found her sweaty and detoxing in bed for 24 hours. Again, she was adamant she didn't want to live that way.   

&amp;#x200B;

H is desperate to help J but literally has no way to do it. She told J she absolutely can NOT come back to live with her (where she was living). So basically it comes down to the fact that J has literally NO REASON to stay in Mass. She has no job, no place to live, no support, drug addict friends, and the ability to score a hit any where she is. If she stays in Mass she is going to die. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this is where I need help. I am willing to take J in. I WANT her to come and live with me. I don't have much to give her, but I will give her everything I possibly can to help her get on her feet and get her shit together. I want to give her a fresh start and a chance to clear her head and get away from all the bullshit that's following her. I will feed her, give her a place to stay, help her find a job, get her a bank account, monitor her money..literally ANYTHING and EVERYTHING I can do to help her. H and I are on the same page 100% and truly believe getting her on a one way plane to me is the only thing that is going to save her. She has 2 more weeks in detox and then will be doing 2-3 months at a sober house and then immediately after that I want to get her out here.  I know it's a lot to take on, but I literally can not sit back and watch her kill herself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I'm looking for from this... maybe some advice or some pointers from anyone that's been through anything similar. J is strong and resilient, but I know the disease is just as strong if not stronger. If anyone has any resources, book suggestions, or anything of the sort- Please send them my way. If you've read this whole thing, thank you.

8215,Psychedelics,200ug acid &amp; ketamine changed nitrous oxide balloon forever,"Hey guys I’m new around here and wanted to share an experience of mine as this seems like a pretty receptive community, so here we goooo.....

A few months ago after settling into my new flat at university, myself and a friend of mine (we’ll call him Stripe) decided to trip on some 300ug tabs of acid at our accommodation. A lot of people were tripping on acid over this weekend due to one of the student drug dealers in my block of flats getting these tabs, along with selling most of the common substances that students and young people use here (mandy, k, xans, coke etc etc). Shout out B u the one for that!

hopefully the following is coherent and reads nicely as I may end up just rambling rambling rambling 

Stripe took the whole tab as he was experienced with acid and just drugs in general. I have plenty of experience with drugs but had slightly less experience with psychs so decided to eat just over half of the tab and get a bag of ketamine to hand in case I wanted to further the experience. We smoked some weed as we always did in Stripe’s room with his flat mate E and her boyfriend J during the come-up to speed things along a little. I spent a lot of time in Stripes room smoking during this first period of my uni life as I had not yet the courage to do as he did and tamper with my fire alarm however the plan was to move into my room for the peak as it was far more cozy and equipped with softer lighting and some RGB LED lights along with more entertainment. Whilst smoking a few zoots I noticed stripe coming up rather fast and by this point so was I, noticing that maybe I looked a little loopy hehe ;)

J abruptly points out the sock that usually covers the alarm is missing “for faaaaacks stripe caaaaam on!” he says in his southern accent. Stripe jumps up on the bed and covers the alarm but remains there holding the alarm for a second after it’s covered and stays still for half a minute or so. Silence in the room. He comes back down and I can tell that the anxiety wave came at a really bad time for Stripe. “I got stuck up there dude” he keeps saying and at this point E &amp; J are looking at him like he is mad. The energy in the room is a little weird as we finish the zoots and I suggested we headed over to mine to sit and experience the peak. We played a psytrance set from Boom fest in Portugal and holy lord did this trip me out, the LEDs where strobing and my vision strobed in time with the music. My thoughts were fairly malleable with loops happening here and there but Stripe was having racing thoughts and didn’t seem to be very comfortable at all so we just kinda sat on the bed and meditated in each other’s company. At this point I think I had a mini ego death which was nice and playful and makes me want to experience full ego death, during this I thought about how our identities were meaningless and we were just two consciousness floating through space it was very intense but as if my ego was tied to my finger on a string and it could be used to ground myself at any time. 

After what felt like eternity and a day (maybe 40mins) Stripe came out and said something along the lines of “this is some dark shit dude” in reference to the thought loops he was on but he seemed to have gained a better understanding of how to navigate the trip during our meditation. I stood up and walked over to my desk and picked up my bag of k, holding it between my thumb and forefinger and next to my face, giving it a little shake as I smiled at stripe. Stripe is Indian and was not familiar with K so didn’t want to mix it so I took a small bump and sat back down. The k was mixing well so I hucked back 2/3 more bumps and then as it kicked in I prepared some nitrous which was also new for Stripe (exciting right!). For my first balloon I was going to use two canisters in the same hit to allow me to experience some astro shit which is where this gets interesting. Fear and Loathing was playing on Netflix with no sound and we had some nice uk DnB/jungle playing. I lay back on my bed in the starfish position and began hitting the loon and what happened next makes me wonder if anyone else has ever experienced this. Nitrous always fools me into thinking it somehow hasn’t worked and then WHAM I’m in another place entirely. What happened this time is that my deepest insecurities (which don’t inhibit me most of the time) where read aloud by my inner voice as I watched the intense CEVs and then something that would provide the solution and enlighten me, handing me the key to my own happines. Life changing stuff I thought at the time but just as the peak of the nitrous trip would be at its most intense, some new knowledge would enter my brain which would supersede what I just realised and place me back at square one; like a balloon bursting, I would come back. Not worse off or sad  but confused. Every time I have used nitrous since then, even sober, this happens and it’s very confusing/annoying. I’ve had now dozens of these lil breakthroughs of these kind only for them to be taken away from me by a new thought it is very strange. So close to being extremely profound but ultimately useless really which frustrates me.

During the rest of the trip, Stripe had his first nitrous experience and learned why they call it hippy crack, we walked into the city (it was dark and the town centre was v quiet) to look at the architecture and just relax over a few zoots. Then we got back to mine and interacted with my sober flatmate mal, who was very confused at my behaviour lol. Then I proceeded to get very ketty and walked around like Johnny Depp in Fear and Loathing it was very fun.

Thanks for reading guys it would be cool to discuss anything u may want to in this thread. I also plan to take acid again soon I am very excited. I think 300ug is next up

There I was minding my own business going to grab my weed from my stash spot, there was about 7g’s in there along with my grinder, papers &amp; a couple of mdma pills. 

Unfortunately there was a group of teenagers stood about 25m from the bush where I hide my stash, after I grabbed my weed and began walking away I noticed 3 of them follow me. As I was walking down an allyway I was aware that they were still following me, they were shouting things like “oi mate” and “hold up bruv”, I wasn’t really near any shops or anything so I eventually just stopped and shouted back “what”. I made sure to keep a good distance and kept walking backwards as I spoke to them, but damn I didn’t really think it through properly lmao. 

They got pretty close and started asking me what I grabbed from the bush, to which I responded “what’s it to you”, the guy on the left then pulled a massive fucking knife out of his hoodie pocket, so I turned and ran for the life of me. BUT, These guys were pretty damn quick and I could hear them gaining on me. I turned around after maybe 8-9 seconds of running? Took my stash out my pocket and told them to take it.

8249,Alprazolam,"Got prescribed Xanax , I knew it wouldn't end well..","So like a month ago, I went through a series of events that lead me to develop panic attacks and constant extreme anxiety.I tought I had caught tetannus (it was a weird weekend) and only 4 days later was told that I actually had my vaccine up to date ( the law changed and i didn't need to take my vaccine when I should have, but I didn't know that) and the stress and anxiety in those 4 days completly destroyed me.

I started having trouble breathing, muscle spasms cause by anxiety, panic attacks like 3/4 a day... It was terrible, I used to smoke weed /hashishe every single day all the time, and now I can't even have 1 puff before my brain spirals down into intense anxiety.

So after sorting everything up , and knowing I dind't actualy have tetannus and I wasn't going to die , I went to the doctor  (he's the one I my family take me to since I was born) to have a look at my anxiety and he told me I always had a predisposition to anxiety and gave me a prescription for Xanax .

As soon as I saw the word ""alprazolam"" on the paper I immedeately told him ""I don't want to take any benzos"", because of my previous MDMA / Ecstasy abuse that led me into depression and Brain zaps and mood swings. I know the symptoms from Benzo whitdrawal are the same as when your brain gets depleted from serotonin as It already happened to me once.

He completly disregarded my point and told me to take them up to 3 halfs a day until I felt better.

I started of slow, I took half in the first day and It helped me a lot, my anxiety went down immedeately! I just felt fucking great. (I had never taken a benzo before).

For the first 3-4 days I only took 1 half a day , but after that I started taking 2 halfs a day. And then 1 night I couldnt sleep I just dropped 1. And I was just feeling fucking fantastic everyday.

Then after all this had happened , I started to have Tinnitus (not sure why, can be due to the anxiety, hearing loss ,sinus infection, xanax side effects) , if you don't know it its a fucking annoying ringing in your ears that doesn't stop.. never, I've been having it for almost 2 weeks now, I'm having constant headaches, I'm having trouble sleeping, that sort of stuff.. So what do I decide to do? Take xanax to help me cope with this! bad idea... I just tought ""hey, I can stop whenever I want, I won't get addicted to these, I know how easy it is to get addicted to these, so I won't abuse it for sure""

Now my xanax is over, my tinnitus doesn't stop, I'm feeling all the whitdrawal symptions I felt when abusing MDMA / Ecstasy, nothing is getting better, my anxiety is worsening again, having even more trouble sleeping, I'm feeling like I'm going to go maaaad.

Sorry for the messy post, just needed to take this off my chest. Peace guys.

TL:DR: Doctor gave me xanax not knowing about my previous drug abuses, even tough I dind't want it, my parens /doctor talked me into taking it. Ended up over-using it and felt great.

8296,MDMA,Took Ecstasy for First Time on New Year's Eve... still feeling dizziness (8 days later). How concerned should I be?,"On NYE I took my first dose of ecstasy. I'm 27, ~100lbs, female. A friend of mine took the same as me, but 1.5x the size (he's 38, ~200lbs, 6') and has felt fine since.

For the last week I've been feeling dizzy... most of the time it's fairly mild, like being slightly buzzed (e.g. when walking on the sidewalk the world will feel like it's moving a bit more than usual and my balance feels a little tenuous, although I'm not stumbling or zigzagging). When sitting still I can notice something like fuzziness / disorientation in my peripheral vision, but can focus on whatever's in front of me. But multiple times a day it will get more intense (e.g., especially if suddenly entering a stimulating environment with lots of noise &amp; movement) and I'll feel quite disoriented (I'll want to shoot my eyes around everywhere to ""stabilize"" how each thing is relating to each other thing I see). This usually lasts about 10 minutes before calming down again.

It doesn't seem to be decreasing / getting a lot better. I have been drinking a lot of water and am starting to eat salt b/c I think it might have to do with low blood pressure, but I haven't yet noticed much change, which a friend thinks is odd (he says blood pressure should respond quickly).

I’ve noticed that I literally have no self control when it comes to xanax though. If I take them twice in a row, I will take them everyday until I’m out. I took 8 bars in about a week last week (all i had). I don’t get any rebound effects or WD’s though... or even the craving to do them again. I obviously want to but I know I can’t go buy more and keep on. It’s a very strange relationship. I probably will never buy large amounts of xanax just for this reason though.

8391,Inhalants,My love for Nitrous,"I have been doing NOS for a few years now and god do I love Nitrous.

It makes every trip better. MDMA + NOS blows you into outer space.
Ketamine + NOS gives me the most extreme disso effects I’ve ever felt.
LSD + NOS is a combination I can’t even describe you HAVE to try it.

Besides making every trip better, its also such a great drug to try sober. 1 cartridge makes my body tingle and gives me great laughter.
2 cartridges already send me up in space and make me feel odd but euphoric.
3 cartridges and I feel like I break through and there’s a story that keeps on playing on repeat in my head.

I’ve recently done 5 cartridges at once for the first time and even though I nearly passed out, I definitely had the most insane trip in my life.

8642,MDMA,I've taken way too much molly..,"So long time lurker few time poster, I'm looking for some advice. I discovered MDMA for the first time half way through 2018, and it was amazing. I went to paradiso with VIP tickets for free and decided fuck it. I'd taken a lot of shrooms and some other drugs before I figured it was time to try it. I took about 6 points and rolled for fucking hours, the high was probably too much honestly as I was out of commission for the time but it was amazing.

Now before you guys say it, I know I've fucked up. It sucks and I am prepared to deal with the damage for years to come but I need some advice on what to expect in the future to come. 

After Diso I was hooked on the rave scene and immediately bought tickets to bass canyon, and about 3 grams of molly to go with. I waited anxiously for a couple months before it came and didnt take any more. But once I was there all bets were off. I took 4 points on day 0 and stayed up all night partying. Day 1 I ended up taking about 8 points and some acid, again staying up all night. On the second day I took 14 points over the course of the day and into the next. It was crazy I don't remember a whole lot just dancing in the pits. When I woke up on the last day I felt like a shell. Nothing inside to give so I abstained and stayed sober. Over the next week I definitely felt off like I expected but other than that next week I didn't really have any side effects. After that I decided I should stay clean for a bit. That lasted all of a couple months.

November rolls around and I decided to go to Rezz in Seattle and I again took way too much. After it was all tallied up I'd taken another gram in a single night. Woke up the next day feeling a little off but nothing like I expected to feel and after a couple days again I had no side effects that I could tell of. Then I fucked up big time. My dealer told me he'd sell me an Ounce of molly for dirt cheap straight from the Netherlands and like a fool me and 2 buddies went in on it. That was at the end of November.

Here we are now on the seventh of this year, and I'm out. I bought 10 grams in November and I took it all in a span of months. I won't go into the details of every time I did it but I did at least a gram every time basically and before you say it I know how bad this is. I'm not looking for judgement just some advice. What is the future going to look like for me, as of now I don't really have any side effects that I've noticed. My emotions are pretty stable, my memory is okay I guess, and my mental health seems as good as it's ever been really. I imagine there is going to be some damage obviously but what should I expect in the next 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, etc? Thanks in advance to anyone with experience.

8701,Long Post,"Quarter of mushrooms(bad/good)trip report, 2 years ago and was in bad mindset.","I dont condone the use of any drug, but I feel I need to tell a little story that changed me.

Before I start, I should give some context.
I was diagnosed with chronic depression at an early age(13), and was rediagnosed again at 20.
I got kicked out by my ex roommate, and in a nutshell it's because I called him out on his drug addiction and how it was fucked up i was paying most the bills....started a huge fight and moved out, I got an apartment with new roommates who were worse(which of course I didnt know at first).
The couple, which me and my girl moved in with ended up breaking up day 1 of moving in, without her telling us the reason why...the guy that stayed in the room never payed rent for 2 months, I was about to kick him out, found out before I kicked him out that he raped his 12 y/o sister when he was 15...yah huge news, so had an even bigger reason to get him out, he threatened to kill me also...anyways found heroin in his room after kicking him out, I got very upset, because i let another addict use me...more than that happened in that 3 months period, just a few things that went down.
I got extremely depressed a few nights later, so I decided to buy a quarter, and take them, my girl was my trip sitter, so she smoked weed and watched.

This was 2 years ago, so I'll tell you what I remember.
0:00 took all at once, with orange juice and chocolate, no weed, empty stomach
0:30 didnt really feel anything other than a small warm stomach feeling.
0:45 walls started warping, this lasted for 5 mins, and went away for some reason, nothing else
0:55 nothing, started thinking they were bunk, was wondering if wasted 70 dollars or not.
1:00 everything changed, full on hallucinating, super fast change, saw a stone temple dragon that was turning like it was a trophy on the ceiling ...
1:05 germ looking little blocks start bouncing around the dragon, they look like they are splitting, my girlfriend starts holding me because she can see that it was already overwhelming me, I can see fine, but everything I look at warped into some creature.
1:15 tripping pretty much the same,except it takes a weird turn, veins start slowly growing out the wall, surrounding me, feeling claustrophobic.
1:25 veins start getting reachable distance, I go to grab one but it backs away, as if it was saw me trying to grab it
1:30 veins start reaching out again, I dont try to grab them this time, but I feel like I should've, the veins grabbed my arms, and held me down, I start feeling like I'm blacking out.
1:40 I dont remember anything for the last 10 mins, dont remember escaping the veins, i just appeared standing up in the kitchen, I felt like I blinked and appeared there, I went back in the room confused, couldn't see anything that looked normal, I kept having miniature blackouts, hard to explain.
2:00 needed to throw up, i ran into the bathroom, threw up, i look in the toilet, and well....parasites, i saw parasites in my throw up, a bubble that look like a jellyfish also, and it was moving....I starting thinking the mushrooms were infected, I thought I was I dying, my brain was disconnected from my body...I felt like I was dying but couldn't come to terms with it, I didnt understand (is this ego death? Comment what you think, never tripped this hard)
2:30 still in bathroom, realized that the parasites were hallucinations, and that I shouldn't believe everything, realized that I forgot I took mushrooms, I hated myself, I was so depressed I took a drug because I couldn't face life itself, I couldn't handle what I was going on, I couldn't see anything other than what my brain wanted me to see...I looked back in the toilet, the parasites was gone, realized it was normal puke, what a relief, still kept Tripping very panicky tho.
3:00 back in the room, still in a panic, still struggling to hold myself, my girl tries to be around me, checked my pulse, it was higher than normal from the panic, still scared, couldn't tell it was my gf helping me.
3:20 start realizing I'm ok, my vision and brain still fucked, but i realize that if I was gonna die now, i was ready, i did this to myself,( i should note, i didn't talk throughout the 1:20 - 3:20, not one word.
3:40 i was talking to my girl what I was seeing, as it was going full strength still, veins still hanging out the walls, candle in the room making the whole room look like it was on fire in a way, she turned on comedy(some fluffy channel on YouTube where he talks about funny pictures and such)dudes beanie looks like its warping into his head, couldn't tell if it was human or not.
4:00  feeling totally like shit, feeling panicky, and wondering if it was gonna ever end, or if I was gonna be like this my whole life...I at least knew I was safe from parasite, but still afraid I fucked my mind.
5:00 cant remember anything from the past hour just remember slowly calming down, at this time my vision started coming back, my mind was clearing up and thinking a bit easier instead of being so scared.
5:30 I feel total clarity, everything is ok, straight happiness, happiness that I never felt before...like I found something I been looking for years, my bad trip did a total 360 into being the best trip of all time.
My mind kept telling me to be happy and that it was ok, almost as if all the bad feeling I had for the last few months were gone...
For the first time in my life I felt true happiness, just happy to be alive, happy to be where I'm at today.
6:00 not seeing much now, hallucinations are pretty much down, just a little warping here and there, just amazed on how my life can change so quick.
7:00 pretty much came down at this point, still mindblown from the night, never thought any of that was real till I saw it first hand...fell asleep around this time, had some crazy dreams, I was exhausted.

 Woke up the next day feeling amazing, my mind was straightened out, felt great, even though shit still happened in the next week...to this day, 2 years later, I still have a happiness from that trip, I havent taken any psychedelics since, not even really smoked weed or drank alcohol, felt no need to actually. I get sad and my depression builds up from time to time, but nowhere as bad as it was then...even though it was a bad trip, was the best decision I ever made was to take those mushrooms that night.

I should note, I've done a good amount of psychedelics before this trip(20-30 times)
Ket, lsd, mushrooms, mdma, dxm, etc(all moderate doses)
Never done anything harder, also, huge difference from 5 grams to a quarter of shrooms.
I raved so I candyflipped and did some other kinda dumb things.
I do not reccomend taking this amount until you are fully aware of how high you actually get, I personally thought I could handle it, guess not.
I will say this, dont regret taking them, sounds crazy, but it has helped me long term more than anything else has.

No hate please.

8769,Cannabinoids,How to be a stealthy stoner: Pro tips on how to hide smell and increase efficiency for smoking,"If you live in a place that isn’t 420 friendly, but you still want to smoke, you need to take some precautions to not get caught. In the past three places I’ve lived it’s been strictly against the rules to smoke weed, but I have figured it out and haven’t been caught once. Here are my pro tips on how to do it.

The main giveaway for weed is the smell. It’s strong, unmistakable, and fills up a space like nothing else. The main thing you need to hide is the odor, both while smoking and storing it. 

For hiding the smell while smoking: 
•Get a Smokebuddy or some similar carbon filter to exhale into. I found a Smokebuddy at my local smoke shop for like $20. Best tool I’ve ever bought for smoking. 
•Use a small bubbler. Any pipe that involves the smoke passing through water will make it smell less and be much easier on your throat and lungs. Don’t use a joint or blunt. 
•Don’t use a joint or blunt because you need to eliminate all smoke going into the air. When you light the bowl in your pipe, only light a small amount and keep pulling until it’s not cherried at all. This means you should take smaller hits. 
•The two sources of smoke are from the pipe and your mouth. Eliminating those are your goal. Exhale your whole hit into the filter and don’t let any smoke rise from the bowl. 

This also makes your consumption incredibly efficient. If you do it correctly you will literally eliminate all wasted smoke and end up using less weed for the same high. 

Another classic stoner efficiency trick is the hemp wick. You should be able to find a long hemp wick for only a few bucks at a smoke shop. I always wrap it around my lighter and use that to light my bowl. It improves the life of the lighter by a ton and prevents you from inhaling butane. 

For hiding the smell in storage:
•Get odor proof containers. I’ve always used mason jars. Put anything that may smell like weed in the jar. Most pipes are glass and most grinders are metal. You’ll need to protect those things from scraping/banging against each other by wrapping them in something (I use clean socks for each). 
•Put your container(s) in a well hidden place where you know no one will find it and you can access when you want to smoke. I stash mine in a suitcase in my closet hidden underneath my hanging clothes. I can lock my suitcase if I need. 
•Rinse out your pipe after every use to keep it clean. 

By eliminating odor in the first place, you won’t need to use much (if any) odor covers. Many people just spray cologne or burn incense or sage or whatever to over power the smell of weed. That’s a dangerous game to play because you can often still smell the weed behind it and having and overwhelming smell like that can suspicious. 

Weed can also be smelled on your clothes and you breath. Again, if you eliminate the smoke in the first place you don’t have to do much. If you got smoke on your clothes, change them and wash them soon after your smoked. Ideally you have access to your toothbrush so you can brush your teeth and gargle water to rinse your mouth. Shower if you can too. 

Everybody has heard weed makes your eyes red and you should use eye drops. I used to put eye drops in but usually don’t anymore. If your eyes get super bloodshot and you’re worried about it, sure go for it. If not, don’t worry about it. 

Of course if you don’t want to smoke at all or don’t want to take this many steps/precautions just to hide it, maybe consider trying edibles. They usually don’t smell strongly, if any. Hide them in a safe spot. Experiment with how they affect you, how much you should take to be comfortably high, and how long they take to kick in. They can be really different than just smoking. 

Those are the main things you can physically do to improve efficiency and hide the smell and your stash. But of course there’s the whole other half to this - the practice of appearing sober while your high. That is a whole different discussion for another reddit post. Hope this helps if you’re worried about getting caught or just looking for some tips for getting stoned!

Then last month I got the flu and took delsym again for the first time since high school and once again, I felt fucked off of the recommended dosage. For like a full 24 hours as well.

I usually take a tolerance break for about a month every three months, and I was coming back from one of my breaks, just craving a fat dab. I couldn’t find my pen. OhFuckOhFuckOhFuck, but then I remembered how to make a improvised juul charger. I experimented upon this idea, and wired up some shit using an Apple charger I cut open, and the red and black wires of the 4 inside, and cutting away the other two. You stick that red one in the hole of the cartridge, and the other on the outside metal of the cart, and you start firing that better than any battery ever could. It’s smarter than any knife dab. I’m currently stoned as shit off these wires. Me and all my buddies have a language around all this shit, where we just incorporate “Gretchel” into everything we say. It was one of my buddies first time with dabs, and he just started saying that shit and it stuck. So many people in my area say it. Call us in the PNW crackheads, but we do that shit. Have a nice night. I could also teach you how to make “Gretchel wires”, as we call them.

Edit: it’s been about 8 months since I discovered this trick. my tolerance is too high to use cartridges. I go through a gram of oil every day on my rig and I don’t think I could stop smoking if I tried. I’m growing my own shrooms (strain: type B. Substrates are super easy to make with vermiculite and perlite, and I usually have a successful yield of 3/4), I have talked to god about 4 times, and I know what the end is and how. We will prepare for it. Microdosed acid for 2 months, probably the smartest person on earth. Gretchel has evolved in ways unperceived by man. We all say shit like gretchular or grivvle or bevel now. There are variations of course, like gregley or gregular, or rivel, but fuck guys I can’t believe I ever started doing anything fuck, I grew up in a white ass middle class home",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/adq1am/i_am_considered_the_smartest_crackhead_alive/

8813,Methamphetamine,My Meth Rape Story.,"Hey reddit. So some of yall wanted to hear my meth rape story. There've been a couple of threads where I've told half this story in the comments and y'all wanted me to type it out so here goes.

My Meth Rape Story.

I'm bisexual. I'm not going to deny I do gay shit sometimes. It's not always been that way. I definitely wasn't attracted to men at all from ages 8-12, but something fucking happened between ages 12-13 cuz i just found girls boring and repetitive and gayness was like a kink to me so i explored it though porn and yadda yadda years later Im 19 sometimes I do gay shit.

Been on the grindr a bit. Met some people sometimes usually its just sex. 

Probably the most conventionally attractive guy I've been with, got me like uncomfortably drunk

2 of his friends show up. I'm already too fucking drunk to know the right thing to do, which is to LEAVE! So I just kinda sit there. They pull they're cocks out and suddenly its a gangbang, no questions asked. I'm super drunk. This is like my 5th time with alcohol and ive already had wayyy more than I should. The sex just happens. Anyway then the meth comes out in the form of a syringefull of liquid meth.

I'd been on my stomach for a while with them playing with my ass so It just felt like a weird dildo before the fuckign cold ass liquid. It was a lot too. It was a fucking huge syringe. They told me later it was tina. Meth. So that sucks. Breaking bad here we go. 

It was awesome. Made me fully want to be like super gay. It was horrible, they were really violent with me after that. After a while they did so many drugs their peckers couldn't work so the sex ended. Well not with one of them, he kept going till like 6 am. Then he just chucked me out.

So here I was. No longer super drunk, SUPER FUCKING METHED OUT OF MY MIND.

The man in the uber can smell it though my sweat. My heart is racing out of control. I can't stop fidgetting.

I get home. Shower. Put new clothes on. Look in the mirror and say. YOU GOT THIS.

Grab a can of diet pepsi, walk to class.

I get to class and it says i have to walk to another class.

Shits feeling fucked. I am so fucking fucked up right now walking into class. With my god damn diet pepsi.

10 minutes into class I'm like. This shit is bad. People can notice. I gotta get the FUCK OUT!

But i keep it cool. I need to not make a scene. I think I played it off well because only 1 person commented that I was looking off that day.

Anyway, I'm drinking the diet pepsi. holy fucking shit. the diet pepsi tastes JUST LIKE THE METH. its so disgusting they made me smoke it too okay ):

So class ends. I fucking walk straight home. I email my classes that I have a migraine. I get migraines a lot so its not that rare to happen. I get home and lay under the covers and just suffer. The comedown was FUCKING INSANELY PAINFUL AND HORRIBLE it was the worst thing to ever happen to me. I was mentally broken. Just fucking broken and beaten and gone. Day 1 of the comedown was the worst. I couldn't stop doing the mouth clicking thing where you just cycle ur jaw round and around. I'm a musician so I tap out beats all the time. Now im doing it with my teeth and i cant stop. I mean i can force myself to stop but itll come back. It didnt really ever go away, sometimes ill do it to this day. after day 5 I felt like i could control it.

that shit was horrible. I'd sweat like a motherfucker. Fucking drenched my sheets in meth sweat. I showered often cuz I knew i smelled so bad. I hope my roommate has no idea. 

Day 2 I tried to smoke weed to see if it'd help.

It didn't ):

Well they ended up bruising my balls. It hurts like a MFKER. 

I go through 3 days of staying at home, and only communicating with the world through email. But I backed myself into a corner of having to go to the health center on campus.

So day 3 I'm in the health center. Still slightly smelling from the sweat. I go in, tell them my migraine problem, and that its prevented me from drinking much so im dehydrated. In reality I hadn't eaten or drank anything in 5 days. I got methed on Sunday night, so I ate Sunday Morning, and the next time I ate was Day 4 at night.

Day 4 I asked my sister to take me to urgent care for my ballsack and the dehydration. I don't smell too bad. I look fucking bad and my heartrate still hasn't calmed the fuck down. But I'm thinking alright. 

The doctor looks at my ballsac and tells me I need to get it ultrasounded, so he sends me to another urgent care on the other side of LA. FINE. I didn't even get an IV, i just immediately left to the new place.

I get to the new place and it only takes like 30 minutes to get seen thank god. I go in, talk to the doctor, everything goes well. I'm like fuck when is this gonna turn south.

So they say they need to take my blood incase i need to have surgery, they'd need the blood and they'd need it asap.

I have to just refuse him doing that. Say yes to the iv, I want the water. I NEED THE WATERRRRRRR. God water makes you feel so much better when ur MEGA METH DEHYDRATED. So yeah. I just refuse him. Its SUPER AWKWARD. The doctor is like poking at me a little bit to see if I realise how stupid he thinks I am. I have to just bashfully refuse it and furrow my brow and not act like an asshole because they probably think im an asshole, but im literally super fucked right now so just lets get the ultrasound going

so this ladys touching my balls doing the ultrasound

idk where I was going with that

Okay so I'm sitting in the doctors office thinking, if it comes back positive, I need surgery, they HAVE to take my blood, they're gonna know i have meth in me, I am going to JAIL mother fucker, or at the very least my parents WILL FIND OUT, which is absolutely analogus to going to jail since they're NParents and they control my life. They'd know I'm Bi and That'd be horrible. 

It comes back and I'm okay. They send me home.

My sister helps me out, buys me some groceries. I go home, take 2 giant bong hits, eat some crackers and fucking sleep.

Day 5 I had a hamburger and I kept it down.

I don't know where I went from there. I had to rebuild my life from the ground up, starting with going back to school. I took pretty much an entire week off. Day 5 night I went to rehearsal for the play I was acting in. 

Thats pretty much the entire story. ",177,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/adq93n/my_meth_rape_story/

I’m not a fan of snorting shit so I just swallowed one 10mg capsule about 25 minutes ago, and on an empty stomach.

I’m about to lie in bed with all the lights off and watch some YouTube. What else should I expect while it continues to kick in? And any ways I can make my reaction more prone for hallucinations?

8914,I :love: Drugs,"Adderall, nicotine, and weed","I am a freshman girl in college and throughout high school, I was never really into drugs of any kind. Only the occasional alcohol consumption like most people. But when I tried weed for the first time, I loved the effect it had on me. I’ve been smoking regularly since sophomore year. This time period is also when I first started vaping. I obviously liked the buzz the nicotine gave me, which is why I still continue to vape now.
My senior year of high school is when I first tried Adderall. My cousin has ADD, so he let me take a couple. It was the BEST feeling ever. I just felt happy, talkative, and full of energy. I asked my cousin if I could attempt to do his makeup, and he reluctantly said yes. It took me two fucking hours. And in the end, it looked like absolute shit. He was so pissed but we both thought it was funny as hell. After that, we sat in the same spots for six hours straight just talking about the universe and shit. I took the first addy at around 9pm, the second one around 3am, and then went to sleep the next day around the same time. I was wired the whole day, and at first it was nice. But eventually, as the day progressed, the euphoria started to fade until I just felt numb and felt like crying. I’ve heard this is normal when coming down from adderall, so it didn’t worry me. I was completely fine and normal the following day.
Normally, when people say shit about how weed, alcohol, etc, are highly addictive, I don’t bat an eye. I don’t have an addictive personality, so it’s easy for me to go without weed/nicotine for long time periods without having withdrawal symptoms. But after the Adderall was completely worn off the next day, all I could think about was how good the high was and that I definitely wanted to do it again. A few days later, those thoughts faded and I got back to my normal self. I decided to wait awhile before popping more addys because i knew how much i liked the high and how addictive they were. I knew using it in moderation would do little to no harm. 
Okay so fast forward to yesterday. My cousin came over and we each took two 30mg pills around 7:30pm. The high was amazing and during, I downloaded Reddit onto my phone. I was obsessed and reading literally everything under this Community out loud to my cousin. That went on for probably 5 hours. Then I played Rainbow 6 Siege for like 3 hours straight, completely dominating in multiplayer. Went back to Reddit afterwards and have been switching between the two throughout the day. Now, though, I feel like I can still feel a bit of the euphoria, but I can tell I’m coming down from it because of how numb i feel. Its a strange sensation.

But to make a long ass story short, my questions are:
1) Is it normal to feel numb/a bit depressed when coming down from Adderall? Also, is it normal to still feel the effects this much over 24hrs later? Any stories/personal experiences you can share?
2) I find it strange that I was hitting my vape (Suorin Drop with 45mg salt nic juice) constantly throughout the night, not going a few minutes without  hitting it. It didn’t give me a buzz (which is normal since I do use it regularly). Has this happened to anyone else? Would the two bowls I smoked before have something to do with that? 

Sorry for the length of this and the unnecessary details, it might be the Adderall lmao. 
Thanks in advance, all input is appreciated.

8945,Cannabis,Combinations to help with weed social anxiety?,"I smoke daily and love it for several reasons. However, whenever I smoke, my social anxiety increases substantially even with my closest friends. The other day I woke up with a nice MDMA afterglow and smoked a joint and it was the best high I've had in a long time just because I *didn't* get that anxiety. Made me yearn for a ""regular"" weed high, a simple high without that anxiety. Does anyone know any combos that can help me achieve this? I've got some Kratom coming in the mail (for seperate reasons) but I've heard that the cannabis/kratom combo was mostly the weed overpowering it, even though kratom is known to help social anxiety. I also enjoy mixing weed with caffeine, but it's nothing compared to weed/MDMA. I've never mixed it with other stims because I mostly use those for studying, but I bet it would help at least a little; I just don't really want to use stims every time I smoke if I can help it. I also live in an illegal state so it's harder to get specific strains.

I also totally get that I could just stop smoking. I'm just looking to see if there's any options out there that I might've missed in my research.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/adra10/combinations_to_help_with_weed_social_anxiety/
8995,Stimulants,Permanent long term effect from MDMA/Molly,"Hey r/drugs! On New year's I rolled for the first time and I rolled my fucking tits off. I took a heavy dose of some pure shit and it seems like the experience has left lasting permanent effects on my brain. Almost as if mdma rewired my brain. I've noticed that it's a lot easier to talk to people. I use to get anxious and nervous when striking up a conversation. After rolling I've been really outgoing and socializing way more frequently. My confidence has definately improved too. Before I rolled I felt like an introvert but now I feel like an extrovert. I constantly crave human interaction especially from the opposite sex. I had a lot of anxiety and had numerous insecurities. My anxiety and insecurities seem to be almost non existent now. I've become waaay more comfortable talking to the opposite sex, physical contact and interaction is so much more easier and it's amazing! I've started to rebuild life long damaged relationships, buried many hatchets, and my empathy towards others have skyrocketed. It's a lot easier to pick out people with good and bad vibes too. I really like where I am now and I don't remember the last time I've been this happy. I'm really comfortable with who I am too and I have become far less self conscious. Things that would normally bug or irritate me aren't even noticable. I've become a lot more patient with others too. My bad habits have been heavily impacted as well. I've stopped biting my nails, stopped procrastinating, negative thoughts have drastically been reduced, stopped bad eating habits, and I've become way more organized. Is this a wave that will eventually die down? Or is this something that will last? Any insight would be wonderful. Thanks!

9007,Alprazolam,Question regarding safety using xanax and / or Hydromorphone while coming down off amphetamines.,"Is it safe to use both of these together when coming down off amphetamines ? Is hydromorphone safe on it's own?  


Usually just take 1-2mg of xanax and smoke weed when the comedown is particularly shitty and that does the trick but all that is available is one .50 of xan which won't do much and a few 4mg hydromorphone which Iv'e never tried before under these circumstances.   I searched and saw people did take them for comedowns but there was little to nothing about health risk / safety etc. Already took the .50 xan so I was thinking of taking just one but I'm weary. Amphetamine as in speed. Not meth. Street too =|  


Is it safe to use both of these together when coming down off amphetamines ? Is hydromorphone safe on it's own ?   


 Any knowledge / guidance would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I already have pretty bad anxiety sometimes but i’ve really been wanting to try acid. I just can’t tell if my urge to try it is stronger than my fear of trying it. I always make indefinite plans with my friends to do acid with them but it never happens and now that there’s a specific time and place that we’re going to be doing it, i’m super nervous. I know that when the time comes i’m gonna go into the trip nervous and i’m afraid it’ll ruin it and i’ll have a bad trip. **I’m also afraid of having flashbacks later in life after i try it, but i’ve never been sure if those are completely real or not, i’ve been told many different things about that. 

I also only wanted to do 1/4 of a tab but my friends say that 1/2 will be better because if i only do 1/4, i won’t really be feeling it, and i’d probably be bored with it. They wouldn’t pressure me into taking half and i want to play it safe with 1/4. 

Does anyone have any tips for how i can avoid a bad trip or what i can do to stop a bad trip as it’s happening? Is there anything i can do to get me more excited than nervous about trying LSD? Also, i’m concerned about the flashbacks people always talk about, are they real, how serious are they, and how common are they in people after they do acid?

9067,Stimulants,300 mg of Caffeine with no tolerance and no food for 8 hours is making me feel like what I assume is comparable to a minor meth comedown.,"I'm not posting looking for advice or to recommend this to anyone. This post is NOT about how Caffeine is a ""Dangerous drug with potential for abuse."" If drugs had accurate classes peesonally I would classify caffeine in the same class as nicotine. The only difference in my opinion, besides effects, is that drinking coffee or energy drinks is inherently less harmful than vaping or smoking. Blah blah yeah 90% of the world uses caffeine a drug let's all jerk each other off while chanting this so we can get our dream of all drugs legalized. Oh wait fuck that fucking Anslinger guy that won't happen for a super fucking long time no matter how much circle jerking. 

Anyways, it's 2:43 in the FUCKING MORNING and I feel so fucking paranoid it's actually insane.

Flashback, 5:30 P.M. Tuesday, January 7th. I wake up from a nap with a fairly empty stomach, and soon after I chug an energy drink. 300mg of caffeine. Empty stomach = very rapid absorption. I am very experienced with this, only difference is I took a little break from caffeine because after being on Adderall for a few weeks it lost it's attractiveness. However, tonight I decided fuck it. Got one last project for school to graduate I need a little booster. 

Flash fucking forward to an hour later. I'm acting really weird with my girlfriend. I really want to fucking BITE THE SHIT OUTTA HER. I genuinely have the urge to bite her lip off and fucking make it bleed. But I love her, don't want to hurt her, and I don't want to go to jail so I obviously don't. However I do kinda softly bite her thigh and shit and I bit my knee skin pretty fucking hard. 

Acting weird all night. Start to work on project around 11pm. Going good. 11:41 holy fuck what the fuck is wrong with me the painted title on my poster takes up WAY too much space. No spray paint. Fuck have to buy new  board. 11:50 proceed to text GF tell her I'm a failure and hate myself. 

12:00 I return from Walmart with new poster board. I cry on the phone with my GF about being a failure. Hate myself. Same old same old. Flash forward 2 hours later, I have one letter completed. ONE FUCKING LETTER IN 2 AND A HALF HOURS BECAUSE EVERY LETTER HAD TO BE PERFECT. I did have 2 works traced almost perfectly but ran out of space and had to rewrite. The N had to be perfect and took maybe 30 mins to figure out how to make that happen.

Complete N. Proceed to question wtf I'm doing at 2 in the morning making a poster that I'll get an A on if I print out my fucking title perfect. Proceed to go to bathroom and pop any tiny pimple I can find. Feel like I'm cumming. Proceed to eat. 

In the kitchen when I'm making my food I know if my mom comes out I'm going to FUCKING SCREAM because I will get so scared. I live in an apartment building so I can hear any other sounds or sounds my house makes SO WELL and am noticing every one of them. At one point I felt like I imagined a sound. Fucking whack.

Anyways, I've never felt like this on Adderall. I used it for productivity so I knew the better I cared for myself the better it would work. Just keep in mind to take care of yourself when using any stimulants. Have a great day thanks for reading.

My method - which yields results better than any other way i've tried - is to fill your balloon, empty your lungs and then only inhale around half of the Nos, using the inhaled Nos to breathe in and out of the balloon, effectively only breathing Nitrous until i can no longer continue the cycle.

Now i know this is not the safest method by far, but we take minimum 30 minute rests between balloons and this method absolutely sends you soaring through the astral planes.

I'm glad I did, because it's changed me for the better. I can finally focus now and do things again. Still not 100% feeling better, but I do feel better.

I told my therapist this and he said that I should move up to 100mg or 75mg, that way I can reach the full benefits of the medication.

He said to talk to my psychiatrist first.

I see my psychiatrist in two days. I was going to ask to move up to 100mg. I don't think I need to go to 75 and then 100, I think I can handle going from 50mg up to 100mg.

I know that when starting new medications, things can get kind of crazy. I'm afraid of feeling intense anxiety and things like that.

Would it help at all to have some Xanax on the side or something? Currently on risperidone 2mg, mirtazapine 15mg, and zoloft 50mg.

I know Xanax is extremely addicting. And so is Kloponin. So I was going to be very careful and try not to abuse it. Just use it as needed.

Over the night tonight though I slowly increased my dose by one quarter per 30-45 minutes. I've now taken about 4 bars and I can't sleep. Are my bars bunk or did I build a tolerance?

9151,Cannabis,Absolute amnesia on marijuana,"Hey, so even writing about this makes me paranoid. Basically, I'm sure I have PTSD from this incident but its not exactly easily explainable to people as others think I'm absolutely crazy. So in freshers week at university in Sept 2018 I was incredibly stressed by the whole thing of drinking with people you've basically just met. It had been 3 days into the week and although I'd made friends there in my uni accomodation, I was still anxious and not getting a lot of sleep.

I decided the next evening to just smoke weed with some of those friends- yet I come from a rural area and my tolerance was nOT used to the high potency strain in this particular city. I smoked way too much way too quickly and began to have multiple panic attacks as we walked back to our accomodation from the park that we smoked it in. It was the terrifying realisation that I had ingested too much and there was nothing I could do to get it out. Basically, my brain fully shut down at one point. I was looking at one of my new friends in the face as he was telling me to ""breathe...breathe..hey....listen to me"" and I could not compute. I didn't understand where I was, who I was, who this person was and I seemed to become convinced that I ceased to exist and this was all just a simulation. This moment of him looking in my face and talking to me, seemed to go on for an eternity (I later found out it was about 5 minutes). This was all probably made worse by the fact that I had only just arrived to the city itself and was very new to the surroundings and people. We went up to the accomodation and I slurred my words but said I wanted to go to bed, so I did. Literally, worst night of my life. Forgot absolutely everything about myself, where I was and why I was there and just lay in the dark half asleep. I fully was convinced that nothing actually existed and some existential questions central to it swirled round and they are haunting me to this day.

I woke up the next day still disorientated, confused and shaking. Gradually, the day went on and I recalled senses of myself and my identity but this experience has robbed me of what I feel my full personality was. I have since dropped out of university as the anxiety was too much to bear and I needed to process this trauma around my family and familiarity.

I am going to EMDR therapy for this, as well as CBT for my ongoing anxiety issues. And yes, I know, the set and setting were awful and it was the most stupid mistake I've ever made in my life to smoke that much when I was anxious and had a low tolerance. **But can anyone on here help me to comprehend what may of happened in my brain that night?** I'm constantly ruminating as to whether I have permanent brain damage from this or whether it was laced (the guy who bought the weed says it wasn't). None of the other people smoking the stuff had the same reaction because I'm guessing their tolerance was much higher. Also, I was never a huge user of weed before (since this, ive cut it out altogether).",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/adu0q7/absolute_amnesia_on_marijuana/
9170,GABAergics,Question about GABA drugs,"If someone is taking multiple GABAergics, does tolerance develop as a whole? Like if someone is taking GHB, Benzos, Carisoprodol and drinking Alcohol, not together, but everyday throughout 5 days or so and plans to continue, is tolerance going to develop for all of them? Or because they have different chemical structures is it not like that? For instance  if GHB is taken the most and others are mixed in during off time will tolerance for each build because they all effect GABA?

I really like vaping nicotine (50mg in my Suorin) but I quit that a while ago because I found myself feinding nicotine (like hitting it constantly), not even getting a buzz anymore and just vaping to feel ""alert"" again. Also both substances make my heart race. I have such a love hate relationship with nicotine.

Due to these negative effects, I don't plan on using either substance long term but my life right now is rather turbulent and requires a lot of mental energy as I am working as a developer. I found microdosing LSD to be very helpful and perfect for me but I don't wanna keep taking acid like that. I prefer just doing large doses to trip. And I've tried Noopept and Piracetam (and Modafonil once) and I didn't really find them powerful enough to really get my head going the way nicotine and caffeine do. But I've only done oral doses of Noopept of 20mg so I'm gonna continue my experimentation with it since I keep hearing it is quite promising.

&amp;#x200B;

But going back to the main topic, which of the two substances are technically ""healthier"" overall? Is nicotine really that bad? I really just stopped using it because it felt ""wrong"" in a way.

9199,Methamphetamine,Meth is weird for me,"Had a coffee, heads up lol 

Alright, so yadda yadda yadda I have ADHD and 'tism. Been on stimulants since I was three. I have tried all pharma stims, excluding vyvanse cause that's newer. I get typical paradoxical reaction from them and have to take a fuck ton of any stimulant to get ""recreational "" effects. Took 120mg of Addy to overwhelm the lethargic feeling. 

I recently tried meth ""again"" because I couldn't pay for doctor bills and I did have a history of desoxyn when I was younger. I found it to be...underwhelming compared to the stigma around it. It literally was just smooth ass adderall and taking higher doses gives nothing more than more jitteriness.  

I found it to be very helpful for ADHD, and found that it helped ""tune"" me into my emotions. This is different from adderall because adderall numbs my emotions. Weirdly enough, after experimenting with high doses of meth I still crave the fuck out of adderall. It feels like I can get ""higher"" on adderall. I think this might be related to adderall being more noticeable of a high physically, but I dunno.

Another thing I've noticed is that meth doesn't make things super enjoyable or ruins sober sex. If anything, sex on meth makes me finish too fast and it's not nearly as compulsive as adderall sex.

9291,STRONG ass cannabis,"Almost got busted, thought lost my juul and tripped off weed last night","Tldr at bottom
Sorry if it's poorly written and Abit rambley, it's the Adderall

Yesterday was pretty normal, got out of day prison at 2 but had to wait around till 4 for my friend, let's call him ""Y""


We went out and met up with another friend, lets call him ""T"".


We got off the train at the stop near both of there houses.  Me and Y gave T the money to cop.  Me and Y went up to the 6th floor in one of the housing projects and sat down in the stairwell.


I took out a joint I had rolled up the previous night and my and Y smoked it in the stairwell.  


Me and Y sat there waiting for T when my other friend F and Z called Y and asked him where he was.  Y told them where and they showed up literally 5 minutes later.


T got back with my and Ys weed and we rolled another joint.  We smoked it without issue in the rotation.  


We sat there for afew more minutes before Y said, ""yo let's roll up more"".  So we did, .7gs from each of us, 1.4gs of 4 different strains mixed together, bubba kush, strawberry Kush, white rhino and the strain I just bought, I don't know what it is but it's gas.


We lit it up when we heard an apartment door open one floor down and a voice shouted up at us, ""yo T, the ops just came into the building you gotta be out!""


We put out the L, I put it in a preroll tube and we got up and walked down the stairs to the 5th floor because the 6th floor doesn't have an elevator.  


We hit the call button when 4 cops came up the stairwell.  They said, ""hey guys, what are you doing up here?  Just hanging out?"" T responded with, ""we were just seeing my friend"" they said, ""well whatever you're doing, just do it outside and don't come back.""


We stepped into the elevator and I pressed the door close button faster then I have ever before.


We almost ran out of the elevator when it got to the first floor because of how much we were panicking, we all had weed on us.


We walked afew blocks away when I got the urge to hit my juul.  I patted down my pocket to see if it was there, typically it's either upright on the very right or left sides or horizontal at the bottom of my pocket under my phone.  But I didn't feel it, I thrust my hand into my pocket but there want nothing there but my phone.  I started to panic, I checked my other pocket, just my keys and lighter.  Back pockets?  Nope just my wallet.  All the pockets in my 2 jackets and sweatshirt I'm wearing?  Nothing but eye drops and an empty preroll tube. 


I went over to T and asked him to call whoever warned us and ask them to look in the stairwell for it.  He did and after 10 minutes she called back and said she couldn't find it.  All of my friend were saying that the cops picked it up when they went up there, but that didn't matter, all that mattered was that my juul was gone.


We hung around for afew more minutes before getting back on the train and going afew stops away to meet up with more people.


We got off the train and saw afew people we knew across the platform.  We went over to them and went through the normal ""yo, whats good, what's the word"" convo.  They got in the next train so we left the station.


As we were walking up the steps out of the station I opened my bag to see if I had a sweater in it because it had gotten even colder when there I saw it, my juul sticking out of the top of one of my notebooks.  I have no idea how it got there.  Last time I had it, it was in my pocket on the left side so i thought it had fallen out when we left in a hurry.  I was so relieved.


We went to the Dunkin donuts to meet up with more people like we had planned.


We got to Dunkin and hung around for a bit before I remembered I had 5/6ths of a big joint left.


We went outside around the corner and smoked it.  After the cyph I had to go home and this is where the weed trip comes in.


As I was walking I started to focus all the small rises and dips on the path I was walking and then out of nowhere my vision goes very colorful for a brief moments and everything looked acidy for lack of a better term.  I started seeing faint color flash's in my peripheral vision and brief patterns dart across my field of vision.  Every so often my vision would to full acid trip minus the bright colors with the melting, twisting view of the world.  It would happen one second then be gone the next, like every time I blinked there was a chance that when I opened my eyes I would be seeing stuff


I got home and it just stopped and I felt normal stoned


I'm gonna guess it was HPPD, but my last trip was 2 months ago and it was only ≈80μg and 200-350mg DXM.  My first trip was maybe a year ago now but this trippy weed feeling felt almost identical to the HPPD I experienced after my first trip, not the second.  Also I was walking down the exact same path as I did on my first acid trip so it could have been a trigger, idk tho, it was a weird night.

9360,Stimulants,Personal Adderall for ADHD &amp; Depression Testimonial,"Hey dudes, I just wanted to post here to let anyone who's considering acquiring an Adderall prescription that it's absolutely worth it to try.

I grew up medicated with stimulants after being diagnosed with severe ADHD at the age of 4 (too damn young), so I've always hated stimulants and never enjoyed using them recreationally. I stopped taking them in the 8th grade once my behavioral characteristics of my diagnosis calmed to the point that I could get by in high school without meds.

In last year of high school I started getting severe periodic phases of depression. Antidepressants didn't work. After getting to university, huge course loads in classes I didn't enjoy whipped my ass and I started experiencing anxiety.

After some research and finding out that stimulants should be the primary method of treating depression in those diagnosed with ADHD, I decided to go to my physician and give Adderall a try after so many years off it. Immediately, I was put onto 25mg XR capsules and I immediately noticed a complete change in how I experienced life.

All of a sudden life feels less like a challenge and more like something to keep my adequately occupied by. I can focus properly now, I can actually eat on my meds, I can take naps on my meds, and I excel in my classes -- especially Chemistry and Calculus.

Also, NO DEPRESSION! But it's too soon to tell if it's solved my depression. Most of my depression was related to a negative outlook on life and an overwhelming feeling of underachievement. Now that I feel I'm being productive, I don't even feel an ounce of depression.

Bros and sisters, if you're someone with an ADHD mind or feel you're never being stimulated enough and it's affecting your life as adult, go try a stimulant and find something that works for you.

9600,I :love: Drugs,Am I... cured??,"I am so confused please help me yal. 
About 2 and a half years ago I was diagnosed with adhd via psychological evaluation, and given 20mg of dextro-amphetamine(adderall) for it. In elementary school through middle school I was often in trouble and very impulsive-it was very hard for me to sit still and not be a nuisance.  

Summer of 8th grade year I tried weed for the first time, then went on to use it about 5 times or more a month through freshman year, juuling very frequently too. Then, I was diagnosed and given the adderall prescription. It worked great and helped me to be able to sit still and listen to the teachers for once( I would never listen to what the teachers articulated, I got through with pretty good grades pretty much due to my subsequent intellect as well as cheating occasionally) Sophmore year( Present) I have been smoking about every day a week and juuling helllla, as well as some old fashioned fun with alchohol. 

The adderall worked great throughout freshman year( I would only ever use it during the school week)in fact it still does, but now so many problems are arising(last 2 weeks I’d say) from the use of it I just want to stop it immediately. Such problems like; Libido difficulties, difficulty sleeping, I have close to no appetite, it hurts to pee after fucking or masturbating, I have lost a lot of weight, and the comedown of the drug is absolutely horrible. The thing is, I now feel I am completely competent of sitting though long events( church, family dinners, etc.) with very little difficulty, whereas previously it would be utter torture.

Can someone please explain what is happening/ has happened to me??

I don’t want to give credit where credit is not due, but was it my consumption of these substances that helped me become the way I am now?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ae0occ/am_i_cured/

The Beatles, and Bill gates aswell have given it a try in their youth. Its always vague assumptions about what might happen. I am not saying that because x y and z did these that they didnt hurt their mental state, however when selecting for the most influential people these factors should limit them massively if it does stunt brain growth.

9646,Cannabis,Thunk I have weed induced Psychosis,"So my friends all used to smoke regularly but where I'm from they only smoke splifs (tobacco+weed) and I don't like the smell of tobacco so I never started smoking weed too.

My friends asked me to make a couple hits on their splifs multiple times on different days and I almost always accept to please them but never felt any effect at all.

One day I was with 2 of my to friends (we are always like 5/6 people when we meet) so there were less people to share the weed with meaning that time I smoked a lot more and I started feeling relaxed.

I started dancing with my eyes closed since I was feeling like no one was looking at me until I opened my eyes and realized both of my friends were looking at me and this started my horrible trip.

I thought:""why did I close my eyes and why was I feeling like no one was looking at me? Something is wrong in my brain"" this shit escalated really really fast I started shaking and talking really fast like a psycho because I was feeling detached with reality, I wasn't even looking at the people I was talking to.

I felt like I was completely out of control on my actions. Eventually this feeling finished like 4 hours later.

I smoked again 1 week later and the same happened, did it again the next week and the same happened again.

It's been 1 month since last time I smoked and I still feel detached from reality, I feel like I've no real power to decide about my life since everything is already written, I feel like I'm not really alive and I'm just some chemical reactions going on.

I'll just jump right in and explain what happened. Packed a raw paper cone, put on a record to listen to, and started puffing away. High was coming on nicely at first, but then after around my 8th inhale my heart started beating like crazy. I measured it that night and it clocked in at 114 BPM. I dont know if I was having a heart attack, or a panic attack because i felt this awful impending sense of doom all around my body. i felt cold, numb, and shaky everywhere. I could still walk, but not without my calves trembling, and whenever i would stand still my calves would tremble into a storm. I decided to wait the whole thing out, and just chalked it up to being too stoned. This was the worst experience ive ever had with bud and it made the whole high very uncomfortable. Ive smoked this strain of indica before a few nights ago, but nothing like this had happened. so by that notion im almost sure that it isn't spice and/or laced.

I posted this to TIFU a few years back; tried to provide context, but if you just want the actual NDE scroll down to where it says ""Things get murky..."". Ohh, and please don't eat Ketamine lotion.

&amp;#x200B;

The backstory: May 2012 I crushed my foot in a car wreck after three surgeries and two 6 week rounds of IV antibiotics it's as good as its gonna get. Fast forward to March 2014, my parents take me to my dad's podiatrist; he gives me prescription for a pain cream made by a compounding pharmacy (specifically ""combo pain cream 240 spec C23""). I receive 4 4 oz tubes in the mail a few weeks later; I wasn't impressed, the stuff leaves a sticky film, and it doesn't do much to alleviate my neuropathy or osteoarthritis, but it does contain a bunch of different do drugs, most notably Gabapentin, Soma &amp; Ketamine... Jackpot! xD), so I do some research on the interwebs and based off the best information I can find each tube contains around 10 grams of K; I eat approximately a quarter tube one of evening with no noticable effects (although I'd already been drinking), and so it sits in the medicine cabinet for the next 5 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 5 months to Oct 2014. My roommate gets us evicted from our apartment and I end up homeless (I come home on a Thursday night to find the power \[illegally\] shut off, Friday morning. I climb out of the window (garden level) to have the landlord verbally and physically assualt me on the sidewalk (he was old and looked liked he'd had AIDS since the eighties so I didn't fight back), so I decided to spend the rest of the day getting trashed. At the end of a long day filled with alcohol, dabs &amp; LSD I started coming down in the parking garage at my work (in my roommates car jamming Trae Tha Truth of course), I didn't particularly want to go back to the dark depressing apartment or my roommates office, but I needed to find somewhere to sleep so I start to take 'that' walk. I stop at the grocery store to buy some smokes and as I'm leaving I saw an acquaintance that lived in the apartments above all the restaurant I worked at, we'll call him David. David was heading into the grocery store to buy cigarettes as well, we ended up going back to his place to smoke a bowl. I'm in his bathroom taking a piss when his roommate get home, we'll call her Rosa, Rosa is also an acquaintance I've met separately, I greet her through the door and she busts into the bathroom with a metal carafe aimed at my head until she sees my face at which point we ditch Johnny to have hours of rough sex fueled by Jim Beam and some crystal meth I'd accidentally bought off a street kid earlier in the day while tripping face. So that pretty much summarizes the back story. I give Rosa that good dirck and end up shacking up which is great as she lives directly above my job; at that Rosa is batshit crazy and rarely home so I normally have a bed to myself. This goes on for 2-3 weeks until David and I arrive home late one night after work.

&amp;#x200B;

We're drinking and smoking some bud when we get into a discussion about drugs; he divulges that he used to smoke black tar heroin and I begin talking about research that has been done showing beneficial results of ketamine therapy. I end up retrieving a brand new tube from my suitcase and proceed to eat half of it. About a half hour later as it starts to kick in David follows suite. As the effects progress I begin to feel we made a mistake, I can hear music in my head; music I'd never heard before, like a jam orchestra, the music hit a sour not and started to get off key; my first clue that something was going awry. We're deeply in the K-hole at this point, observing life through a periscope, but through the fog I'm able too further research the combo 240 pain cream on my iPhun. I read something about preparation which says it should be 40% Ketamine by weight! Mind you we just split a 4 ounce tube. I try to express to David that we fucked up and needed too throw up &amp; possibly seek medical attention, but communication is breaking down at this point. I had some coke on me so, logically, I chop up a couple of lines to get us back on point. I do mine and try to get David off the couch to snort his, but he isn't moving. Realizing things are getting dire I try to make my way upstairs to alert one of the other roommates, but I just can't get there (picture Leo D in Wolf of Wallstreet after the Quaaludes kick in at the country club), so I crawl back to David and hug him as we're the last souls we'll know, and as we sat on the couch darkness set in. So that was like 5-6am, we both fade out. Rosa comes home around 2 in the afternoon to find both of us unresponsive, she calls 911, but not before punching us both in the face and stealing $230 out of David's wallet. Somehow I managed to rally when EMS showed up. The encounter went something like this: \[clumsily rouses from the couch\] ""who the fuck are yall?!"" ""We're EMTs, we're here to save you're life, lay down and chill the fuck out."" ""Ohh..."" \[collapses on the floor\] the last glimpse I have is being wheeled out on a stretcher (out through the parking garage entrance beside the restaurant I worked at) as the EMTs pumped air into my lungs with one of those squeeze bags. The thought crossed my mind as I stated up at the bright, partly cloudy sun-shiny sky ""well this isn't good"" then more darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

Things get murky after that; there was a lot of suffering, it seems like I experienced many painful &amp; scary deaths; burnings, beheadings mutilations. I kept dying over and over again until I was broken of my Will to exist. After that the the circular nature of the universe was revealed to me. The entirety of all that is, was, and ever will be from the God's eye view. How there's a universe within every atom, that our own universe is infinitely minuscule and is only a small body in some larger universe (kind of like the bag of marbles at the end of Men In Black) but that larger universe is only a small portion of some other universe, although it all comes full circle at some point and one of those ever larger universes is merely a particle in our own. It's all a Torus \[the Greeks almost had it right, buts it's not tortoises the whole way down, it's Tori (toruses not that slut from HS)\]. After this I found myself walking down a beach; desert on one side, ocean on the other. I was old, my skin dark &amp; leathery, long wiry white hair adorned my scalp and face. I was very tired, I didn't know where I had come from, I had no idea where I was going to. I was tired, very tired, and I couldn't think of a good reason to keep walking, so I decided to take a nap. I laid down on the beach and went to sleep. I could feel the warm sun above me, the damp warm sand below me. I felt myself go to sleep, I slipped into the warm, shimmery darkness of Nirvana. There was no sight, no sound, no thoughts, but I was still conscious to some degree. The only sensation to be had was the feeling of being swaddled in this feeling of unwanting love; the only thing I can compare it to was the feeling I got when I held my niece in the hospital when she was first born — that same feeling of love emanated from my heart. It was around this time that they hit me with the epinephrine. The first thing I remember was being with Jesus on the cross (I'm not particularly religious, I grew up Catholic, I'd call myself Buddhist if anything; if I believed in an afterlife it would be Nietzschian infinite recurrence) after hanging out with Jesus I came into an existence of excruciating pain &amp; sheer terror like I've never known. I thought I'd gone to hell, when the epinephrine hits your system, waking you back up, you wake to every cell in your body screaming for oxygen. It was horrendous; I didn't have any sensory perception outside of the immense pain and the color red. ""I should've listened to Mom &amp; Dad. I shoulda praised the lord Jesus &amp; now I'm going to burn in hell for all of eternity,"" I thought.  I tried to scream with all my might for help, but there was no air in my lungs to scream with, not even a vibration in my chest. I was also strapped to the gurney at this point (arms in a full Nelson position tied behind my head) and I was desperately struggling against this with all my might, in my mind at the time this was other souls dragging me into hell. Then they hit me with the defribillator; so top off the already immense pain and unbearable claustrophobia with a donkey kick to the chest. ""Fuck! to add insult to injury!"" I thought with a hint of irony. Then it dawned on me: there's no irony in hell, and I can't detach myself by thinking of my parents or other better times. That's when I heard the faint beep of the EKG. Remember that scene in Rick &amp; Morty where Rick fixes his time collar just as reality is about to completely break apart? Remember his reaction? That was me in that moment. ""Fuck you God!""

&amp;#x200B;

Around that time they pull the breathing tube; I finally gasp and am able to to draw a breath. I come to in the hospital; surround by nurses &amp; doctors EKG beeping (in a weird way that is a very reassuring sound). ""Hey there, do you know where you're at?"" ""A hospital."" ""Do you know why you're here?"" ""Cuz I fucked up."" ""What did you and you're friend take?"" ""Ketamine, it was ketamine."" I was wheezing out every word as I tried to catch my breath. \[stage left, enter DPD officer\]. ""Whose coke was that?!"" \[mind you I'm still gloriously fucked up, but at this point I at least have enough wits about me to not answer that honestly\]. ""Coke?! I don't know anything about any coke, all we did was eat the ketamine cream."" A torrent of murmurs floods the room as apparently no one had notice the busted open lotion bottle beside the cocaine on the counter. It didn't take long for me to fade out again, unaware, but at least alive. I came to the following morning, wrists still bound behind my head. Claustrophobia began to take hold, but there was nothing I could do; I could barely speak let alone scream for someone to loosen those god damn restraints, so I calmed myself down and waited for someone to notice me. I started knocking my right foot against the bed rail which made almost no noise either, but eventually I was able to get the attention of a nurse who agreed to untie one of my hands and get me some water, which was a relief to say the least. A neurologist came in and did some neurological tests (how many fingers, etc.) most of which I failed miserably. Then an admin came in to help me with Medicaid paperwork, so I could avoid paying for my fk up. They kicked me out of the hospital around 9-10am that morning (we ODed Weds. morning and it was now Fri; rather odd feeling losing a whole day). I tried to find David, but I didn't know his last name and apparently two guys coming in on an overdose at the same time isn't all that uncommon at Denver General, so I set my sights on the apartment to try to find more information. My shirt had been cut off, so I had to walk down the street one of those blue hospital gown shirts; also no shoes :/ As I'm leaving the hospital I check my pockets and find my wallet; mind you the entire time I was in the ER both the hospital officials and the police had been trying to get an ID on me, when EMS showed up they had pulled my pants down so they could subject me to a torture device known as an external catheter. Essentially it's a condom that is lined with medical tape adhesive on the inside; the thing is in an emergency situation where you're peeing your pants no one bothers to brush your pubes out of the way before applying it; it's about as far removed as possible from any sort of pleasurable experience when it comes time to remove it, which I did myself. Sorry to digress, so I find my wallet which had been in my pants, covered by a blanket the entire time \[at that I had an 'FTA' warrant out at the time, so I would've been fucked six ways from Sunday had I been IDed\]. Then I reach in my ""coke pocket"" (the small pocket located above the front right picket) and guess what?! The bag of coke was still there!!! Talk about \[not\] getting caught with your pants down!!! As for the aftermath pretty much everyone but David was mad at me (btw he survived, but had to be resuscitated as well); I ended up getting fired, losing my place to stay, that Saturday night my old roommate (the one who got us evicted) caught a DUI &amp; a POWPO, the following Tuesday I got mugged and got my wallet stolen. It was a dark fuckin period to say the least!!! Things are much better now, and to be completely honest it was one of the greatest experiences of my life, not one I'd like to repeat, but unapologetically amazing nonetheless. Also: I went back to the hospital to find David, after talking to the doctors it wasn't the Ketamine that killed us, but the massive amount of NSAIDS we had ingested along with it when we are the lotion. TL;DR A roommate &amp; myself overdosed after ingesting Ketamine lotion; we died, but for once in our lives we lived.",262,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ae29d9/couldnt_tell_you_what_happens_when_you_die_but/

His face is pretty fucked though; it’s completely red and all discolored and swollen; I was hurting just hearing how much pain he was in.  More pain than I’ve ever heard anyone ever endure by a long-shot,  his suffering in pure agony is now stained into my memory.

We didnt give many details besides sulfuric acid splashing all over his face, but these officers were constantly in there and then closed the door to fucking interrogate him, it’s like jesus he’s in the hospital just let him heal at least before you try to fuck with his head and get him to spill some shit.  It pisses me off.  Anyways, when the detective dyke cop showed up to talk to him i made arrangements to leave, as I was really not in the mood to be questioned about this shit especially after recently finally getting off of 2 past years of probation.

9898,Psychedelics,Can't seem to feel much emotion without alcohol,"I'll try to keep it short, but its hard

I've had this problem for a while, but I've seem to forgotten about it. Basically, I don't really seem to have the ability to have ""epiphanies"" it powerful emotional thoughts anymore, unless I'm drunk.

I am diagnosed with depression, the antidepressants seem to give a slight motivation to work (Wellbutrin) but do not help with this. Nor did 3 months of therapy (though I did have some interesting conversations about psychedelics)

I haven't drank in a while, but I have used marijuana and LSD. Marijuana used to make me get these meaningless epiphanies every minute kind of like ""shower thoughts"". LSD doesn't even do it for me, I've tripped twice recently (100 micrograms and 200 micrograms) and I felt happy and experienced awe at the beauty of nature, but emotionally I felt little too be honest.

It's a little depressing, I am drunk right now and I feel amazing. 

Now anyway I think I've tied it down to two reasons:

On March 1st 2018 I used my first psych, shrooms. 2g. It was similar to weed, but more epiphanies. I could never seen to remember them, But the prominent effects were after the trip. I was really thinking of disappearing and living in the wilderness, but around last May I lost all of this psychedelic motivation. Here's number two, dextromethorphan abuse. 

I was using dxm every 1-3 weeks, and I think this contributed to my lack of emotions. I'm early May I tripped on dxm and realized this- I stopped tripping then. I failed 9th grade and got into gardening. I've got an amazing (to me) ""natural space"". But I just can't feel emotions heavily without alcohol.

I feel somewhat happy with my space. But I feel very lonely, I pretty much talk to nobody at all. No friends really, just occasionally my pre-drug use friend group and random people who don't want to know me.

I've been thinking of killing myself in the next 2 years and accepting death using LSD, psilocybin, and possibly DMT.

I don't even know anymore. I know I'm not special. I just don't know anybody who is emotionally ready for me, much less wants to know me. I often feel like every one thinks I'm a school shooter or something (I think that violence is terrifying). But they give me the ""school shooter treatment"".

I'm just so sick of living so lonely like this. I likely live in the last years that gardening can exist, and I just want a real life friend who is into what I am. I don't know a single soul who appreciates and respects the natural world. I just need that. Please",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ae3e42/cant_seem_to_feel_much_emotion_without_alcohol/

10076,I :love: Drugs,Just because you aren’t “addicted” doesn’t mean you’re out of the clear! (Life story),"I got into drugs awhile back. Always used it to give me feelings in which wasn’t given to me from normal things, like human interaction, achievements, etc. Any type of drug would give me the feelings that I needed to maintain my sanity, which is why I haven’t ventured too deep into suicidal thoughts. 

This is in combo with my complete tolerance to drugs. Not chemical tolerance, I can still take the same amount of percs (for maybe a few days), but the mental calmness. I am able to adapt to certain mindsets, feelings, and habits that others might find impossible. I am completely flexible in my drug use, I can do depressants, stimulants, psychs, you name it (although I’m addictively sensitive to depressants).  I quite easily told myself, “well, the only way to use drugs and not get physically addicted to one is to get mentally dependent on ALL of them” which is in turn, true. 

At my worst times, worst depression, pains, whatever you may call it, I would smoke weed one day, do addy the next, switch to maybe another pill, and just do whatever was in my way. My “normal” drug use has usually consisted of a variety of Psychadelics like shrooms and weed, these would keep that mental dependency on the harder drugs under control. But when I got caught, everything was taken from me. My parents THOUGHT they were taking away weed, shrooms, and occasional semi-hard drugs(all they thought I did). They did not know that they were not only taking my therapy, but also taking the guards that kept the beasts at bay. 

Taking pot was more like re-buffing opiates. Re-buffing stimulants, dissociatives, etc. But they started drug testing, so these beasts now had no guards, and practically no government to keep them at bay. My lust for drug use went from therapy to hard on instant gratifications, a side effect of unleashing such a beast. The worst things that come from absolutely NO drug use is 1. Things like actual therapy, medication, and natural dopamine raises did NOT help me, and everyone’s only response back was, “Well they won’t help you instantly” or “just keep looking”. 2. The insatiable drug cravings. Not for one drug, but for fucking ANY. The lust to just get high usually lead to pure instant gratification mode. And usually ended in failure, such as turning the house upside down, or trying to get high off of fucking NyQuil or Listerine. 

Without ATLEAST Psychadelics, I’m growing more reclusive. I was actually beginning to become social when I smoked, even when not sober. Now I find myself curling into little blanket balls in my room, watching YouTube until 4 AM on a school night. Every time. I don’t go out, and my depression I feel is slowly returning. And that was a dark place.

1. There is nothing wrong with using things like psychedelics to keep your beasts at bay. You must not forget it. 
2. Just because you have been able to poly-use doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. The second everything is stripped from you, you’ll crave anything. And if everything except one is taken from you.... you’ll find yourself in rehab. ",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ae57co/just_because_you_arent_addicted_doesnt_mean_youre/

10096,Methamphetamine,Addicted To Meth,"So I'm already aware that I'm a meth addict. Been doing it off and on for about 8 months now, and it's progressively gotten more frequent and higher doses, with more days of use each time. 
After about 4 months of use I met the weirdest and saddest person I've ever met in my life. A 48 year old crossdressing meth addict in which I have stuck around in their life because 1) They get me high for free and provide a place to stay. 2) I kind of feel bad for the dude. His wife died a year ago, and he lost custody of his kids. Now he claims his old male self is dead and he dresses as a woman, and has gay sex with men frequently. Well, I've learned a few tips and tricks to doing meth and keeping my physical appearance upbeat and not looking like patient 0 to a zombie movie. 
First, I typically only go about 4-7 days awake with about a week of rest and then at least 3 or more sober days before my next stint. 
Second, every night while I'm tweeking, I will take some vitamins: 
1. One Daily Multivitamin
2. Rexall Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc.
3. 2 Tablets of Rexall Potassium 99mg
(Optional) 4. Rexall B-12 2500mg - Seeming as dope already increases energy and focus, I'm not sure why I take this one. 
Third, I brush my teeth at least 3 times a day, and use mouthwash to prevent my teeth from rotting as much as I can. 
Fourth, I drink plenty of water. At least 4-5 glasses a night and at least 2-3 during the day. Staying hydrated will help keep your gums from drying out and help prevent tooth decay, as well as prevent headaches from dehydration. 
Fifth, Do no more than half a gram each night. Maybe even less. I try to limit myself based on number of bowls, or lines depending on how I'm doing it because I'm not the one with the bag, the crossdresser is. /:
And last but not least, sixth, I try to not go out in public. Carry no drugs, no paraphernalia, and/or don't take anyone who can't handle their drugs with me. Staying in a house that little to nothing happens in, creates for a safe way to not get busted and catch unneeded charges. Also since I'm not the one buying it, I'm not taking the risk of carrying it on my person in public. Also staying in private areas gives less suspicion of being high and less chance of a PI. 
Not sure why I felt like sharing this, probably because I'm tweeking right now haha, but hopefully for any fellow tweekers, or anyone looking to do meth and you possibly get addicted, here's some tips on not being the after picture in a before and after anti meth ad. :)",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ae5oo8/addicted_to_meth/

10150,Long Post,"GUIDE : HBWR, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, LSA (Sublingual , Nausea Free)"," I’ve been lurking and learning for far too long and I want to give something back. After 20+ trips with HBWR I feel I should make a guide on how to take HBWR. Theres a lot I’d love to say about my trips but I have always felt like putting your trip into words is somehow never enough. 

Also I feel like any word I’d use here might incept an idea of what to expect.  A word on any other day is just a word but a word during a psychedelic trip is an entire world. Your mind finds a way to render everything and anything from a single word. I feel like a lot of trips reports give people this base idea of what to expect along with some images to expect and I think these images are why we see a lot of people seeing the same things on their experiences. 

On these Psychedelic trips

Words man they can really break you or make you 

So I’ll keep my mouth shut 

And let you explore it the way you want to.  :)

&amp;#x200B;

IMO, HBWR trips have been consistent with their EGO killing powers , I’d always suggest HBRW if ego death is what you are looking for. I have had ego death experiences on LSD and Mushrooms as well but something about the lack of apparent visuals(or a lower degree of visuals) in HBWR makes for a less distracting trip and a better conscious deep dive into yourself. That being said my last experience with LSD was my most profound and freeing yet.

I’ve tripped or a lot of different psychedelics constantly exploring myself and I want to give back to the community that made me a better person. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my guide to a Simple, Nausea-Free Guide to doing Hawaiian Baby Woodrose.

&amp;#x200B;

**What you need –** 

1) HBWR Seeds 

2) A Pocket Knife

3) 2 pieces of fresh Ginger (1sqcm)

4) 2-3 cloves of Garlic

5) Tablespoon of Honey

6) Empty Stomach 

7) A Bit of Dark Chocolate (Optional)

8) Fruit Juice (Optional) (I prefer Watermelon)

9) Some Weed

&amp;#x200B;

**How to –** 

1) Use the Pocket Knife to scrape the husk off the seeds.  You’ll find the outer husk to be brown/reddish brown/dark brown and once scraped they will be brownish yellow to cream and will have a smoother surface.(Keeping the husk generally increases the feeling of nausea and removing it has always made for a better experience)

&amp;#x200B;

2)  Chew and Swallow the Ginger and Garlic along with the table spoon of Honey. (The honey is to avoid a gag reflex which a lot of people have when eating raw ginger or garlic. The Ginger is to alleviate any nausea symptoms. The garlic to to keep vasoconstriction down.)

&amp;#x200B;

3) Pop the seeds into your mouth and keep them in your mouth for about 10-20 mins. Try to wash the seeds in your mouth with your saliva. Keep them soaked in your saliva for as long as you can. If you salivate a lot swallow little bits of saliva over time. After the 10-20 mins mark check to see if the seeds have softened , if they have chew them down and wash em a few more times and swallow it all. (This is a sublingual method and I’ve found this works a lot better than CWE(Cold water Extraction).)

&amp;#x200B;

4) There is a good chance that you can taste a nutty oil when you bite down on the seeds. Take a sip of your fruit juice to mask the taste and rinse and gulp it down.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Wait for about 20-30 mins meanwhile roll up some weed and spark up that joint. Snack on some dark chocolate now if you’d like. 

&amp;#x200B;

6) Start your music.  :) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Advisory-**

Unlike other psychedelics HBWR comes with some discomfort to most users either as nausea or stomach cramps or both. Don’t worry. There’s no need to panic, unlike any gastrointestinal problem you’d face on a sober day this stomach trouble will pass in about 30 mins to an hour after the come up. The ginger, garlic on an empty stomach is to alleviate this feeling. What helps the most with the nausea though is the weed. After this feeling has passed you’ll be in the most magical state. 

HBWR has been enjoyable both outdoors and indoors.

Although I’ve noticed, Indoor trips keep me more grounded to a single place and I usually lie down wherever I am, especially one the floor. Something about surrendering to the floor on HBWR feels amazing.  Bear with me, it feels like your body has stopped going against gravity so all the energy that would be spent doing that is instead forced into other parts of your brain accessing and processing a lot more data.  Look out for some amazing CEVs (Closed Eye Visuals) especially when lying down.

Outdoor HBWR trips have felt a lot more energetic and I usually feel the need to dance. Sunlight really highlights that HDR effect that they produce in your eyes. Everything you see will feel like they upped the quality of the image somehow.  Careful though, the vasoconstriction could be more for some people and might make it hard for them to walk around much. 

I generally keep an empty stomach during my trips and eat only after the 6 hour mark. This is the point where i feel like my taste buds have been refreshed and everything taste new and amazing. Theres a good chance you wont feel like eating till you are done with the trip but a few snacks wont hurt. Fruits are a better options though.  

Also **STAY HYDRATED.**

Music sounds amazing on HBWR and any sound in general especially the sounds of nature, auditory hallucinations are super apparent. After every dose of HBWR I always feel like the qualities of my headphones have improved. 

HBWR are a great way to start exploring Psychedelics because of their lack of visual hallucination. Especially for someone with anxiety issues and such. The small dose trips last about 6-8 hours and the larger doses go upto 10 hours.

You can always stretch out the trip with some weed if you wish.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Dosage –** 

Based on a person’s Body weight and previous psychedelic experiences I’d say 

Lvl1- Don’t hurt me! : 3-4 seeds

Lvl2- Bring em on! : 5-8 Seeds

Lvl3-Do or die! : 10-12 Seeds

Lvl 4- Call me Terror-Billy! : 15 Seeds

That being said all my experiments have been with the Indian Strain which despite what the internet says I have found to be an extremely potent strain.  There’s been multiple times I’ve had an intense trip on just 2 seeds as well. My go to dose is 5-6 seeds. And the most I’ve done is 12 seeds which was one of the most beautiful experiences in my life. 

I’ve also tried microdosing on HBWR But I’ve never gone for a dose smaller than 1 seed and 1 seed has some pretty nice effects. Very uppity, lot of energy and kind feels like a really strong sativa edible. It'll feel like a supercharged day.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Have a great Trip. :)",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ae6u0y/guide_hbwr_hawaiian_baby_woodrose_lsa_sublingual/

I also only had $20 bills and he had no change, So I gave him $10 extra and he said he would get me for $10 less on the next ounce (I've bought from this guy before). 

I sent him a pic of the scale that said 23, he gave an excuse that his guy gave him this short ounce and he just ran it over to me. No idea if this is true or not, but I doubt it. 

He told me he can't get me any more trees, just carts. Told him I don't want any carts, especially not just a single one so I told him he can just give me $30 for the 5 grams, and the $10 I gave him extra, so $40. He agreed and said he would give me that. 

Every day after that, he would snap me ""yo"" and then not reply. This happened once a day for about a week, until last night, when he blocked me. It's probably because I was a little bitchy about the money, but he was far more bitchy about returning shit to where it belongs. 

I don't know if it's even worth it to do anything about it, it's only $40 but this really pissed me off. I can't contact him anymore but my friends can - maybe they could ask him to chill and bring him to the garage we chill at and then I can confront him with some boys to back me up, but that's a lot for $40.

10316,Psychedelics,What neural networks does MDMA affect?,"Hello everyone, I am writing a research paper about psychedelics and their efficacy of treatment of mental illness. I already know the default mode network is the chief area that is affected when a classical psychedelic is taken. However, I do not know, nor have much knowledge about what neural networks are affected by the administration of MDMA. 

(I know MDMA is not chiefly a psychedelic, but does share some unique properties)

If anyone can send me sources or guide me in the right direction about what networks are affected by MDMA, or even other networks affected by psychedelics, that would be much appreciated!",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aea0fv/what_neural_networks_does_mdma_affect/
10333,Psychedelics,"Truffles, LSD or 2-CB?","TLDR: 100ug LSD, Truffles or under 20mg 2-CB for a first time experience?. I've read as much as I can about all these substances, just looking for fresh opinions for a first timer.

First time psychedelic? I really want to have an experience but I really don't know what to try, and I'm a bit scared to make the jump. I'm a 100kg 23yo Male. As far as I'm aware I have no medical/mental conditions. My experience: I'm a daily weed smoker (Anywhere between 3.5 to 7g a week), very occasional Cocaine user (even when I do it's just a few lines and bumps) and sometimes MDMA.

So firstly I've thought about maybe 50ug LSD but that seems too low/limboey so maybe start at 100ug, but I'm pretty nervous of being in an altered state as I have no idea what might arise and 10+ hours seems pretty hefty if I'm gonna have a bad time. Would most likely be doing it at the big park in my town and my best friends only live around the corner from there. Was thinking it would probably be best to wait till warmer weather before delving.

Then I thought about truffles as I am in Amsterdam for my 3rd time next month. Maybe 10g - 15g of fresh truffles? I hear psilocybes are similar experiences, and less lengthy than LSD but on the flipside I hear it's far more uncontrollable than LSD in terms of headspace. Would likely be either on Vondelpark or at my best friends mates house who lives in Utrecht. Would Winter affect being in nature whist high on truffles?

There's not many issues in my life, I have good friends and family but I'm just feeling a lil jaded and looking for new experience however I'd say my crippling credit card debt is probably the most foreboding and I also still dearly miss my ex-girlfriend despite me being in a completley good relationship right now and I'd hate to have a bad trip thinking about that.

So then finally I thought what about 2-CB? Acid like visuals and MDlike feelings appealed to me greatly, I hear it's very mild almost sober headspace but more intense trippier visuals, (in the 15-25mg range) which I'm not sure I could handle and Im feeling a lil sketchy about trying an RC. Not to mention it's the hardest to find for me but I know about onions 😉

Also, as a heavy smoker, would a few joints before, during and after any of these experiences have heavy impact? I hear weed can seriously amplify the effects for better or worse.

It took me forever to just get the courage to try Coke and MDMA. Now I don't get all the fuss about Coke but MDMA is beautiful and doing that is kinda what's got me curious about psychedelics.

Now I've typed all this out, I've realised that I legitimately don't know what I want out of having an experience. I just know that I want to do it.

I'm absolutely terrified of having a bad trip first time. I understand that ""bad trips"" are just learning experiences, but If one is going to happen, I'd rather it be after the first time and have at least a small first hand understanding of what the psychedelic headspace is like.

I've read some miracle stories of people who managed to change their lives around after just one psychedelic experience. I think about my weed habit and it kills me now much I spend but yet I can't (Or don't want to?) stop. And I've noticed my MDMA use has been creeping up on me. But then I think, why do I need a drug(s) to help/tell me to quit another one? 

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading. Just typing all this out has been quite nice to lay out my thoughts. 😊😊

So I just went through a break up and I asked my friend for a wax but hands over his vape and says it will get me high for 15 minutes, not thinking it would be that bad I took two long hits. I didn't feel it the first hit, took another one like 10 seconds later and after the second hit, I felt it. Everything started spinning, my friend told me the next day that I was tripping out. My eyes never got red while high before but my eyes where both blood shot red pink. I felt so uncomfortable and I saw shit. I mentioned earlier I just got over a break up. My ex lives 40 minutes away, but I saw her everywhere and it freaked me out. She would just stand there, giving me a mean look. Everything also kinda warped as I would say.

10450,Dissociatives,A first timers trip at 300mg on diphenhydramine ..,"Im 5'2 and quite skinny, got my hands on a box of dollar general brand  allegy pills.

DONT DO WHAT  I DID

being dumb , i took it before school,  so by the time i was there my body already felt heavy. 

my first hallucination that occured was a wavy..orb like sphere. it looked swirly and was kinda hard to see. it appeared on my school chromebook, and of course i poked at it and whatnot. 

I am in alterantive school so i go to school twice a week. the classroom is VERy quiet and we didnt switch classes, plus. my teacher donesnt care if we're on something hahah.
   anyway, i wouldnt call it an orb.  it  was more like a transparent -ish bacteria looking pile, except it was big. about the size of my palm. the orb stayed in front of the classrooms closet door, which is where my desk is across from.

i knew i was imagining it.  300 didnt make me delirious,  i was aware. and i hated it.  i curiously stared at the orb, and my brain decided that it shall shape into a bunny rabbit made of jelly-looking type stuff.

i was a bit scared, i you might be thinking that it sounds cute. but this was my first experience on psychs. (very dumb choice,  i know)
 the bunny began to run at me on fours, panic consumed me bc the bunny looked scary as fuck.
I quickly closed my eyes and turned away, drawing attention to myself. my classmates laughed, except for one girl.
she was my friend. 
and she sat next to me.
so, I asked her to tripsit me, and she happily agreed. i felt so much better once i told her what was going on, and she didnt mind at all. the bunny was gone now once i turned back around.

My heart was racing and i had to get out fast. before i could even try to stand, a LOUD ASS tv-static like buzz filled my ears for 2 seconds,  enough for me to jerk my hands over my ears and make everyone look at me.

dont do dph in public. i thought I could  remain cool, that shit is just spooky.  since im alternative, i get out of school  after 3 hours. well, 3 hours had passed and it was almost time to leave. i could barely text at all, the letters overlapped with a blue-ish tint. it was cool, but i really like to know what im typing  lol
---.
from here out i cant clearly  remember what happened,  i do know that the loud ass static sound appeared randomly.  luckily,  i looked sober and found out a way to walk normally. 

my cousin pulls up to pick me up,  and we go home. In the car, i keep spotting nats/black dots, that i repeatedly keep smashing. my cousin is obvlious though.  until i began to jerk everytime i heard that loud ass static noise.  sounded like ""PSSSSSSSHH"" but it was really short. it was enough to make me paranoid.
-
we're home and i tell my cousin, and she brings me water and goes to bed. how irresponsible.  i sit on the couch once im finally in and find comfort. with 300mg i didnt have a body load/extreme cotton mouth (didnt even need a whole bottle of water)
lucky me, huh? 300mg does cause nauesa, but its easy to ignore and isnt bad at all. it also  obviously,  gave me paranoia and hallucinations. 

I tried to relax, kept hearing noises. 

i tried to close my eyes, but the closed eyed visuals were too strange for me. it was like i was looking at blood and veins. which is gross, and i probably did look at that lol

did i see spiders? no.
centipedes? no.
top hat dude? no.
shadow figures? no.
did my reflection scare me? no.
----
ill  tell you what, those little bateria looking orb things, i could summon them by staring at a blank wall. they would slowly form, and if i thought of a unicorn, a tiny little translucent unicorn would start jogging in place. but it doesn't listen to me long.  because it suddenly began to rapidly grow. it looked like a hella bunch of  tentacles , yet it was growing so fast and rapidly. unbelievable. wasnt even cool, i got up fast and closed my eyes. 
it went away once i looked back though. 
i sat on the couch paranoid for a really long time, and had no one to talk to. &lt;:)

overall,  it sucked dick. i felt heavy and paranoid/scared as fuck. stay away from benadryl kiddies.
my trip ended and I still forget literally everything i try to say hahaha

trip safe. dph isnt fun. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aebh39/a_first_timers_trip_at_300mg_on_diphenhydramine/
10496,Long Post,Calling all parents of r/drugs,"Sup peeps, I'm at a point in my life where I want to have children in the next few years, and I know I am going to have to change my relationship with drugs forever. I don’t want to continue using drugs if it will have any negative impact on my children's life, but I don’t know where to draw the line. I would like to hear experiences and opinions of those of you who have been through this or have at least paid it a little thought, if you would care to share, I'd love to hear your take on it.

I'd like to open up conversation about how having children has changed your own drug use, how your drug use may have potentially affected them and how to go about educating them about this super complicated and potentially dangerous aspect of life. Alternatively, if your childhood was effected by drugs in any way and you feel comfortable talking about it maybe we could all learn from those mistakes.

From here on out is a little (looong) backstory on how I feel about these questions right now and why, if you're not interested in that but think you have something to share please just ignore the waffle and share away.

--------

I grew up living with my alcoholic mother and my father who had a long battle with heroin and crack addiction, so I feel my understanding of these things is a little different to most people. I fear this may askew my perception of what it's like to grow up without witnessing such a destructive disease and the effect it has on families up close, so I would like to know how people from all sorts of backgrounds feel about it.

 I don't think having children would change my current drug usage that much as it stands right now. The drugs I use the most frequently are weed and alcohol, in recent times almost exclusively only at the weekends. I have definitely abused both of them in the past but never to the point that I let it affect my career, relationships or responsibilities. After finding the benefits of moderating my usage, I feel using these substances only on weekends, after the children have gone to sleep would be responsible enough to not impact them in any way. Do you think that a fair assessment? Please chime in if not.

I am very cautious with my use of harder drugs but I do use MDMA, ketamine, amphetamine, lean and benzos (only as landing gear for the stims). These doses are usually months apart (at least 3 for MDMA) and never more than one day in a row. I've done a lot of research on dosages and combinations and I always test my shit before ingesting it. I feel this usage would definitely change after becoming a parent as never want to take any of these substances with children in the house. . Maybe if the children were with their grandparents for the night I could kick back? I don't know. Honestly the thought of being blasted off on cloud 9 having the greatest night ever and then getting a call to say something had happened to them and rushing to the hospital, or ODing on something laced with fent and them growing up thinking they don't have a Dad anymore because he loved drugs more than them? I can't get that feeling out of my head, no matter how slim the odds are or how much harm reduction I practice I don't think I could chance that happening for the sake of a night of bliss every now and then. I guess I'll only know once I'm there, but for now it scares the shit out of me. Can anyone else relate? I don’t understand how some couples can both shoot up at the same time while their kids asleep in the next room, not knowing if their children are going to wake up in the morning with their parents to greet them or to just find their corpses. I do understand why people can do it, addiction is one hell of a disease but I don't understand how the love of a drug could trump the love of a dependent child. I guess that makes me lucky.

Moving on to my thoughts about educating children about drugs, things get a little more conflicted. Despite my parents' own mistakes with substance abuse, I am really grateful for the way they treated my interest in altered states from a young age. When I became a teen and all my peers began experimenting, getting their hands on alcohol any way they could and drinking in parks and on the streets, I expressed my intrigue to my parents. They had always ensured that I knew I could come to them with this kind of stuff from a young age and I am so grateful for that. Their reaction was to buy a case of cider and allow me to have a couple friends stay over and find out what it was all about in the safety of our home, where they knew we'd be safe and they could keep an eye on us. When I was 14 and they found out me and my girlfriend were talking about sex they didn’t chastise me, they made sure I understood the consequences of not being safe and made sure I had access to condoms. When I was 15 I told my Mum I was thinking about trying weed and the next week she went out and got a bag and sat with me while I smoked it in the front room. My Dad even went as far as to say that despite all I had seen and all he had taught me about the evils of crack and heroin, he made me promise that if I was determined to do any of that shit, I would come to him first. And he promised me that if he found out that I had done it elsewhere he would kill me. His logic was if I was hell bent on doing it, he wanted to know where it was coming from and that I wasn't going to hurt myself in the process. Would he have sat there and cooked up for me? I highly doubt it, but I know if I had actually asked he would have talked/scared me out of it anyway.

Some people I have told about this have recoiled in horror, and stated that my parents were wrong to encourage a 13-year-old to drink, and to supply the alcohol and venue is utterly reprehensible. “And to encourage an underage child to have sex is disgusting!”. I feel they are missing the point. I understand their concern, and the fact that it is coming from a good place, but I whole heartedly disagree. They see it as encouraging your kids to do drugs and have sex when they are way too young, they think you should just say no and simply pray they heed your advice. But we all know what happens when you tell kids they can't do something. They just want to do it more, and the more you freak out and try and stop them the more they rebel. I feel showing your children enough respect so that they feel comfortable enough to come to you about anything and know they won't be judged, answering their queries and providing them with enough reliable information is your duty. I am less certain that allowing them to safely experience things of such consequence in an environment where they are under adult supervision is the best way to teach them how to be responsible about it now and as they grow up. I’m sure plenty of you agree and disagree with this for a multitude of reasons, please feel free to share your POV if you will.

What concerns me when considering extending this approach to my own children is that I know they will grow up in a vastly different environment to the one that shaped me. I knew I sure as hell didn’t want to grow up to become a slave to addiction because I saw what it did to my family day in day out for years on end. I could never put my kids through that. It’s no life for anyone, let alone an innocent child. I unashamedly love my drugs but I will never let that love jeopardise any aspect of the rest of my life. I don’t know if it is possible to show my children the extent of how destructive substance abuse and addiction can be without them experiencing it for themselves like I did, which makes me scared that I could do more harm than good by not keeping them away from them as long as I can. Then again there are plenty of people that grew up around addiction the same way I did and went the complete opposite way and made the same mistakes as their parents. Despite the best nurture you can provide I believe nature has a lot to do with the choices people make and the thought of being responsible for another life that I can’t reason with scares the living shit out of me.

That was a lot longer than it was meant to be, but it sums up where I am about it all right now pretty well. Kudos if you got this far lol

Anyone care to share their own musings?

10555,Stimulants,How overcoming the worst comedown I've ever had from taking a stupidly high dose of ecstasy seemingly cured my depression,"Me and my friend were going to a rave and we acquired two ecstacy pills supposedly containing 200 mg of MDMA each, the plan was to split one and save tho other for another day. Friend leaves early and I'm left with the extra pill by myself. Tend to lose self control while high so I think 'fuck it why not take half of the other pill aswell?' and I take half of it. About an hour later I remember that I had the half of a pill left and thought to myself 'might aswell' and I proceeded to take the remaining half.

At this point some uncertain amount (supposedly 300mg) of MDMA and other shit that these pills could have been cut with is flowing through my veins and I'm having the most intense roll I've ever had. I'm full on hallucinating various lines and stuff, my vision is zooming out when I focus on things and I'm all in all  having a pretty good time. After however many hours I was dancing there I decide to finish the night off with some Nitrous and then I decide to head home. 

Waking up the next day I obviously feel really tired and worn out and I also notice that the inside of my mouth is riddled with sores and loose skin from the gurning while high from yesterday. I didn't really notice that my mood was noteworthly bad because I was basically half asleep the entire day and spent most of it playing video games. 

The second day however was a completely different story. The whole day my train of thought was just completely slowed to a halt and I felt the most overwhelming sense of dread I've ever felt on the inside. I was in school and I didn't speak at all unless provoked to do so which is totally out of the ordinary for me because I'm normally very talkative. I was used to being sad and feeling worthless whenever I was by myself but this was like nothing I've ever felt before. Safe to say I contemplated suicide during this comedown period but thankfully I didn't act out on it. This continued the next day but as the next day was coming to a close I slowly started to regain some sense of comfort and ability to socialize. 

At around 11 pm the same day however, was when something strange happened. I was just sitting around, probably procrastinating when all of the sudden I felt as if the rainstorm that was in my head cleared to sunshine and I from out of nowhere just got this compelling feeling that I was fine and that everything else was fine. I had experienced sudden bursts of good mood while in a slump before but so I didn't think too much of it and I just hoped that my mood would go back to normal the next day. The next day came and I felt awesome. Bright thoughts, an appreciation for life and a relief that the comedown was over, I didn't even have the negative thoughts that I used to have 99% of the time when alone with just my thoughts.

Fast forward about a week and I realize that ever since I came back from the comedown I've had almost no negative thoughts when alone with my brain and my overall mood has been pretty good. I had recalled feeling the usual bombardment of anxiety that school and life delivers but no compelling sadness that I had felt on the regular for the past 2 years. This was kinda freaking me out because I believed that if my depression could just go away just like that it could come back just as easy.

This was about 3 months ago and my mood these past 3 months has been so much better than it has been the past 2 years and the negative thoughts do appear from time to time but not nearly as often as they usually did. My lifestyle is the exact same as it has been but everything just hurts less now then what it used to. 

I feel like whatever part of my brain responsible for regular dopamine/serotonin flow got overloaded and broke down for a while only to later get reset and function much better than before, don't know if this has any scientific accuracy but it's how I visualize what has happened.

TL;DR: I took a dangerously high dose of ecstacy which lead to me having the most devastating comedown of my life. After I recovered from it a lot of depressive thoughts and mood problems I've had been having for about 2 years seemingly dissapeared and I still feel happy and content to this day.

10580,Cannabinoids,Banished my brain fog! (Stoners read below),"I smoke cannabis almost everyday, if it’s not during the actual day because I have something to do I usually have a nighttime smoke. 

Now, everyone knows the brain fog associated with weed. You wake up and your brain feels like oatmeal. You’ve tried vitamin B’s (if you haven’t this is probably a cause) and you’ve tried other things with no luck. Well here’s why. 

When you are deficient in choline your brain barely can synthesize enough acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is interesting because it forms memories and works with muscle twitches.

And if you smoke weed, and worse tobacco and even worse- mixing. Your guaranteed to be deficient in choline and inositol. 

So why is acetylcholine important? Again, it helps the brain with memories. Cannabis will directly block acetylcholine neurons while elevating certain areas of the brain with them. 
Nicotine directly mimic’s the shape and fit of acetylcholine- if your mixing them then your creating a chemical cocktail of dopamine in the brain, despite cannabis’ direct release of serotonin. When dopamine levels in the brain elevate, serotonin naturally lower and vice versa.

So when your mixing some weed and backy remember, your interrupting natural acetylcholine levels. But even more so if you smoke tobacco with your weed then your not only stopping acetylcholine your also replacing it. Now nicotine with weed does improve memory. But so does giving your body a chance to naturally help itself. Supplement with choline today! 

Edit: tobacco also has an maoi effect on the brain further raising dopamine levels then plain nicotine. 

Update: the type of choline you would want to take is CDP choline",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aeco98/banished_my_brain_fog_stoners_read_below/
10614,Cannabis,Really weird effect while high on weed. (Kinda high report?),"So this was a good month or two ago.
I hadn't smoked in about a month so my tolerance should have been reset.
I stuffed as much as I could into one blunt and smoked it. I was fucked before I could even finish it.

Anyways about half a hour later Im chilling on the sofa. My cheeks go really hot and then I start getting a vibrating feeling in the top of my head. It's really hard to explain but it was like a wooshing feeling of ether a metal ball rolling around in a circle or helicopter blades wooshing through the air.
Pretty much I just gave into this feeling as it was pretty amazing. And every muscle in my body even ones I didnt know I could relax just went limp. As I shut my eyes and experienced this feeling of bliss.
Anyways that was ruined when my dad came home early from work who is anti drugs (I'm 20 just don't want conflict so I hide any drug use). 
So I went to my bedroom and slept.

Although I've never tried any phsicodelic substance I seem to have effects similar to what I hear people have when they do those substances.

10723,Long Post,NBome heroic dosage (14mg),"So this is a story from a close psychonaut of mine what happened coming up four year ago, he isn’t on reddit so I thought I’d share this as it’s just baffling how he’s still alive seriously. 

Anyway back then real acid was none existent where we lived so 25i was getting sold as real acid and since we were all stupid none of us done our research properly, especially not my friend as you will come to learn. 

He used to trip in his own settlement he’s two year older than me and had a different setting of folks who he tripped with, my pals only ever went up to two tabs of 25i and half the time you’d take one and get the same result as two as they were poorly dosed. 

This dude was selling em £2.50 a tab so me and the boys could get a memory out of a tenna, it was actually really fun till we done a bit research we always had a feeling it wasn’t right, the price. But everytime we questioned he’d tell us the tabs weren’t ‘profitable’ just for people’s pleasure (sketchy dealer) 

Anyhow my friend who was tripping with his own boys was oblivious to what he was doing, where we live we have an annual air show which attracts LOTS of people to watch a load of boring airplanes. For young folk though it was great to go down and get shit faced, for me it was never a biggie but this one year my pal went and done a fucking biggie. I mean big biggie. 

He picks up 14 tabs of NBome I Shit you not, the story has been told to me by others to because it’s just nuts as how he’s still here. So anyway he drops the entire strip as one everyone was saying you are fucking crazy yet he is the gamest folk I’ve come across, I mean he’d ride a tsunami if possible a 5’7 machine. 

Heads down to the air show he tells me how with low dose NBome the body feel is dirty and uncomfortable which it is and always was in my time a really weird feel, somehow the higher dose removed this he said the comeup was literally ten minutes if that and he started to feel it. 

So he heads down and on the way there’s a corn field and he said everything turned to pure petrol geometry he said the corns looked fucking amazing, the guy he was down with who was trip sitting was keep telling him to hurry the fuck (he’d been staring in this field for over an hour) 
not been able to move he was sat amongst it in pure awe. 
 
When they finally make it to the air show the amount of people makes him go nuts, I’m sure he was drinking vodka too which really doesn’t help and start believing people were chasing him so he was frantically running about everywhere which lasted a good while. 

All this running about caused him to get sweaty as fuck like literally dripping so he’s in some bushes , basically we live next to a coastline and behind the beach there’s shops then further back a huge field which everyone got shit faced on. The airplanes all fly over the sea and get close down on the beach so all the tourist attracts tend to stay there and along the road covering the entire coast line away from all the shit faced people. 

He’s in this bush next to the field and he frantically takes all his clothes off, and I mean not just the top and bottom the fucking keggs his socks cock out the full wham. And he still thinks he’s being chased so out he runs from this bush oblivious to the hundreds if not thousands of people on this field and he’s lit running about in the mist of it all he didn’t even realise there was people till he got away from the field his sitter chased him and told him to get his clothes on and as they in the distance he turns to the crowds of people in hysterics I mean at this point I dunno what the fuck I’d do. I asked what he thought was chasing him and he still hasn’t a clue just the nature of the high made him go complete ape shit, and when he was running it felt amazing the energy was surreal but obviously he lost the concept of people being everywhere. His vision was bathed in so much depth he couldn’t see where he was going ended up bumping into people running frantically at them I mean as a spectator you’d just be fucking speechless. 

So he’s fucked for hours doing loads of silly shit, and a police officer notices him going on crazy so asks him what’s happening in the frantic panic he slaps the officer clean across the tash and gets straight locked up. This is where he said everything came crashing it was literally like watching a plane just cruising then suddenly nose diving into a utter carnage which was good narrative since it was an airshow. 

Anyhow he’s in the station it took them ages to get information from him he’s laughing hysterically at the officers as if they are talking Swahili so they make him get the jail clothes on and put him in the cell and at this point he’s pants were still on the field he’d put his boxers back on but the pants...long gone. 

In the station the cold reality swept him, he said it went from being lovely and this unreal surreality to just awful absolutely awful vibes. With it been bang in the middle of summer being outside on 25i was sweet as fuck I miss those days personally even though I’d not touch it again, rather drink my own piss. 

Since he’s in this close occupational space which is not a nice setting at all he starts doing crazy shit like singing loads of random songs at the top of his voice for hours and weird sorceress hand moves playing with the visuals as he said,  the camera in the cell he was in the guy notices and gets face up with it rambling on about a fierce select of conspiracies then he proceeded to do sit ups and press ups and got caught in a loop he told me he ended up doing easily over 500 no problem I mean at this point I’m lit like wtf do I even say to this guy. 

When the morning came round his gran came and picked him up and he said her face was disfigured and shit whilst they drove to McDonald’s everyone in public looked fucked up on a different degree of messed up, his gran didn’t even say a word apparently other than asking what he wanted from maccies. He’d been kicked out the house his parents straight told him to not come so his granny took him in. 

He got in and then it kicked in the nasty side effects, he was sick for 3 weeks not spewing sick just complete bed ridden fucked up kind and everything made 0 sense his mind was just pure scrabbled to nothingness the visuals lasted for near 2 days gradually dimming and considering a usual 25i trip puts you in for about 5/6 hours from personal use that’s a long long time under the stuff. HPPD came as a result which he said only dimmed surprisingly when I introduced him to genuine LSD. 

And even worse he couldn’t get erect for months to the point he had to see a doc about it and some viagras had to sort him out. Pissing was difficult too as if he had kidney failure to some degree he said it was just a really uncomfortable period of time he believed he was total fried, a lot of people seen his nude episode so things were a bit interesting to say the least. 

So all in all pretty fucking wild folk and he is now a very fond user of real lucy and has taken 1000ug doses as well as doing eye dropper and mixed highs with e, shrooms , 2c , coke and he still told me the peak of the NBome trip was the highest of highest he ever felt in that nothing has ever topped that not even close. 
He even said the headspace was really active which it usually isn’t even existent in standard dose. 

A big reason for his high lucy dosing was to achieve something close but it just never matched. 

For anyone who’s done 25i you know this is crazy stuff he’s lucky to be alive in a huge sense, the visuals from 25i are really hard to explain it’s very drippy super bright colourful visuals it’s like putting this funky visor on the geometry is weird it’s not natural if that makes any sense. Lucy is more sacred lavish geometry just a total 
different kettle of fish. 

And Btw nobody ever try this, life threatening shit once you hit 4000mg with nbome your at risk of harming yourself seriously. 
On that note hope you enjoyed that read:) happy tripping people. Peace

10729,GABAergics,Xanax. A drug I love to hate.,"To introduce for contextual purposes, I created a post awhile back about my opinion of Xanax. 

To get the just of it, I thought Xanax was not something to appealing to me and pointless, and I would like to express my current thoughts regarding it.

I knew Xanax were a thing in my hometown. I've also seen exactly what it did to my friends. I've been on SSRIs for a few years now for anxiety and I never thought i would ever take Xanax as I assumed I'd get addicted. Well a time period of drinking to excess among other stressors took its toll and I had my first panic attack. For those who have never had a panic attack, count yourself lucky.  It starts as a general feeling of uneasiness and slowly escalates with racing thoughts. Subjectively, I can feel my entire body start feeling briefly numb as I know what's down this road. Then nothing feels real and all you can do is shake and hope for the best. 

Now this is where Xanax comes into play.  Xanax provides an almost instant relief in anxiety but also acts somewhat as a shut off valve for my emotions. At first i didn't even like them, until I had to take them again. It felt similar to being drunk although without a lot of stumbling, but as in foggy headedness. 

Xanax helped me personally quite a bit, but please be careful when using this. The most difficult part now is knowing in your mind that an instant snap of relief and paradise is only a pill away. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aee41p/xanax_a_drug_i_love_to_hate/

10947,Stimulants,Post stim use and welbutrin,"Past stim abusers- what antidepressant/meds ACTUALLY helped you? 

Brief history of when I was using.
Coke was my shit, never could do one line and be done. It was always at LEAST a 4 hour long session, by myself. Got slipped some meth as coke, but I just have this deep psychological addiction to coke that I threw it out. Tried to get clean like 3 times, relapses were usually a weekish long and were hard, I mean hard. I'm a college student and I relapsed finals week and I couldn't get up every 10 minutes to rail shit so I'd load my lip and dumped some coke in my white rockstar nd sipped on that shit. I couldn't go 20 minutes without a line. Longest I've been clean from coke is this time around, a month and some change. Last relapse was absolute dogshit and almost started banging my shit cause I couldn't get enough. I didn't though, im glad.

Christmas day, rail 20mg adderall, 30 min later 100mg mdma, hour later 100mg mdma (don't suggest that cause it feels like meth, and that shit feels awesome when you accidentally do a coke sized line of it). Gave myself mild serotonin syndrome, I thought I was gonna die or some shit the next day and day after, was the worst experience ever, enough to make me stop stims, and everything tbh altogether. Except lsd and shrooms.

I take 100mg welbutrin, been taking for like 6 months. I take it every day (except for the days I would use) and I don't know if I should up the dosage or get a new antidepressant altogether.

 Past week my episodes have been horrible. Wanting to cut my stomach open and tear out all my guts and all that usual shit, and I mean actually wanting to, basically foaming at the fuckin mouth. I'm driving my car at night and I have to talk myself out of hammering it and rolling the car. I don't even smoke pot anymore, makes me feel super depressed and when I'm stoned I just feel like using. 

By the way, I was prescribed 100mg welbutrin BEFORE any drug use. Was on zoloft for 2 years prior. SSRIs stopped working for me.

Whats helped you, past stim abusers? Should I wait it out longer until I up my dosage? ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aefvv7/post_stim_use_and_welbutrin/
10952,Psychedelics,My conclusions after 25 acid trips during summer 16’,"At the end of my sophomore year of high school I took LSD for the first time with one of my closest LSD partners J. We each took around 300 Micrograms, my most vivid memory from this trip was looking into the tile floors of the evicted house we tripped in and seeing a seemingly infinite expanse of clouds extending down into the floor below me as well as blue pumping veins running throughout the surface of the floor. 

After my first trip I proceeded to trip 24 more times, not including my 4 experiences with lab grown golden teachers and megadosing DXM. The quality of my trips lowered with each usage, likely because I did not space out my uses properly and had depleted my serotonin levels unnecessarily. 

One of my last trips showed me the two extremes of LSD, unbelievable euphoria, and soul rending paranoia and anxiety.  This euphoria was brought on by Chance the Rapper’s Acid Rap album. The terrible paranoia I experienced was induced by my decision to stare at one of my friends, G, who has unfortunately had to battle obesity his whole life and was in bad health at the time of this trip, as I looked at him floating on a giant blow up orange slice on the tranquil pool surface, I began to believe that he was turning purple and asphyxiating. I looked to other people around me to assure me that this wasn’t happening but I didn’t actually tell them what was going through my mind in an attempt to avoid ruining their good vibes, I followed this line of thinking while peaking and I remember being able to see the coroner zipping up G in an extra large body bag in my minds eye, this brought me the most intense anxiety and paranoia I have ever experienced. I ended up jumping into the pool and frantically swimming towards him only to find that he was completely fine atop the pool float. I was eventually able to mellow out again although my anxiety could not completely abate.

CONCLUSIONS: After my 25th trip I finally decided to retire from psychedelic use as my last 7-8 trips were all ultimately negative experiences. After I stopped, for about a year I was secretly suffering from a dissociative personality disorder. I met my girlfriend of 2 years during this period and with her support I have been able to recover almost completely from the mental state I put myself into, although I don’t believe I will ever truly return to who I was before. But I, along with the 6 other people I went on my odyssey of LSD with, have all discussed and reached conclusions that we now accept as true facts of life and the universe. People who have never done LSD truly cannot understand or appreciate the world in the way someone who has experienced LSD can. I gained a tremendous love and connection to our planet and all life on it after these experiences. I have found that I can’t develop, or have trouble developing, meaningful connections with people who have not used LSD. I have also come to the conclusion that nearly all people are truly good, although many wear a mask to protect themselves from their pasts and that mask can be quite ugly, thus giving the illusion of badpersonness. I would say that the main thing I gained from LSD use is a greatly increased understanding of other people’s burdens and motivations as well as an  understanding of social concepts I couldn’t grasp before my experiences.

A huge thank you to anyone who read to this point. I would love to know about if any of you have had any similar experiences with extreme paranoia while tripping and any conclusions about the world and people you’ve reached after tripping.

TL;DR 
Using tons of acid led me into a damaged mental state but I’ve now recovered and have a greatly increased appreciation for all things in this world.",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aefws4/my_conclusions_after_25_acid_trips_during_summer/
11018,Rant,"Addicts are people, too, and I‘m sick of being treated as anything less.","Last month, I took too much MDMA (might have been cut with meth) and ended up being high for 5 days straight. I was extremely paranoid and anxious during this time, and consistently on the verge of a panic attack. I didn’t sleep at all for 3 of those days, and decided that I wanted to go to the ER to get everything flushed out of my system quicker. I didn’t know what else to do, and I was too high to completely understand the situation I was in. I just knew that I needed some sort of help, and it seemed like my best shot.

I’ll try to keep this short, but in the ER, some of the nurses and doctors thought it would be acceptable to make comments about how they purposely treat patients poorly when coming in for drug related emergencies. I was already paranoid out of my mind and had earlier told them in a calm and polite manner that I was terrified of needles, but they proceeded to joke about how they always go for the “thickest” needle when people like me come in so they can “teach them a lesson.” Needles have been a deep rooted fear of mine since I was a small child, and I didn’t appreciate the hospital staff manipulating that fear simply to prove a point. When they took my IV out, they wiggled it around way too much and fucked up my vein for no reason at all. In addition to the reckless attitudes, I was also talked down to the entire time and spoken to as if I were a child.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think that it’s the doctors or nurses job to judge me. I am already paying them an excessive amount of money and am doing so for them to keep me healthy, not to scare me into never coming back to a hospital ever again. I’m sure that none of the staff thought that the comments were a big deal, and it may sound to some of you like I’m just being dramatic, but when your health depends on someone who seems to have little respect for you, or for anyone suffering through addiction, it can be terrifying to not know wether or not they are on your side. All and all, I’m tired of being treated like garbage because of a choice that I am willing to pay for. Taking potentially dangerous substances, wether it is a smart decision or not, is my choice, and my choice only. Your lack of support for the choice that I’ve made does not give you the right to take advantage of me in my worst state. It just makes you a shitty person.

EDIT: (1/10/19 1:41pm) Due to the skepticism of my claims from people suggesting that I may have been too impaired to understand what was actually happening, I asked the sober mind who was in the hospital room with me if there was anything untrue about what I said. They confirmed that all of my claims were indeed true, however, I feel that it would be dishonest of me to not specify that the comments were not directed towards me. The comments were still a scare tactic none the less, as I was extremely frightened and paranoid, and they saw this as an opportunity to tell me about all the terrible things they do to drug addicts. There’s not really another way to spin it. At least to a certain extent, they were taking advantage of my fear. 

As far as the IV, I was also told by said person that they actually gave me the smallest needle they had for the IV, so they might have just been trying to freak me out by talking about the “bigger” one. The wiggling it around to get it out definitely happened though, and freaked me the fuck out. There’s obviously no way for me to prove if that was intentional or not, though I personally believe it was intentional due to their comments about how careless they are with patients “like me.”",1906,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aegibv/addicts_are_people_too_and_im_sick_of_being/

Some chill white stereotypical hippie chick and scored some drop. I went over tk her house and took two drips have in mind these didn't feel like drips it felt as if she squirted a mouthful in me the 2nd time.

So its almost if i regain some sense of my reality but still feel up and connected with everything

Next day i had a happy high smoked a few bowls after id been sober for more than half the day which is a big thing for me lol. Almost felt as if i felt things would work out 

During the months after that trip i would see shit feel shit what i thought as higher beings i thought God was coming and Mr. President was the anti Christ( no i dont anymore to a certain extent ;) ) i kept thinking i was a target( i lived in a bad neighborhood at the time) 
Also felt like an untouchable and uncareless *which is alot for a person with social anxiety and all that other good stuff * like no one coulf fw me or wanted to until
I almost got jumped by some tweaker ass cholos

The next incident i had i just took hulk xans blacked out and it looked as if i was oding in front of my fam they didnt like it kicked me to the curb was homeless for a while 
Thats just some of the stuff that happened before i started motivating myself tl get better which i am *barely started taking yellow bars every now and then not that that's any better but I don't abuse half is enough to chill*

I feel like me not being able to handle or accept the outcome or work with it *hope im making sense* during the high and after the trip like i did have an epiphany i just never went through with it which .makes me feel i couldve avoided all that bad shit that happened

Sorry if this seems like im venting

I’ll rail 30-40mg and then after 3 glasses of wine it’s over. Ambien has sent me to the ER and i still can’t get over it. (20+ people at a party in my apartment watched me stand up out of bed and then timber like a tree sending my forehead right into the edge of my desk, needed 7 stitches and only remember coming to in the ER in the middle of my sutures) Another time I was 60mg and 4 beers deep when i decided to smoke a massive (from what i’m told) chop/moke/mole/scoffe/popper/whatever you wanna call weed and tobacco in a bowl. Proceeded to throw up all over myself instantly, and then need to be reminded every 5 minutes that it was me who threw up. My homie watched me butt ass naked clean up my own yack off the floor while constantly asking “someone threw up?”, “Who threw up on me?” and “where’d this puke come from?” Apparently my memory was literally that of a goldfish. All i do is embarrass and/or hurt myself but giving up ambien is the last thing i want to do. Idk what to do. Do i need rehab?

11145,I :love: Drugs,Maybe I’m losing myself?,"         Some uppers/Adderall has always been fun to mess with, being super confident, motivated to get shit done, being super social. Xr for a school day, Ir for a party. When it comes to uppers, I’m that person who gets paranoia coming down, and binges for more and more...

I’m only 17,  my father left 2 years ago, around the time my mom was diagnosed with stomach cancer, he was having an affair with one of my mothers trusted friends. When we all needed him the most, he just left the family to leave us to suffer on our own. Just me and my sister to support our mother, also my brother, but he wasn’t around much to see all the damage.  And the grandparents gave my mom lots of support but they’re also getting pretty sick.

 Life was a lot easier back then being a kid for me. Drugs didn’t have to make things better, not having so much responsibility’s, anybody could just think of whatever they wanted of you, because you were a kid... who cared?! Sitting in Elementary school, impatiently waiting for last bell to ring to go home and play the new Halo 3 for hours. 
Now it’s just impatiently waiting to get out of school to see what drugs I can get.

Seems to me the older I get, the more bored I get of everything, I just get more depressed, unmotivated, lazy, and selfish. I’d trade anything to bring back the days of me in underwear, chugging cans of coke and staying up all night, playing video games with friends online, seeing my mom and dad happy together, having great dinners and watching movies. If age 12 me from the past has seen the things I’ve done, he’d cry. 

Only 17, snorted heroin, Dilaudids, coke, meth...
I also get drunk at least, once every weekend. Smoking weed almost every day, Lsd, dmt and Shrooms were fun, until anxiety became a real thing to me, also tried pure MDMA, a very special drug that I respect. And also tried mostly every prescription drug with recreational value there is in the U.S.A. Been smoking 3-20 cigs a day for about a year.

Now, I’m not just saying this to brag about all the drugs I’ve tried, only just to inform you about the shit I’m doing at this age I never, and I mean ever, thought I’d do. Especially meth, considering my sister is an IV addict for ice with 2 children and a bf who tries to care for her. Even DCF comes by once in awhile, probation meetings once a week, random drug tests. She still gets away with it... hate seeing that shit at my own home.

I always keep telling myself, theirs people out there going through worse, as long I have shelter, food, water, and at least somebody who cares about me and that I’m still in school, why should I be so sad? Maybe it’s because I miss the purity that was in me, I’m scared soon I won’t be able to tell what’s wrong and good. I’m scared these substances are changing me. Went from smoking out of a one hitter in the woods of some mids with my best friend in 8th grade sketching out we look high or smell like weed To Taking Adderall 3 days straight in a row, with 15+ hours of sleep throughout the days and here I am on that 3rd day, taking 1.5 of k pin, 20 mg of oxy, and snorting meth on top of all the Adderall. 

I’m still young, I want to change, I don’t want drugs to be the only thing I find interest in and get excited for, I want my sister to get help to, I want to see theirs more in life then getting high.
I’m loosing self control, I’m losing myself. And I’m not even addicted to anything hard, it’s just the craving of wanting to feel something so bad, being sober just feels so numb and aggravating to me.

As I type this as my mouth clinches, heart pounds, palms sweat, hands shake. I’m truly disgusted with who I am becoming.  If it’s one thing I learned. Shit can change real fast without you expecting it.

11160,Cannabis,"I'm addicted to weed, would love some advice","I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to smoking weed and could use some advice, or maybe just some reassurance that I can fix this.

Basically, I've been dealing with some mental illnesses for almost my whole life. I have BPD, severe social anxiety, and severe depression (though it's not as bad as it used to be). My daily routine is the same everyday, and I can't currently drive, so I stay at home with my family all day everyday. The only time I go out is for work, which my dad drives me to and from. Otherwise, I'm at home trying to pursue my interests (painting, drawing, writing, video games) and/or talking to my 2 online friends. It's pretty boring, and I'm currently working on the driving situation. That's my main priority right now.

My history with weed is very long. I started smoking around 6 years ago, and since then it's been on and off. I'll go 6 months straight of smoking weed multiple times everyday, and then 6 months doing it twice a week, and then 2 months with none at all, and then jump back to another 6 months doing it everyday again. So very inconsistent, but usually I'm a heavy user. As of today, I've been smoking multiple times everyday for around 3-4 months, and I smoked the last of it a few hours ago.

Now, I'm writing this at 6 am because I realize the problem has gone too far. The main reason I smoke is out of boredom and to actually feel interested and engaged in life. It makes me happy and music sounds so good I have to sing along, and it inspires me to paint and makes everything I do seem a lot more fun. But when I'm sober, it's all so dull in comparison. I'm guessing that's just because I'm not used to being sober now; being high became the new norm. Because of this, I feel extremely tempted to smoke whenever I'm not at work and have free time I'd like to enjoy. I find it hard to maintain a positive attitude without it, because everything seems so uninteresting and bland. I feel like I'm not nearly as much fun to talk to, because I'm less happy and less enthusiastic. All my positivity seems to rely on being high, or looking forward to being high later.

At times like this when I don't have any weed, I turn to coffee. It's hardly an alternative, but at least being hyper from the caffeine makes me a bit more excitable. I drink coffee everyday too though, because it's actually something I can consume at work (I only work part time but I still drink it everyday anyway). So it's losing its flare for me as well.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I've been smoking everyday for months bc life is boring and uninteresting unless I'm high

&amp;#x200B;

I'd just like to relearn how to enjoy life without the help of drugs. I want to be confident that I can feel great happiness and enthusiasm naturally, but it's difficult to convince myself of that. I'm going to try to cut down or maybe just stop completely, cold turkey. If anyone has advice on how to cope with the cravings, finding enjoyment without it, or anything like that, I would really appreciate hearing it. It will get easier as I readjust to life without it, right? After I've gone a little while without it, sobriety will begin feeling normal again, won't it? Has anyone else felt like this and successfully cut down on smoking? What changed when you finally quit, and are you happy you did it?

So I've been thinking about growing a San Pedro cactus to extract mescaline out of it.

I was wondering tho if it is worth it. I've been reading this guide (https://www.erowid.org/plants/cacti/cacti_guide/cacti_guide4.shtml) a bit and as it seems the cacti need to grow pretty big.

My questions are:

- How much mescaline would I get out of an 6 inch (15 cm) cacti piece?

- How much time would I need, to grow a 18 inch cactus?

- would it be better to grow from seeds or to buy small cacti?

- I live in germany, would it be better to groe indoors or outdoors?

- Maybe an idea on how much money I'd have to spent on the whole process.

11209,Cannabis,Paranoid weed thoughts just saved my life and my family,"The weed I currently smoke contains a ton of THC and nearly no CBD so it comes with the well known downsides of smoking weed full-on. I don't mind it but never thought it would be useful one day!

&amp;#x200B;

So I have tapestry everywhere in my room, including a thin cloth hanging in front of my window. I want to see outside my window most of the time so I just tuck it behind the belt of my roll down shutters.

Today I took a bong hit, lit a candle on my windowsill, sat at my desk and ""checked my situation"" - sort of a short meditation you could say. I immediatly noticed paranoid thoughts, my brain was looking at everything that could go bad. I randomly notice the candle again, highly flammable cloth hanging above and can see my house on fire already. I thought about the chain reaction of the fire, my horrible attempts at trying to stop it, what I would try to save and how I would inform everyone in the house. You know what I mean. 

I follow these thoughts all the time, knowing where they come from. So normally I ignore them or sometimes try to find that one insecurity or whatever it is that lies behind some of them. Today I felt like listening to it and moving the candle (sadly doesn't look nearly as good there) and if you believe it or not, after less than 15 minutes the cloth fell because my shutters slid down a bit. I was a bit shocked at first knowing that the chances of a fire were higher than I am if I hadn't moved that candle.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I will always follow fire safety rules now. 

Edit: I know that I’m a careless person and do stupid shit. I’m used to weed making me do even more stupid shit but this day it teached me a lesson. That lesson isn’t to smoke weed and listen to paranoid sounding thoughts it’s that I can’t be as careless and have to protect the ones I care about. Also, thinking that awful things will never happen to me isn’t the right way to go. It’s been my approach to life, always ignoring what could happen and just enjoying the moment.

11273,Alprazolam,Xanax vs Klonopin,"Hey all!  I have a history of panic disorder and have used Xanax on and off for 15 years.  The most I would use is 0.5mg x 3/day (1.5mg a day), sometimes for 6 months.  Then I'd drop it down to an as needed and do a slow taper to eventually stop.  I've been through several phases like this.  I've never had any issues with benzo withdrawal using xanax.  

In the last few weeks I've had some cracking panic attacks that my usual methods haven't managed to control.  I haven't any xanax for about a year, so I popped into a doctor to get some emergency xanax.  He not only gave me the xanax but also Klonopin and suggested I take 0.5mg every night before bed.

I'm completely confident using xanax as I've never had withdrawal issues with, but I'm worried a out using a new benzo.  Has anyone had experience using both? Is it likely that because I have no issues using xanax that Klonopin use will also be ok?  

I don't actually like taking benzos, well, to be honest, I'm very neutral about them.  Xanax has helped me through some tough times and I've always been more than happy to stop when I'm feeling in a good place again.  I'm just worried Klonopin will challenge me in ways xanax hasn't.

I’m mostly take large-moderate dosages of psychedelic mushrooms every other weekend but last night was one of the most insane phenomenons I’ve ever experienced.
After I was on my fourth bowl, I decided to grab a water from the kitchen and as soon as I walked out of the room I was on complete auto pilot walking around the house for no reason. I was experiencing this kind of lag where it would set me back a couple steps no matter where I walked. I kept getting turned around and lost in rooms. My head and arms twitched around and I kept getting new thoughts every millisecond and was seeing everything in frames. This lag would speed up or slow down depending how hard I focused and it seem like an eternity just walking down a hallway. My mind would constantly throw up images of me in different parts of the house and replay certain actions.

As i followed them all the way up the sky was a bright blue, and the tops of the trees were waving back and forth as if they were saying hello to me. And then the trees became silhouettes and i no longer saw the sky.

I heard a whiserpy voice creeping behind me that just kept repeating ""speak to much"". When it got close the voice went away and everything went silent. My vision was directed to the ground where these mushrooms were growing on the fallin tree i was standing on.

11350,Psychedelics,The Tao of Salvia,"Hello guys and gals! Agoriass here! I just did salvia (extract) and I wish to share my story here for the interested :) 
(I smoked an extract 10x first via pipe and then via bong and took quite a decent amount)

I have always felt deeply interested in Taoism and Chinese mysticism and consider myself a well-read Taoist. I noticed that the Tao is the theme of my spiritual trip. (The Tao is a concept in many Eastern Philosophies translated into ""the way"". When i explain the concept to people i tell them that the reality is the upper part of a tree and the Tao is the roots. It forms and nurtures the world and is involved in everything just as matter and physical stuff would be, just not noticable as matter).

After the bongshot things became really confusing and weird (as they do) but not unpleasant. I kept feeling like I was a cartoon or something until fell down closed my eyes and focused my mind. I decided I had to do something with my trip instead of just enjoying some stupid cartoons hahaha. So i tried visualising the Tao, something known for being impossible to visualise and.. it failed logically ofcourse. But i did get visions of a completely dark space with 3 doors and 1 broken one. The doors were shaped like bread and big although i don't know how big I was in contrast. I decided to visit them all and I got 3 different visions. The first was of a mexican man enjoying fixing his old 60s car and he was named Valdez. The other was Bolo, a (supposedly African) warrior that was fleeing from a erupting volcano on the mountain. Both were short but clear. The third one I didn't see, but felt. It felt as if my being, my essence was guided through the cosmos. Alongside me was Valdez and Bolo and many other creatures (horses insects whatever) on a kinda wire thingie. I felt like I was a bead on a chain. My essence (soul whatever name you have for it) felt resonating with the other beings. 

Later in the shower I realized that my essence, my piece of the ""Tao"" was the same as in my cosmic brothers and sisters. They were resonating because they were simply the same part of the bigger Tao, like a chain made of the same type of steel. 

I feel as the reason for life is maybe not to be found in this life, but in the bigger picture. So don't stress yourself for finding a reason to live, it will reveal itself to you automatically. And although Bolo and Valdez had their own personalities and everything, we shared the same essence. We were the same cosmic entity, and this counts for all the beads on the chain!

I told Michael that DEFINITELY was not weed, and that a high off a dab pen only lasts an hour or two.

Does anyone know what could've caused a reaction like this?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aelhgd/my_friend_vaped_what_he_thought_was_marijuana/

My logic was that I was going to cheat on the exam so I didn’t need to study and could trip out. I dropped one tab at 2a and didn’t get the desired effects I was looking for so at 4-5a I dropped a .1 of molly. The tab didn’t give me strong enough visuals for an actual candyflip but there was a point where the two substances collided and it was orgasmic to say the least. I was still wide awake at 8a just walking around my room and my dorm completely tweaking out and sleep deprived. Ended up writing the exam later on in the day and failed the exam (obviously) still passed the course tho.,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aemazb/the_time_i_candyflipped_for_my_first_time_the_day/

Don’t mind me asking, but what’s the point of smoking if you’re doing it so much you can’t feel it, and it just becomes a natural state of being? Why not take a tolerance break and learn to practice moderation, so that you can actually enjoy the feeling of being high when you have some down time?

I’m sorry if this doesn’t apply to all chronic users of bud, but it just struck me as something interesting and I’d like to get some feedback.

I see people talk about how weed ""isn't habit forming or addicting"", even though every other drug is considered to be. In particular, the shit that pisses me off is the ""weed makes me a better driver"" stuff. Maybe you think you perform better while driving, but I imagine you think you're concentrating more when you just have a slowed reaction time. 

Another one regards weed use during pregnancy. I see women talking about how their children turned out fine when they smoked weed. Some even claim their children are advanced learners *because* they smoked. That is ridiculous. Seriously, can be please stop this shit? 

I am all for medical and recreational legalization of weed, but does anyone stop to consider what these wild claims mean? Like, imagine making the same claims you make about weed with alcohol. People would think you were insane. 

I am a firm believer that regular and semi-regular drug users are a minority in the US population. Thus, to legalize weed we need the support and votes of those who don't smoke. It's hard to win their support when we make idiotic claims like how a mild altering substance ""improves"" driving or how kids are born smarter *because* of it rather than in spite of it.

I have a juul, which I have been using very cautiously over the past months to not get addicted. I use it a couple times a week mainly for the stimulant, but the head rush is nice too. 


I have taken these steps to prevent addiction:

-I only use it when the stimulant will help me with something

-If I feel a craving for it, I dont use it for a couple days

-If it's taking me longer to get a headrush, I don't use it for a couple days


I 100% believe I am not addicted to nicotine. But, my parents found my juul, a long with the pods, and took it away. Like $150 worth. After this, I remembered that I still have an old 17% nic vape that I stopped using after getting the juul.


I would like to continue getting the nic stimulant, at least until I finish off the pods, to get my money's worth since I already lost a decent amount.


Is it worth the risk?

11473,Psychedelics,My blew-me-out of the water 60ug LSD trip,"Hello everyone! I've just had my first 60ug LSD dose yesterday, in the past I've done a few Ayahuasca ceremonies and 4-aco-dmt trips on low/high doses, I'm here to share how my day went!

I have just bought a few LSD tabs, and I thought about taking it yesterday as I had the flat to myself, I started my day at 9am right after everyone left for work, I got my milligram scale box (which contains most of my precious chemicals), and I tested a small piece of the paper to make sure what I had was in fact LSD, seeing a positive test I went on to take half a tab of 120ug.

I left the piece of paper below my tongue for a good 45 minutes, reading a few reviews beforehand I thought I would feel the effect soon after 30 minutes have passed, which led me to think whether this is a true 120ug tabs, so I smoked a joint and waited it out. Exactly 30 minutes later I noticed my surrounding looking a little bit gooey as if I was looking underwater, expanding and shrinking, I tried to work a bit for the next hour of the come up but I could hardly focus so I switched to some music, some of my favourite Dire Straits songs were playing which I listened to since I was 4, and that was the first time I ever “felt” the music, and heard new notes that I never heard before but if they were to be missing the song would not sound the same. I was amazed as to how an invisible amount of chemicals could have such effect on the consciousness, and you realize that we’re living life without enjoying the little bits that sometimes truly matter.

For the next few hours I was just watching comedy stuff and I laughed my ass off, I haven’t laughed until I had a headache multiple time in the range of 10 minutes to the point I had to stop watching because I couldn’t laugh without feeling pain my stomach.

Next I sat down thinking about the recent death of close family member, I had so many feelings and emotions built up that tears came flowing uncontrollably, I thought about how one’s life could end at the most unexpected of times. I suddenly remembered my first time with Ayahuasca where I had a breakthrough experience, and decided to go meditate for a few moments.

Even though I had no CEV I could somehow “see” and “feel” it, my mind started wondering and thoughts flew by without me entertaining them, until I started thinking about consciousness again and I knew this would lead to something interesting.

I started to visualize the human body, this consciousness vessel made of finite material, is only but layers of skin and fat and muscles, which when all stripped out you’re left with the motherboard, the human brain, this tiny bit of chemicals and proteins give life to this intelligent creature. And then I went on to strip away the visible matter, which left me with nothing at all, except this.. Intelligence.

Then I started visualizing how if you clone a person you would  end up with two identical intelligent beings, but the question is: would they make the same decisions?

Personality has little to do with genetics, which makes me think that during the course of a few days they will most definitely both start making different decisions. Which means that I am not just my brain and my body, but also an intelligent energy.

During this trip, I could somehow listen to the flow of how thoughts originate, I could visualize a thought as a sparkle and then I’m using my brain to cross check it with my past to make the right decision, this, in a way, can be described as if I felt that my brain is the computer, and my consciousness is the user behind the keyboard. The impact of this realization was nothing compared to the next one that I suddenly had which was, I actually *am* this consciousness! As soon as I finished the thought in my mind this rush of euphoria came rushing down and there were no words to describe how thankful I was for just *being*!

Next, with the thought still in mind, I began to actually see that this body is just temporary, and so, one must do their best to keep it safe and healthy, before they can go on to the next step of consciousness.

The next few hours were spent listening to some Tool songs in the darkness, this was by far one of the most insightful low dose trips ever.

Much love to you all!

11477,LSD,Confused and need help from experienced acid users- Will this drug help me find answers?,"Hey how’s it going, I’m writing this post cause I tripped on LSD the other day for the second time, but I have used mushrooms a few times previously. However my main concern is that I’ve used LSD twice before, because a buddy said and I’ve read about LSD being able to offer guidance I have begun college this year and I am unclear about what I want to do with my life and I was hoping these both times I used LSD it would clear my head and hopefully bring me to a decision. I’m not using this drug as a fun just wanting to see visuals type of thing if you know what I mean, I’m trying to find answers. However the both times I’ve used it I feel as if I get even more confused while on it, and even prior to the experience I am a little confused. For example while I’m tripping I am completely confused about everything happening in my life, and this last time I started to get very paranoid, but my first trip I didn’t get paranoid at all. I am currently on winter break and will have to pick a degree by the end of the semester. Should I try using this drug another time, like do y’all think this is the right way to go about this decision? Also should I take certain precautions before I actually trip? Both times I’ve meditated before and I try to put myself in the right place so I could possibly find some answers, but is there more I should do? Or should I go about making this decision another way since this is my future? I know all of this might sound stupid, but I wanted to ask people who are more experienced with this drug have they ever made a life decision because of there trip? So my main questions are: Am I going about this decision the right way? How should I put myself in the state of mind to find these answers? Will this even work? Should I have a tripsitter who is a buddy of mine and is practically family who has experienced this drug several times, or should I go at it solo (both times I went solo, but I’ve talked to people over the phone and on ps4)? Should I do activities while I’m on it like I have previously, or are these distractions from my main focus?

It would be awesome if y’all could clear some of these questions up for me. If this is not the right way to go about it let me know. I’ll appreciate any answers.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aen7ye/confused_and_need_help_from_experienced_acid/

An hour into the trip I start feeling a little weird like anxious. Then my friends were watching The interview in the living room so I went from being outside needing sometime to myself because I was starting to feel sick to watching the movie for a little while with my friends and feeling a little better. Then, I went to the bathroom for a little while and was really feeling scared and feeling like it was hard to hang on like I didn’t like how I was feeling. I was sort of seeing stuff move but nothing crazy. Then I remember going from scared and feeling anxious and wanting to vomit to feeling a lot of love and happiness and joy and I couldn’t stop smiling, but then I got emotional because I was so happy and went to the bathroom and started crying more and saying how it’s ok to cry you need it, you haven’t been ok and that’s ok to not be ok just let things be.

I took half of one because I've never done it (and I usually hate downers) and when I didn't feel anything I asked my friend if she thought I should take the other half. 

I shouldn't have listened to her when she said yes. I'm fucking tiny. The half just hadn't kicked in yet. I took the other half and for the first couple hours it was great. We were in the movie theater watching bohemian rhapsody and it was a fun movie especially while high. Oh man I loved the oxy at first. Then a few mintues before the movie ends, I'm puking. And between the time we left the theater and the time we got home I had puked separately around three times.

Spent the rest of the night puking and feeling like my stomach was gonna fall out. 0/10 would not recommend. I mean I'd do it again but only take half and pace myself with the other half.

In other news, my friend actually went out to do something with me and not as much of a humungous bitch as I thought. Still a raging fucking unnecessarily narcissistic bitch who has no reason to think shes the shit since shes just an unemployed multi drug abuser but my resentment towards her has nothing to do with this sub so I digress.
 
- end of ze update - 

I've heard if you've got anything weighing on your mind or your in a bad place, your trip is gonna be bad. I've been visiting a friend away from home for the past few days and am miserable. All she wants to do really is smoke dope.

 And I'll indulge in it but I've never done it four, five days in a row before this. The comedown between using makes me feel like absolute shit, I've been depressed and crying and it's likely not helped by the fact that I'm just not liking my experience here. I want to try lsd for the first time but I'm worried it'll just make things worse and not better.

I feel so ashamed. I hate smoking meth every day, it just makes me feel so dirty. It's good while it last obviously and then I'm just irritable, hating life. And the obvious response to that would be to just keeping doing more but after a terrible trip months ago where I felt like I was on the verge of overdose or heart attack, I've been trying to pace myself. 

While I'm here I've been making an effort to not forget to shower, brush my teeth, try to sleep even if my body says hell fucking otherwise. Force food down at least once a day.

But my friend, she fucking stinks. She doesnt eat much and shes definitely changed from when I last saw her. More unhinged than usual. Definitely has to be high 90 percent of the time. I'm worried about her but also frustrated.

I want to go home and at one point last night I had the thought that if I dont, I could very well die here. Which is stupid cause there's people out there and in this forum who have done way more drugs than I have and are perfectly fine. It's just the guilt I guess, mommy and daddy's little girl getting high, hanging around addicts and drug dealers that shoot up heroin on the same couch I sleep on.

I also started working full time, to more than full time, to barely sleeping... somewhere in the 3 years I’ve been taking stimulants, I went from using them to function to abusing them to be superhuman. I was put on vyvanse for awhile, and it really messed me up. By the end of my time on it, I would skip a day or two so I could take 2 or 3x the dose in a day. It wasnt healthy, and I knew that, and my lack of sleep and weight loss made it concrete. So I switched back to addy and have been doing a lot better.
       In Oct of last year I had a preg scare and didnt take addy for a couple of weeks. It felt awesome but as soon as I had my body back, I went right back to taking addy daily. I’m only taking 20mg/day, but it stopped helping me. I went from taking adderal to be motivated and get my work done, to taking adderal to feel good, and I stiiiiill wouldnt get my work done.

Additionally, I believe they are quieter than crackers. Any good reason to get a cracker instead of a dispenser, though?

2. If I get a dispenser, do I need anything else? Will I be good with just a dispenser, the n2o chargers, and balloons?

3. Is there any storage information I should know about? Keeping with the under-the-radar spirit, I will be hiding the chargers deep in my closet in a box under laundry. Will this be alright?

11611,Cannabis,I took a weed vape on my cruise,December 2018 cruise to Freeport Bahamas and Princess Cay. I had a direct flight into MCO airport. My first time doing this. I was nervous but I did a lot of research on Reddit! I had zero problems. I packed the battery of my vape in my carry on and the cartridge in a lipstick tube in my checked bag. Getting it on the ship was a breeze. I read that you shouldn’t take anything off the ship with you so I left my vape in the cabin while we were at ports. The locals offered me some recreational which was nice! I left what was left in the cartridge in a public bathroom trash can. But after going through customs debarkation I wish I would have kept it. We legit just stood in line and someone asked for our passports and looked at them. They asked if we bought anything at port. I said yes I bought a snow globe which was true.

11732,Psychedelics,Weed is now psychedelic after taking a bitter nbome compound.,"I took some bitter tabs on New Years I thought was lsd but when I put the tab in my mouth I knew something was up, it tasted very bitter and chemical like, I didn’t spit it out because I was telling myself the bitter taste was just the ink but I knew something was up. Despite knowing it wasn’t lsd my dumbass kept it in my mouth. (Huge mistake) The tabs had little to no effect on me what so ever, then again I was rolling as well that night so I can’t exactly say they didn’t effect me at all because of the roll it made it very hard to tell. At the very least I got very slight psychedelic hallucinations. Anyway I was very upset thinking I could just write off the experience as a lame nbome chemical that didn’t effect me and more importantly didn’t kill me. But of course I was wrong now it’s been over a week later and whenever I smoke weed I feel like I’m fully on tripping on acid but the visuals are different it doesn’t feel like acid but very similar. It sucks because I don’t wanna be fully blown tripping with hppd when I smoke weed. I just wanna chill and relax instead now I get tons of anxiety when I smoke, like a mini 3 hour trip. My theory is that the nbome compound triggered something in my brain to make me trip every time I smoke now... it really sucks I just wanna smoke and enjoy it now I can barely smoke a joint of MIDS and I get blasted into an acid like trip for 3 whole hours..... test your drugs kids hppd is not fun, especially if it’s triggered every time you smoke weed....",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aepzew/weed_is_now_psychedelic_after_taking_a_bitter/
11846,Long Post,"Trauma, addiction and healing","Tl’dr: was bashed 19 years ago, used drugs to numb the emotional pain not knowing how much it has affected me. Have identified my issues and that I need to address my baggage but unsure how to get this thing off my back.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: When I was 16 I was at a party with some friends, we were all drinking and I had drank about 6-8 beers or so and was happily intoxicated. Midway through the party some guys arrived, I recognized one of them (we’ll call him JJ) as one of the kids a year or two below me at school, JJ had a reputation not to be fucked with, whether it was his older brothers activities or other I am not sure but I always tried to stay away from these types of guys.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after they arrived (found out later they we not invited and ‘gatecrashed’ the party) one of them ( I don’t remember who) started pushing around a kid, I sort of knew him as being a bit of a weakling and he clearly wasn’t interested in a fight and looked distressed. They proceeded to mock him, push and punch him, take his things and generally traumatize the poor guy – so I spoke up.

&amp;#x200B;

I was sitting on some brickwork, about 3 courses high had a girl I was tuning next to me (I’d liked her for a while and things were going well in that regard).

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at the guy who was picking on this kid and without thinking blurted out “hey just leave him alone man” to which I heard a reply to my left. Little did I know that one of the gatecrashers (we’ll call him SS) was standing right next to me, he said “what cunt?” and as quick as anything punched me from my rear left side, I never saw it coming and was sitting down at the time so had no chance.

&amp;#x200B;

The initial punch rocked me, I leaned over to get my balance to stand up, put my hands on the ground for balance and was hit with another right. This knocked me to the ground and then I got kicked in the face, back, ribs before I was knocked out, I am not sure which blow caused me to lose consciousness or who was delivering the blows, I remember it coming from seemingly everywhere so assume more than one person was on me.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time after I came to, blurred and disorientated I was helped to my feet by a friend. I asked him what happened and he said just go home man, you need to get out of here now. I grabbed a half full bottle of Jacks on my way out and remember drinking the rest straight as I stumbled home feeling my indented cheekbone, crying, confused and thinking about what this meant for me. I remember having a feeling of “why didn’t any of my friends fight for me?”.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home and went straight to my room and lay down, my mum came in, it was very unusual of me to go straight to my room, I always made time to sit and talk with my mother at night especially after a party or event. She came in and the first thing I said, in a broken sobbing voice, was “don’t turn on the light” She immediately turned the light on and asked me what was up. I showed her my injuries and explained what had happened and it was off to the emergency department.

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday night in emergency is not fun, especially when you have just been bashed and are coming down off too much booze. I vomited over and over, saw a Dr, was too drunk to operate on and waited for my turn under the knife. Surgery was performed without issue and I ended up with a plate, two metal wires and some screws through the eye floor and upper brow, specifically the zygomatico-orbital foramina to keep my face from dropping and bring the structure back into line.

&amp;#x200B;

After surgery I woke up feeling groggy, coming down from it all was not an enjoyable experience. I was hooked to IV pethidine on demand via a button that would release a dose when pressed which I thoroughly enjoyed and used frequently throughout recovery in the hospital – this is where I got a realisation for how good drugs are.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn’t eat proper food for two weeks and pretty much stayed in my mother’s bed on Panadeine forte (codeine) eating through a straw for this time. None of my friends came to see me whilst I was in recovery. The bruising was horrendous.

&amp;#x200B;

I had extensive nerve damage to the left of my face and experienced sharp, shooting pain/discomfort when brushing my teeth on the upper left quadrant for about 5 years following.

&amp;#x200B;

The plates, screws and wires can still be felt on my face today, I used them as a show off for some time to deal with things, I think. Grossing people out by getting them to feel the screws.

&amp;#x200B;

Current day: All that happened 19 years ago and I never really took much time to have a real introspective look into how that affected me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 35yo, happily married, run my own business and have two beautiful children of 6 &amp; 9yo. Regardless of my picture perfect family situation I have always felt unfulfilled and a want for something more, I found relief in drugs, weed was always a friend of mine, as I grew older I started to use opioids by cold water extracting OTC codeine forte tablets and used to mix with small amounts of alcohol to get fucked up. I used alcohol daily for years, sometimes going on binges. I dabbled in meth but told myself I didn't like it as I think I could have easily overindulged.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometime in 2016 I started to go through a mental change, a maturity if you will. I started looking into philosophy, spiritual states and self-discovery, my father, as I knew him, had always been spiritually connected and I looked up to him for achieving such a mind state (he left my mother when I was young and moved to India for his spiritual journey). I researched psychedelics for about 18 months, looking into the changed mindset of people who use them for healing. At this stage I had no idea I was carrying any baggage and put it down to me maturing mentally.

&amp;#x200B;

I ordered some LSD from a vendor and started growing mushrooms. I grow my own weed also.

&amp;#x200B;

My first trip: I started with 75µg and this was giggly and enjoyable. I upped it to 150µg another time and had a great time until I smoked some weed and fell into a negative panicky headspace. I decided I wanted to go further, I discussed my intention with my wife who accommodated my request and stayed somewhere else for 24 hours. I dropped 300µg at home and had a pretty intense 12 hour ride, I intended to be introspective and utilized eye shades and a playlist which I put together from my research into tripping as well as the company of my dog and spending time in my garden which I work so hard to maintain.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all the trip went well, I got a lot from it and saw behavioral changes in the sense of seeing things from other peoples perspectives and be a lot more understanding, confident and motivated.

&amp;#x200B;

Not totally satisfied with where I was at I ordered some MDMA, (still unaware of my past weighing me down at this time). I dropped 100mg solo one night and had a great roll. I sat outside and had such a overwhelming feeling of contentment – great.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven’t tried the mushrooms but managed to grow about an oz which will be more than enough for my lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been dosing LSD for about 6 months, using 20µg as a pick me up and motivational tool about bi-monthly, this has been incredibly positive. I still battle with alcohol addiction, though this year have had more days sober than not which is a huge shift.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I dosed 20µg and it had been about 4 weeks since my last dose, I smoked some weed at night about 10 hours after dosing, I had the intention to induce a light trip as weed has given me that headspace after LSD. I lay down alone in my sons’ bed and put in the headphones playing my trip playlist and trying to extract some nostalgia from the tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

I let whatever come in be present and let my mind go where it wanted, I have never had a good memory (put it down to my excessive cannabis use as a teen) but to my surprise I started to remember the violent event that changed the course of my life back in 1999. I replayed the event in my mind, from the moment SS walked into the party, locked onto me, stood next to me, to being hit, kicked and ‘recovering’. I had the feeling that SS intended to hit me as soon as he walked into the party. I realised that I have not dealt with this trauma, I had an overwhelming feeling of being weighed down by what happened. I realised that the assault changed a few things for me.

&amp;#x200B;

1. My social status was cut down, from a confident, happy, witty 16 year old with lots of friends I became defensive, subdued, paranoid and weak minded.
2. I didn’t get to finish tuning that girl and after the event she was no longer interested.
3. The offender went on to build a reputation from bashing me, this is probably the part that hurts the most.

&amp;#x200B;

Well it’s the next day, I spoke with my incredibly supportive wife first thing this morning and she was quick to dismiss PTSD. She has an attitude of not diagnosing anything for whatever reason, I guess she doesn’t want a condition to be a fixation of my suffering – I’m still not completely sure here.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I have recognized the elephant in the room so to speak and am now ready to deal with it. I just don’t know how. I really don’t want to see a therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I have agreed to roll together and have a chat about things, I think this will be a good first step in getting it all out, from there I don’t know what I am going to do, probably trip again on LSD and probably try those mushrooms when they call my name also and continue to reduce my drinking and change my relationship with alcohol.

&amp;#x200B;

I have another part of me that wants revenge for what SS took from me that night. I keep a folder with social media info, photos, locations, SS's family ties, SS’s business name and number, vehicles etc. I think sometimes about going and spray-painting his work van with obscenities or other acts of vandalism, I sometimes even think about donning a balaclava and baton and smashing the cunt’s head in – I have too much to lose to take this path though and reason takes over.

&amp;#x200B;

11847,Psychedelics,Best friend is struggling with the after effects of frequent LSD use. Looking for insight and advice on how to better support her.,"Just for reference I have been around psychedelics a lot and have used shrooms a handful of times for spiritual purposes which was super beneficial for me. I have not used acid before, which is why I am asking you guys to just enlighten me with some information or personal experiences with it so I can better understand what my friend is experiencing and possibly provide better support for her. 

My best friend has been using acid very frequently. Last week she dropped acid 6 consecutive days which would make it around 25 times since late November of 2018. At first she was doing it for spiritual purposes but now as she describes it, has turned into “a way to feel happy.” She has always been a genuinely positive and bright person but I’ve slowly noticed big changes within her that are making me worried. She confronted me about how she’s feeling the other day and told me that (while sober) she does not care about absolutely anything anymore. And that acid has changed her views so much that she feels “odd and out of place” without it and that she has no true emotions towards anything. Basically a feeling of indifference towards everything is her life whether negative or positive. That acid is the only thing in her life that is keeping her happy after using it as frequently as she did. She told me she wants to “go back to how she was before.” She told me she was in an amazing place before upping her intake of it and now she feels like she has ruined herself. Me and a couple of our other close friends (who’ve dropped before) had a heart to heart with her and we expressed we are here to support her with what she is going through. We told her to take a break from it and offered to go out and distract her from when she is craving it. However, she stated she simply does not care about our worries and advice, and that she will probably still take it whenever and however much she wants to. At that point I kind of gave up because I do not want to control her if that is her way of thinking. I completely understand it is her decision to stop taking so I’m not sure what other things I could do to help. 

She has an addictive personality as she has abused Xanax “just for fun”before which made me incredibly hurt to see her go through that (ended up with rehab). I understand that acid itself is not addictive but I am worried that she will go through it again.

I have several close people to me that have dealt with the horrors of addictions to things like heroin and opiates so this kind of thing really effects me. I am scared of losing my best friend to a drug. I have never seen her like this before and my heart deeply hurts that she is not herself.

If anyone could provide some personal experiences or advice for myself (whether it be to take a step away from her as i am realizing this situation could become toxic for both of us or other ways to get through to her) 

TL;DR: Best friend has been deeply affected after frequent use of LSD and after having a heart to heart with her, nothing seems to have clicked. Looking for some advice on how to handle this. ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aer02u/best_friend_is_struggling_with_the_after_effects/

11915,Methamphetamine,I started using crystal meth recreationally in the beginning of December... Over the past month and a half I have been escalating the amount of times per week I'd use... Last night I had a wake up call after spending night two awake crawling on the floor with a flashlight... Any advice on quitting?,"So I thought I could control my usage, basically because in the past two years I occasionally would experiment with crystal - I'd do it once in a while over maybe a 3 week period and just quit and not go back for like a year or more. I did that twice since 2016...

&amp;#x200B;

Well, now I feel the situation will be more complicated - my neighbour is a crystal meth addict and for the most part has some on him whenever I go to his garage and ask if I could get a point or two... I also have a friend that does crystal once in a while but when I told him about last night he supported my decision to quit and agreed not to bring me any meth any more...

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah, I went from doing a point so like two decent lines over the night and feeling lit and on top of the fucking world for the next day or two and then not doing any for a week or longer before buying more, to what I realize has been maybe 5 out of the 10 days of this month me high on crystal... I even started smoking it - chasing the dragon using tin foil and a bic pen tube for an inhaler...

&amp;#x200B;

Last night though, after being up for a day and a half by the beginning of the night off of crystal meth mainly but alsp from some coke my buddy brought over the night before (he doesn't fuck with crystal thankfully, only powder not even crack) I ended up out of meth and didn't want to bother my neighbour so I spend literally half the night searching for shards of crystal with the lights off and my phone on using it as a flashlight... I would then smoke the few rare pieces I'd find, along with a lot of random shit that looked like it might be meth... that was fucking bad, man, I felt like a fucking crack head and that's not somebody I plan on becoming or ever want to get close to being... Like, I know I need to quit this addiction asap. I just didn't think I had gotten addicted yet, but now after realizing that I turned into that person yesterday, I feel I gotta fucking end this while it's still in it's infancy, while I can still make it out y'know? It's only been a month and a half of escalating usage, I know if I quit while it's in the beginning stages of addiction I will have a much higher success rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you recommend for me to succeed in my recovery? I won't go to rehab, I'm not on that level of addiction yet and I don't have the money for that either haha, so what can I do? Can you help me with whatever advice you may have to offer me given the situation I am in?

11943,LSD,why does acid affect you like,"i had a horrible acid trip a few months ago and keep thinking about it. i remember about a third of the way through i was lying down with my blanket and i thought to myself “this is either gonna be a really good trip or really horrible” and good was hot and horrible was cold and i felt like my body temperature was increasing or decreasing. 

i also clenched and grinded my teeth so hard my jaw was bruised on one side for a few days and i still have jaw issues to this day. i also realized a bunch of stuff about myself that i wrote down like “i’m social but cant connect to people because of extreme shallowness” and shit like that. i also had the most repetitive thoughts like once i saw my jaw was bruised i couldn’t stop freakin out i thought my face was gonna be like that for hours and made my mom drive me to the emergency room.

He is worried that either the pen has something other then CBD/MTC in it, or that his previous use of psyches gave him some sort of HPPD.

12023,Cannabinoids,A website I found for buying 'CBD' online,"Going to state off quickly because a lot of kids on twitter keep saying to me 'cbd doesn't show up on drug tests', 'cbd isn't illegal' and the point isn't that I don't want CBD to show up.

Now we can continue;

&amp;#x200B;

There's this website (which will not be sourced obviously) which sells CBD online. The problem is that the CEO of the company himself put out a statement in response to a question asking 'Will this CBD show up if tested for?' and he says 'No, not ours.' then continues to say 'Others will'. 

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't make sense to me, but his supporters seem to love him. I don't understand why a CBD product wouldn't show as CBD on a test specifically for it (unless he's using little to no CBD)

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone explain if I'm right, or if there's just a magical way to disguise CBD because I'm genuinely confused.

(Includes trip report),"So about a year ago I did a very irresponsible thing, after having binged a large amount of mdma for about 6 hours, I'd been awake for around 30 hours and coming down. I was not handling the fact that the MDMAs' effects were running out well and was desperate for another high. So I remembered I had some acid, and took all the tabs thinking fuck it why not. Now I'd tripped a lot before but this was about 800ug, when the highest I'd ever gone was \~400, and that was when I was aware of what I was actually about to undergo.  

So it started out pretty normally, I played some CS:GO with my mate while coming up but halfway through the game things got too confusing and I went to another room to grab a drink. I sat down and realised just how quickly the visuals were coming up, and how much more intense they were. Before I knew it things were distorting to ridiculous amounts, colours overflowing everywhere. However I'd started to forget everything, about myself and the world, I started questioning if everything was real, where were all the other people? I was convinced I'd died and was now stuck in time, as some form of preservation. As the trip went further I felt more and more ""primal"", I forgot everything, I vaguely remembered that if I had to pee I'd use the toilet and not just relieve myself, but that's the most humane thing I could remember. I forgot how to do basic math, all I could see was the clock on my phone and remember 2 comes after 1 3 comes after 2 etc, but past 9 I didn't understand numbers anymore. I kept seeing these really basic cartoon-y characters in my head, like those shitty images made in Flash that people put on their sites in early internet days. I felt incredibly primal, like a kid in elementary school or something. I thought I heard people screaming outside for me, but it was just children running around. At one point I even ran out (to the backyard not connected to anything thank god) and yelled ""What do you want?"" and I went back inside. At one point I managed to open Discord on my phone but the visuals were too much, it was impossible to read anything and I thought it was trying to send me messages about me needing help and how I'm stuck in time.  

This went on for a while, I kept pacing around, laid down for a bit, eventually found a lighter and just huddled up as a ball in my bed, occasionally flicking on the lighter for heat, I found out I'd melted a bit of the cord of my light switch thingy. I forgot to mention, but since I was also convinced I was already dead I was just lighting cigarettes inside my house no fucks given. Eventually I started coming to my senses, I remember walking downstairs to my laptop, where I actually had some music cover open of some anime song that had a really colourful video, I put on my headphones and sat down and to this date it was still some of the best visual/auditory experiences I have ever had. The video started and all the colours just flew out of the screen and took over my entire room, it was so fantastic I kept listening to it and I finally started to come down but the visuals were still on another level than I'd ever seen before. Then I talked to the friend I played CSGO with, he asked me what the fuck happened, I asked him when we played and he said it's been 8 hours, I thought it had been like an hour at most.  

Anyway after this it went relatively ok, I started slowly coming down and after a long, long time I finally fell asleep. I fell awful and wasn't convinced I would wake up the next morning but I was fine, other than dehydration and having not eaten for ages. Now this was a year ago, I've done a lot less drugs since for various reasons, and had never tried LSD again because I felt so traumatised from this trip, I felt so bad about it. But I missed the visuals so so much, and the 50+ great trips I've had on it I got so nostalgic. I took one tab about a month ago but I just instantly went back to those very basic visuals , ""primal"" thoughts and felt really dirty and bad about the trip. Only on the comedown when the headspace was weakening and it was just visuals I felt good again. So did I just forever ruin LSD for myself? Will I never experience it like I used to again? I miss the visuals and all the fun I had on it so fucking much, just thinking about it makes me so sad. I've considered trying 2C-B or Shrooms or something but I figure it will produce similar issues.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aet4ts/is_lsd_forever_ruined_for_me_includes_trip_report/

To me it's as though creativity comes naturally, I feel more awake [literately] than I ever have. Don't need sleep for days. Feel on top of the world. Coming up with all sorts of ideas sort of like that South park episode where they drink cough medicine to come up with ideas.

I have even had psychic experiences where I can go into the future for conversations with certain people. Alot of times without me present. I have had a few people verify this. I have also had experiences where I can hear stuff from the past in conversations. Such as people talking shit and discussing what I'm hearing with someone in the room and they said i was able to repeat the conversation verbatim.

12098,Cannabis,Masturbation on Adderall and pot.,"I started taking Adderall a month ago. It immediately made my penis shrivel up. But then after a while I noticed my cock and balls felt amazing- all the time. I started masturbating for a minimum of 8 hours 24 hours the longest. The Adderall makes me rock hard now and these feelings never go away in my groin. Constant pleasure. Adding pot and poppers (amyl nitrate, a vasodilator) makes the experience even more better. I don’t see this as a problem because I don’t neglect daily tasks or work. I’m constantly thinking about sex with my husband or porn/masturbating. It also has increased my volume of cum too. Has that happened to anyone? I do want to know why taking the Adderall alone makes my manhood feel like it’s constantly on the verge of orgasm. Constant pleasure even with slight movement. I can’t stop thinking about sex and masturbation. Why is the Adderall doing this to me? Any thoughts? ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aette9/masturbation_on_adderall_and_pot/
12101,Cannabis,Bisoprolol &amp; Candesartan + Weed - can I safely smoke a joint sometimes?,"Hello, I hope someone can help me out here or could give me some information. I’m 30yo and taking Bisoprolol (2,5mg in the morning) and Candesartan (8mg in the morning) since one month now. The reason is that I had a high blood pressure and tachycardia (racing heart) 24/7. I probably got this from stress (work and relationship) and already feeling much better now since the medicine is working for me. Also I’m taking a therapy which really helps me.

In general I like to smoke/vape weed (without tobacco) 2-3x a month but I haven’t done it since summer 2018 now. I would really like to do it again but before I would like to be sure “what could happen since I’m taking beta blockers etc.”?

In my country/language it’s hard to find any good information about it that’s why I’m here. I really hope someone can help me out and give me some information (what I should know / what could happen / if it’s okay to do it / I I shouldn’t smoke weed at all again etc etc).

I know that the beta blockers keep my racing heart down and the Candesartan will keep my blood pressure down. If I got it right, smoking weed with a high level of THC could increase my racing heart again. Also most types of weed bring the blood pressure down, right? I already found a few basic blogs or posts in general which say ""just do it its awesome"" and others are saying ""you should'nt do it if you have something on your heart"". It would be great do get a better answer, so maybe someone can help me. Right now I could get Blue Dream and Power Kush if I can smoke. O:-)

I bought 100x pressed 2mg Xanax bars more than a month ago. I started first day with 2mg which really didn’t a lot so I took one more. The first week I started with 4mg every night which I felt something but not that strong. Than I started with 6mg for a few weeks which I felt strong but never that I can’t remember what I did the night before. Than I took one week 8mg and than I started with 6mg and now I have only 8 left. 

How should I handle this ? Should I stop cold turkey or try to lower my dose ? How dangerous is it when I suddenly stop. I think the bars are not really 2mg because I think I would have felt way more and really black out which I didn’t. And I can’t get any Xanax anymore.

12152,I :love: Drugs,"Smoked weed at 12 acid at 13 and candyflipped at 14, please give this a read","The first time I smoked bud I was 12.

first time doing acid 13. me and my mate dropped 300ug each for him it was just endless thought loops and I just sat there in his room tripping sack all night long like what the fuck is going on. I even talked to his dad but I didnt think he was real and he was telling me to go to bed or some shit and I just stared him in the eyes and walked away.

 20 minutes later me and my friend wanna go chainsmoke darts and smoke bud. Keep in mind we didnt even have a fucking lighter or rolling papers just a deck and some weed and we thought his parents would be asleep so we just walked out the front door. 2 seconds later his dad comes out screaming what the fuck are you doing and somehow he didnt suspect shit.WHAT THE FUCK his dads a coke user and smokes bud daily how the fuck did he not know what was up.

Inbetween this and the next fucked up sesh I got expelled from high school for selling bud, there was so much fucked shit inbetween (such as taking oxycontin at school lmao)  but for the sake of keeping this post short I'm gonna leave alot of it out.

 1 year later from the previous night (were 14)  me and the same cunt decide to go buy 2 ounces of the best aussie bud there is 2 caps of md and 4 250ug tabs. We took 1 tab each at round 9 and it hit me in 20 minutes flat it was fucking great until he brought out the caps and puts one on his tounge and swallowed it and then hands me mine. 

 We then went on his trampoline and shit was going smoothly until we whipped out the bong and started smoking. I had 0 tolerance and this is still to this day the strongest weed I've come across. We used his dads bong to smoke who knows how many cones and then went back onto the trampoline and my mate just fucking lost it. I was too busy communicating with what felt like god and feeling every molecule of my body be torn apart and then explode into some sort of blissful nothing before seeing the universe turn into the most beautiful fractals I have experienced to this day. 

After that he was completely gone to the point where I couldn't communicate with him and I was freezing so I went inside and sat on his couch staring at the off TV. His dad comes downstairs and asks me what I'm doing so I told him I'm cold and his sons on the trampoline, he goes out to check on him and 5 seconds later comes back asking me what the fuck hes taken because hes speaking gibberish running around the backyard with barley any clothes on. His mum comes down and says it's all good which was so reassuring and gave us beds and blankets then told us just to sleep.

 My freind went to the doctors the next day and he nearly went into a fucking coma that night. Were both still skeptical whether this is the same universe that we were in before we did that as he is sure that his hands look completely different to before and so do I supposedly. He isn't crazy and we talk all the time and I doubt hes just bullshiting and ever since that night everything has been different so who fucking knows.

I could tell the story about the time I did 2 caps and then knocked back 2 full glasses of vodka and around 5 cones but long story short I couldn't make 2 letters go together and the ambulance was nearly called, lots of vomit too and I woke up with THE most fucked hangover to exist ready for my second shift ever at my new job 😁😁

Just a month ago I was on 300ug of acid and got a youth caution from police officers for public intoxication and possession of a bong, ritalin and weed. Whilst tripping I also stopped my friend from committing suicide. The police officer whilst searching my wallet ran his finger through the exact spot where I had 6 tabs stored didn't realise this is the biggest blessing I have ever recieved to this day because he said if I had anything else on me it would have been a court date.

I know very well what I've done is stupid as fuck and I dont need you lot telling me how retarded I am I know alright

 my counselor diagnosed me with mild schizophrenia (runs in the family not suprised tbh) and I used to have the worlds shortest temper and lose my shit at barley anything( since the age of about 10) but after all this I no longer lose my temper or have any signs of schizophrenia

My childhoods been fucked up to say the least but having experienced shit like this at such a young age I think has matured me  greatly and I dont regret any of it it is what it is and I cant do shit about it

Idk I just felt like sharing wanted to see what other people would think because I've never really told anybody and I thought that people would find this an interesting read

And yeah I know my formatting and spelling is fucked sorry bout that.

Anyways thanks for listening to my retarded ass stories I could probably post a few more or then go into more detail of the ones I shared here because ALOT more happened in all of them but it would have been the worlds longest fucking reddit post if I had of put in all the details.

Cheers and sink one for me fellas.

12166,LSD,Acid flashbacks are a very real thing,"Ok so I have been going around reddit seeing a lot of people thinking acid flashbacks are myths but I promise you they are a very real thing. About 2 weeks ago I dropped 2 tabs around 100ug each and my trip was fine it was going great and my peak was how it always was (mind you I have taken acid about 12 times before in the past 3 years) and I got a great idea to go smoke some weed thinking it was gonna mellow me out. I did not know that weed has a type of synergy with phycadelics and completely enhances them for the worse. I smoked about .3 in my bowl and about 2 min later as I was packing another one I got hit with a rush of complete paranoia, anxiety, fear, panic, and a sense of I would lose who i am and never come back. Instantly ran inside to my girlfriend for comfort and ended up laying on the bed watching YouTube for about 2 hours just trying to hang on to reality. It was very terrifying but finally I started to come down and everything was feeling a lot better. 

I had about 2 more hours before I could rest but I felt so restlessness like I needed to go smoke not knowing about the synergy weed has with acid until I watched videos on it as I was smoking a very large bowl and after I finished my bowl I noticed the ground started moving intensely harder then it was before and it scared me because I thought I was reversing the trip and falling back into my scary trip. I quickly got up put my weed away and ran to the room (my girl fell asleep an hour before I went to smoke) and for the next 4 hours i tripped hard as shit. I tripped for a total of 13 hours. I got 3 hours of sleep and attempted to smoke again but the ground started to move slightly and I had the weird light body euphoric type of high rush through my body which of course after a bad trip scared the shit out of my and the paranoia from weed made it way worse.

 Through out the day I would have weird moments where I would slightly feel like I started tripping for about 10 seconds it's very very slight visuals and a very strong dissociated head and body high like acid. The next day I tried smoking weed again and felt fine I had no worries and could finally relax to a great weed high. But a week later I went to Disney and my vape died so I asked someone for a cigarette and sat down and just looked around and smoked but out of no where not even thinking about anything having to do with my trip, the strongest ""flashback"" I ever had hit me and completely threw my mind off. I quickly ran to my girl out of the smoking area with a cigarette still in my hand lol and sat down next to my girl and It started going away. Ever since then I'm always on edge about when I'm gonna experience the next one. I tried smoking weed one last time after I did a lot of research and seeing PhD doctors say flashbacks will either dissolve away or become controllable and it put me at ease so I felt like I could smoke without having to put my bowl down every hit to look at the ground to make sure it wasn't moving but because of the paranoia weed gives off I couldn't stop thinking about tripping which of course caused me to slightly start tripping so at that point i gave up and threw all my weed away and I usually smoke 2 times a day but now I dont smoke at all which could be a good thing I can save more money now. But now every day I will have random moments where it hits me out of no where I start slightly tripping with little visuals and a huge disccicociated body high usually only a couple seconds long but believe me the amount of terrifying things you think of in those couple of seconds is very very scary.

Now people who have used acid know what I'm talking about but after an acid trip you can always kind of make out the geometrical shapes in carpets or sidewalks after seeing them in a trip. Once you see the geometrical patterns in a trip you can see them or I guess come up with them in certain things and objects and whenever I focus on those geometrical patterns or think hard enough about my trip then I can kind of send myself into a flashback trip. At this point I'm controlling it when it happens. Whenever it rushes me I can usually stop it after a couple of seconds but now it's the point where every night I have that weird disccicociated feeling in my body it's small but it's their and I have to take melatonin to sleep seeing I cant smoke anymore. One thing I found that helps me out personally is drinking. I will take 2 big shots and be buzzed but I'm buzzed enough to focus my mind on anything else but my experience and I never have any flashbacks when I drink but unfortunately I dont like drinking and it's not good for you at all and I dont want to become dependent or habit forming so I usually just deal with how I feel every night until I fall asleep. It's not good or bad its just uncomfortable. I usually dont regret things but going out to smoke weed while on acid I regret big time and if I could take it back believe me I would. Flashbacks are a very real thing and I'm sure people will say I have developed HPPD disorder but people who have that disorder usually hallucinate things a lot more vibrantly. In my case my visuals are very small and the disccicociated light feeling in my body is huge along with a lot of confusion almost as if I have gone blank for a couple seconds. This is my experience which I have learned some things both good and bad. I realized how much of a dumbass I was for not researching before smoking on acid but at the same time I'm now saving more money instead of buying weed and I'm a little wiser and more cautious of a lot of shit I also seem more aware of just not my surroundings but anything outside of my surroundings if that makes any sense. I explained my experience the best I can and if anyone has the same experience and knows the best way to deal with flashbacks please let me know.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aevgvc/acid_flashbacks_are_a_very_real_thing/
12177,yourtexthere,"Humans are biologically wired to seek pleasure, and drugs are an easy go-to which is why drug use will always be a problem in any given society.","Something that you come to realize about the way the human body works, is that we’re all biologically driven to seek out pleasure in any way possible. Evolution has made it to where the things that we need to do to ensure survival feel the best. 

If you stop and think about it we’re all fiends for dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Whenever you eat something or you urinate your body releases feel good chemicals such as dopamine to let you know that’s something you’re supposed to do. The sole reason of life is to ensure the survival of your species through reproduction. This is at the top of our biological to-do list which is why sex is so pleasurable.

&amp;#x200B;

However, while it's fine to exist simply by experiencing creations made by others, one cannot thrive in our current society without making creations of our own, hence people go to school to churn out projects and assignments, get jobs to produce products and services, or create things through their own will.

Making creations of our own isn't better or worse than experiencing creations made by others, and the same goes backwards. **One does not hold a bigger value than the other**. It's just that the world we currently live in has labelled it as being ""lazy"" or wasting time.

12219,Alprazolam,How to taper off .5 mg of Xanax?,"I have had a prescription for Xanax for about 10 years and only used it very sporadically for panic attacks. Recently I went through a bad anxiety spell and my my psychiatrist told me to take .5 mg once a day until things settled down (this was about 7 weeks ago). 

About two weeks ago I started to experience severe panic attacks once my daily Xanax wore off (I think either from rebound anxiety or interdose withdrawal). I told my psych I want to taper off of it, but he told me to up my dose to 1 mg a day. I told him I don’t want to keep taking the Xanax daily, but told me it’s what I need right now.

I went to a new psychiatrist who told me to stop taking the Xanax altogether and I shouldn’t have discontinuation effects because .5 mg is a small dose. I tried to stop cold turkey and had the worst panic attacks I’ve ever experienced (non-stop all day panic, inability to eat, racing thoughts). 

I went back to my new psych and he said I can try to taper down by taking .25 mg in morning and .25 mg at night for a week and stop altogether, but so far the anxiety is unbearable. He said I don’t need a slow taper, but I think I do. How can I taper off of this?  I’m waiting to see a new psychiatrist for help, but that appointment is two weeks from now.

12233,Cannabis,My discovery of the dangerous power of weed and mental illness together.,"Beginning of text writing 15:20
My insane-felt experience of weed made me discover a main real dangerous that a lot of people including myself ignore, smoking weed with a mental disorder (especially dissociative reality).

You should never underestimate the high of weed and it’s variable consciousness as well as it’s capacity to alter your reality many times.
I might be psychotic but here I am, at 13:00 taking a 80 - 100mg edible hash brownie, for an hour ai’m mildly coming up but I just feel pretty high and tired, no real headspace really, so I feel like I have peaked at that moment, an hour and 20 minutes after taking my edible.
Turns out I was wrong, around 15:00 I was tripping like on an very powerful acid trip but also very different.
I am just convinced that this effect is due to an endogenous release of DMT in the brain that creates these wild shifts of consciousness, to the point I am in pure psychosis believing 100% what I am hallucinating.

I have shifted through different types of reality and dimension of things in parallel with our dimension, basically staring at something made me trip out in some crazy psychotic states of mind, not negative psychosis, just confusion and delirium of different dimensions and such. Update: 16:35 when writing this: I just spaced out extremely hard and experience a perfect view of my life after my body dies, I am in a INSANE psychedelic dimension that is just so strong in deja vu and feeling. I believe I saw life after death, I might just be a high delusional fuck, probably.

Don’t even do weed if you suffer from mental disorders that trouble your grip with reality or your awareness of existence. You need to stay in a very connected to reality state of consciousness so you don’t end up doing something really stupid while very high. This means you should seriously not get high on these consciousness shifting drugs because it’s DANGEROUS and can seriously make you lose the plot and end up at the origin of the universe, not a super fun experience but I accept it and go through it with no problem.
If your mind isn’t set, don’t do it, I swear it’s not worth having these insanely mind fucking trips.

12239,Opioids,My dumbass druggy mom and the first signs of her descent into opioid/polysubstance addiction/using me for pills. Bringing weed to Arizona. Eventually I was removed from the house after domestic violence went down and it became too much. Haven't looked back.,"This is less suited for /r/raisedbynarcissists, so here we go. I think my old posts are still up, I'm not sure I deleted everything a few times.    
          
This is really just a veiled post about how dumb my druggy mom is. My stupid mom was a little too bold with weed. White suburban moms I guess. She went off the deep end with drugs eventually, but this was a few years prior to that. Weed wasn't her issue, she's a polysubstance addict, opioids mainly. It gets a lot darker a few years later, but this was before it was out in the open.      
      
She ended up using me for pills for a number of years before I finally told her to fuck off and a whole domestic violence situation went down when my siblings started beating me up for calling her a drug addict. Left in a cop car and haven't looked back. I am just waiting for her to overdose already, she's sitting on a mountain of morphine and fentanyl she manipulated and outright stole from me over a period of over 2 years. She still gets scripts, still drinks on pills, etc.        
    
We flew to Arizona. Landed in Phoenix, got through the airport, landed and got a rental car. She was messing with something in her bag with a weird smile as we're picking up the rental car, I didn't have any idea what she had. I was super careful carrying about 80 coconut oil gel capsules of wax in a bottle of St. John's Wart. Got through no problem, wasn't even scared.       
       
We get into the rental car, her driving, me directly behind her in the driver side backseat.         
     
She's driving down from Phoenix to Tucson, it's pitch black out. She says nothing, just reached back between the seats.     
      
I see she's driving about 70 down the highway and between her fingers she's passing me a joint through the seats.           
      
Arizona has mandatory minimums. She's driving. It was fucking dumb.       
        
She had brought a bunch of joints in a q-tip container and a medicine bottle...just stuffed with buds.       
       
I know they aren't looking for drugs at the airport, but the cops in AZ certainly are.     
        
We didn't get pulled over the whole ride, the whole trip even. But we stopped at a truck stop, a state trooper was walking about 10 feet, maybe 20 feet away from us. This was the only time during the entire ride that weed wasn't lit.      
        
I'm so glad I got away from these people, pills became an issue and weed just became a side thing, but she never ever, ever drove without weed, a one hitter usually, but she just didn't care.     
       
We were up at Mt Lemon a few days later, me smoking a wooden bowl in the backseat, the bowl still lit. The car in front of us gets pulled over by a state trooper. I nearly shit my pants. I still freak out thinking about that.      
       
My mom seriously had me convinced I could smoke anywhere, eventually I got a non-criminal ticket here in NY for lighting a one hitter in the handicapped parking spot of a Chase Manhattan Bank in rich people land. That's it though.      
     
I have a card now, only ever use CBD/hemp products, but yeah. That was really dumb. She was really dumb. I really hope she gets a DUI already because she's always always always smoking and driving with pills on pills and it pisses me off.        
       
The opioids issue went much deeper, she had me taking absurd doses, lying to me about how they would work better and the side effects would go away if I just kept taking them, and she coached me before every single pain doctors appointment.      
       
Once I finally decided I wanted off opioids after nearly 9 months of being on them daily, I told my doctor and he pulled me off. He had been warning me that I needed to get a medical card or stop using opioids. Even when I was that dependant on them it was an easy choice. I told my mom and she demanded I stop smoking weed, piss clean, and go back to get the pills.   
      
That was the first time I ever called her a drug addict. She made me apologise to her in front of the entire family, basically buy into her denial.    
     
Because I had nowhere to go, was very disabled, (still am), she made me bite my tongue for two more years and kept stealing scripts out from under me the whole time.      
      
8 bottles of pills is what it amounted to, and 9 fentanyl patches. Thats what she traded me for.      
        
When I first caught her outright stealing 2 full bottles of Flexeril in September of 2017, my older brother beat me up for the first time. I should've called the cops then. He's an abusive piece of shit and I have voice and video recordings of everything.         
      
In August of 2018 she stole a benzo script out from under me again, and this time I lost it.     
        
Both my siblings started advancing on me, and I called the cops. They removed me from the house and I've been gone ever since. They still send me crazy emails, still try and manipulate me via email/text. But I'm safe. Nobody is stealing my scripts.   
      
I don't know how the fuck I'm not addicted to opioids. I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense. She set me up for a lifetime of addiction by age 18/19. She's a selfish fucking bitch and doesn't give a shit about her kids. Just getting high. She just saw me as a dope hook.      
       
The story goes on. I've told it before. I've released recordings, legal to do in NY.       
       
I've tried to get people to see what my brother did and what he's going to do to get girlfriend since he had no problem abusing me, and since his junkie mom backed up his abuse and said it was just justified.    
     
That house was a hellhole.       
    
Nothing could be else than that house.     
      
Not homelessness, not poverty, not anything.      
        
I'm still struggling every single day to get through life and get back on my feet.    
     
I'm still incredibly disabled, in and out of ERs a lot, losing motor function every day, but I'm not addicted to opioids. I don't know how to end this.   
      
These support communities saved my ass. The writing has been on the walls since 2016. But still. It took me 2 years t get out.    
      
I'll keep posting because I don't know what else to do. ",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aewqhi/my_dumbass_druggy_mom_and_the_first_signs_of_her/

Ran outta weed a few days ago, but it's no thing. What's really blowing my mind is how awesome my dreams are. I've heard that quitting weed cold turkey can cause you to get sick dreams, but I had no idea it would be like this. It's so vivid, and there's no disconnect. Everything flows so well. I've mainly just been going to shows of my favorite bands.  Last night I was at a king gizzard show, and it was better than when I actually saw them live. They were playing shit they'd never play live (fucking muckracker) and it truly felt like I was there. I also got to talk to my grandma. Haven't seen her in a long time, and I've been avoiding her out of shame. Having that imaginary talk was something I really needed. I usually go to sleep when my body is done, but now I'm kinda looking forward to going to the dream realm.

After a while it hit me and i felt really weird like i was in a trance and kept nodding ( which is something i hear is common when u do heroin) and i eventually decided to lie in bed and put on a podcast. I was in a weird trance of being half asleel and awake at the same time like my dream was fully real? The only tbing i remember is that i kept on feeling really light like i was gonna float then feeling heavy or normal weight again, i felt super comfortable and happy and the voices from the podcast (dude soup podcast if you know it) seemed as though ib my dream my friends were the ones talkimg as i forgot i was even listening to a podcast

Anyways just wanted to share i had basically np hang over the next morning where i usually do sith codeine. Can anybdoy relate? Is there something i can dl to make it even better or safer? Am i damaging my brajn badly?

then empty rig and fill it with a cup of rubbing alcohol and 1/4 cup of epsom salt and shake thoroughly

I’ve stopped smoking since then and have only had a total of about 5 tokes in the past year, i don’t really have an interest in smoking it again because it brings nothing but mental pain...even from one toke I go into this scary perception of the world, and if I’m in a group of people when they’re talking i hear everything in a really creepy context, instead of hearing things for how they are, I hear the same words but as though they are sneakily directed at me or about me.
For example: (one friend to another about new job) “it’s bad isn’t it, I couldn’t handle that!” 

My brain (hearing the exact same words but the quotation is how I perceive those words): “you can’t handle this feeling, it’s really bad, you’re not enjoying it are you...I can tell”.

12294,Dissociatives,a quiet addiction to nitrous,"i did nitrous about a year ago and never really had more of a problem with it than i had with other drugs - i don’t get addicted to things, at least not mentally. i started ordering more and more. i’m barely 18 and i live with my parents, and they don’t open my packages or ask questions. the past few months, due to little access to other drugs, i started ordering more and more. i do it quietly in my room - don’t use balloons, except to hold an extra bit that i’ve exhaled. almost never use them to trick my brain into thinking i’m breathing oxygen. i thought i was so smart. i thought if i could try meth and coke and vicodin and never get addicted, surely a stupid inhalant would never get to me. but the addiction crept in quiet and slow - i started feeling like i needed it, getting paranoid, having “premonitions” of my own death. (nitrous oxide is often associated with deja vu). maybe i sound pathetic, weak, even just privileged. nitrous is an expensive addiction to have. but it’s the only thing i’ve ever tried that i can’t say “that’s enough, i’ll stop for now”. i don’t know how to tell anyone that this is happening. i hate hospitals. i hate doctors. i hate when the people i love know how i really feel. but i need to get help for this before it damages my brain. the only talent i have is art and if i lost the motor control in my hands i would kill myself. i’m going to try to make an appointment with a neurologist to see how deep i already am. i don’t know what to do until then, though. if anyone has advice, just please, don’t be mean. i know i’m a complete moron. i’m breathing in laughing gas while crying, but i can’t stop until every last canister is cracked. i feel as if i’m watching myself die over and over and the solution is so simple, yet so difficult.

12296,Benzodiazepines,Xanax hangover or I am just retarded?,"So yesterday I was planning to have a chill evening (take 3 or 4 2mg xans, one every hour or so). In the morning when I woke up it felt like I had the best sleep in a while but still felt a pretty strong xans effect. I did my calculations and found out I actually took 6 2mg bars XD and I don't even remember taking that many (lost count after the first 3 I took lul). Considering the half life of xans is about 12h, would you say its just the remaining xans in my system that is making me feel such effect or could it be something else?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I did take xanax before (about a month or two ago) but I don't remember any similar effects. Maybe because back then I didn't have much going on but now I have exams in a week's time so could that have some impact on it? Like being more anxious/stresses and feeling that I need to revise after I wake up instead of just chilling and doing whatever...

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I don't have any 'diagnosed' medical conditions such as anxiety, bipolar or depression, but I do suspect that I may. I am a very antisocial person and generally dislike contact with other people. I just don't abuse drugs or anything like that, they just help me to relax and ease the pain.

Of course this ignores the fact that meth is more addictive than mdma.

12345,No Effects,Extremely High Tolerance to every drug I've taken,"Hi all,

Just need some help in understanding why I have an extremely high tolerance to every drug I've ever taken.

Now, I'll give some examples;

I've taken high amounts of morhpine, started small, and now I'm well past the LD50 taking 60mg rectal and 40 Oral. Even with this dose, I barely feel a thing, and this isnt a tolerance build up as I wait at least a couple of months before redosing. I've even done some stupid things to help increase the effects, taking alcohol before hand, Grapefruit, Diphen, Gaviscon, all at the same time to help potentiate the morphine.

I've taken high amounts of Ketimine, enough to make everyone else KHole, not me, barely feel a thing.

I dont get drunk of Alcohol, I need a least a full bottle of Vodka before I feel ""drunk"".

First time doing Phenibut , took 4G, didnt feel anything, redosed, didnt feel anything.

Taken many different doses of Kratom, dont feel a thing.

Taken many different doses of Fentanyl, dont feel a thing, just makes me vomit.

Taken high doses of MDMA, I get slight buzz, thats it.

Taken high doses of Cocaine, just makes me feel like Ive had a coffee.

Taken high doses of Speed, just makes my heart fast.

2CB, did have an effect on me, in a high dose.

Shrooms did have an effect on me, in a high dose.

LSD did have an effect on me, in a high dose.

Many more drugs that I have taken, that dont have any effects on me.

I have just taken Clonazolam, first time trying, strong dose. been waiting 6 hours, no effect so far.

Weed on the other hand, because I've taken ACID and Shrooms, gives me more of a psychedelic effect.

Sorry for the rant but Im just annoyed that I cant enjoy these things the same way other people can.

For the record, I do my research on each drug I take, and I wait the maximum time for the tolerance of the drug to completely diminish.

Any ideas as to why I have such a high natural tolerance?

turns out my friend when we got back he was like “lulz there was hella k2 in there”

12419,Psychedelics,The time I went to church on shrooms,"I saw the post about eating dinner while tripping so I decided il post my story. This happened when I was 16/17 years old. One Saturday night I slept at my friends/plugs house. On Sunday morning I woke up and was just chilling on the couch waking and baking, like I usually did when I was there. I was by myself wondering where this dude was... All of a sudden he comes running down the basement stairs with a mason jar full to the brim with shrooms. He offers me a half 8th to test them out  and of course I take them. (Thank God I didn't take more) 

free shrooms are free shrooms. 

I Take the shrooms And I wash down the nasty flavor with some oj. The shrooms start to come on and I'm feeling nice and wavy. I get a text from my mom. Hey hunny church at 11😘.... ffffuuuuuhhck I forgot about church.... I get a ride back to my house and I stare at this  turquoise tilw aztecian mask for what seemed like hours. (It was like 5 minutes) I was just waiting for it to say something. He never did. How Rude. 


Anyways I end up going to church with my mom and dad. At first it was actually strangely relaxing when the preist was speaking. being in room a full of people who were so respectful was pretty cool. Half way through I'm starting to peak, and when the whole of the church would respond I felt like was in a straight up cult. Hearing ""I am not worthy to receive your blood and body"" isn't something that sits to particularly well when tripping. No biggie though, I've been to chruch so many times it was just whatever. 

The whole time I was just trying to focus on the ground/my legs so no one would realize I was trippin. Whenever I would look up to the alter it looked like it was like 1000s of yards away. It just keep streching further and further away. I stopped paying attention to the alter and continued to study all the art. 

At this point everything has a high contrast, and saturation. Also there are some ripples, and very slight  geometric patterns.  The sculptures, the paintings, and the stain glass windows were so beautiful. I also was trying to communicate with the sculptures with no avail. I really wanted them to come to life like night at the museum. Eventually church is over and everything is well. Besides some of the strange group responses  said in Catholic churches. It honestly wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. All the art really helped me stay occupied. It also helped I didn't have to really communicate with anyone.",92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aeznbw/the_time_i_went_to_church_on_shrooms/

I wasnt planning on tripping that night but I said fuck it and swallowed one, the come up was pretty steady, just watching the office become more and more funny while the sides of my vision started to creep with fractals and patterns. Once I really started to trip I felt amazing, I was happier than ive been in a good while and everything felt more meaningful. I decided to smoke a doobie on the porch and afterwards I was so caught up in singing along to the beatles and starring at the stars, that I got up and started walking around the neighborhood, I was gone from my house for about 25 mins but I felt like I was walking for hours, my surroundings slowly fell apart and merged with my consciousness, I felt connected to every biotic and abiotic thing around me and I was no longer a body, just a consciousness observing, anyone gotten any feelings like this off of just one tab?

This was 3 months ago and I cannot remeber every single detail but stilk fresh.

I'm a pre university and I was at this moment in your life when you have to choose what you will become and you don't know anything about life so you start exploring feelings and points of view, what should I spect from life and all those things that bother the human actual existence. My mindset before the trip was quite shitty because I was overcoming an existential crisis that fucked me up with all those questions about what is real and what's the sense of being here, I got ""despersonalizated"". So as I said before I was overcoming it and I was like moodless (neutral).

After class, my close group of friends took the blotter in the way to (let's call him) Joe's house. We were like 10 minutes away and it was 3:30. Also this day Joe was doing a house party (+20 people i didn't know). Never done lsd before and didn't know how it was going to kick in so me and my other two friends where anxious because Joe said all the people was going to come at 5 (around this hour we were supposed to peak, so this was like the little paranoia of the trip). So I had this blotter and a quarter (125) in my mouth for 10min.

4:10
The effects started kicking 40 mins later while I was eating some pasta, some kind of euphoria because as I was looking some oranges the patterns started to kick in. (I can relate this to the begging of a weed high when you realize you are getting high). The act of eating started to feel kinda weird because I felt all the muscles in my head working to do my purpose and the flavour of the pasta got weirderer, it was changing with my perception of the environment; if something changed, the flavour changed. (Normally with music happend a lot during the trip). At this point I completely forgot anything about Joe's party and went to upstairs to try to put something in the tv. We were in a rushing to put YouTube and search for a thing to watch because at this point barely we could understand how a tv works and the meaning of the tv in the room. Finally we made it to put a documentary about wildlife and chill on a sofa. The euphoric mind state stood there while the mind space got bigger and bigger. My friend, Paul (not his real name) at that point was euphoric AF and was saying things like ""I'm so happy of existing"" Or ""I really like to exist"". Mark (the other guy) said that he experienced an ego death, it wasn't or I least what he said didn't seemed to me like an ego death (very short time laying facing the sofa). Some Joe friends started showing up and one of them was aware that we were on drugs so he became like a ""tripsitter"". As it was very weird that some guys that were going to party that night  were watching some wildlife documentary, tge tripsitter changed this to Thriller (Michael Jackson) and as long it is a ""scary"" audiovisual I didn't realized till the scene of the transformation to a werewolf, also because they just said ""scary"" And that word literally fucked me up and felt like this anxious sensation in the stomach (me and my friends) the next vid wasn't better because it was like a rave with a lot of clowns (i don't have any phobia) but it was a very ""dark"" video. 

6:20
At this time I was tripping balls and went to a roof in a kind of guest house and saw like black moho on the top (it was flat). That was one of my best OEV because all this black lichen was moving like an ocean flowing. Paul has a good connection with insects and I don't really understand why but there was a black milpede in the floor (where I live they are very common and usually measure no more than 3cm also they are totally inoffensive) so Paul took it and started to play with him. It went very bizarre when we brought some honey and he took it puted on his hand and started to lick Willy the worm. Then he putted it on his tongue and I was really thinking that he was going to eat it, but nah. He kept Willy the worm till coming again upstairs (in lsd takes a long time to get down of a roof, enter in a house a go upstairs, it surprised me when I saw him carryng Willy like if it was his new friend). 

6:40
At that moment I was laughing my ass off because when I look from a window to the street I see a lot of girls comming (inside of my head I was like: Fuck Fuck Fuck that damn party and I still tripping very badly). (Also I'm not very good at having conversations with girls because I'm a little shy) So all of this started to kick in my head I mean, I could have stayed all the time upstairs because it was like a ""safezone"" But Joe obligated us to go to the party and met people while I couldn't distinguish wich was my reality. It's true what they say about mirrors, it's a weird sensation to look yourself at a mirror while tripping. Went for a walk with the boys and the ""trippsiter"". I saw the clouds fading coloros but very slightly. Also had some paranoid thoughts about us getting murdered as it was quite dark and we were in the countryside tripping hard. (nothing special, just a tought that made me want to come back to the security of the house as we were quite far).

7:00 
Don't do drugs. Drugs are bad and you are not going to feel comfortable with strangers in a party. Just joking. It's true that I wasn't comfortable because there was so much information that I couldn't procesate at that moment and I didn't knew about what the fuck anybody was saying because the too damn loud music. Paul wanted to go upstairs as he was becaming anxious. Asked for the house keys but didn't got them till 20mins later. Once we were upstairs, Paul started (i think that wasn't a bad trip but a existencial one because he suddenly said that he felt what was feeling being dead as his vision turned black and everything went very small, also this happend because Paul and my friend smoked weed. I didn't smoked weed because I wanted to know how was a lsd trip with no additives. So he started to grab his head like he was being so overwhelmed. I was emphatic because i knew what was this sensation but in sober. And efter that in the trip I felt very neutral, not euphoric, not sad. Just flowing the last 5 hours of the trip. Paul's reality just cracked and he only knew who he was because it's wrist watch and that we were there but at this point, like I in the past he looked completely crazy. So we did a what to do plan. 
-Go back to the party
-Get some alcohol (not me because i wanted only my lsd)
-Try to relax till the alcohol kicked
And so they did, everything went better and we ate pizza for dinner (still that strange sensation) I was still lost af in that party but ok. 

12:30 
People start to go and stayed like 20 guys that i didn't knew. There was also a very drunk girl that was insulting every single life being in that party, looked very retarded to me. (She stayed later and make fun of a class friend that also came but later about shipping them together, how was his family to be etc...). After that I sat on a sofa/chair and stood all the rest of the night there. I still tripping. (I sat on that chair for 2 hour before going to sleep because I was paranoid with the fack that someone would steal my place and had to sleep on the floor.) What is funny about that is that it was cold and I was very uncomfortable sleeping on that chair so i didn't sleep. Felt like shit the next morning. 

This trip to me dured almost 30 hours because happend a lot of things after class and I don't understand how all they fit in the time gap 3:30-2 am. Also made conclusions about life, the afterglow wasn't that good but it really helped me to understand things in life that I wasn't aware of. What we are compared to the universe is nothing but we still be something, with our thoughts and our emotions, the beautiful evolution of life, our senses to perceive the environment, it's so much and so well done that i cannot explain, is chaos, but paradoxically, perfect chaos. Nowadays I'm doing better and I feel myself again. Sorry for any grammatical mistakes, English isn't my main language. 

 Edit: I call him the "" Tripsitter"" Because he was the one that was taking care of us and making the meals.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/af07ra/first_time_lsd_125ug_trip_report/
12458,Safe Use,Phenibut Safe Use Guide,"I put a lot into this, If you have any thoughts or questions, please let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

**Chemical Name**:  β-Phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid

**Chemical Classification**: Gabapentinoid

**Drug Classification**: Depressant

&amp;#x200B;

**Brief** **Overview:**

Phenibut is a legal (as of writing this) psychoactive drug in the United States and has quickly gained popularity over these past few years as a nootropic and anxiolytic drug. It's chemical structure is very similar to GABA and works primarily by acting on GABA-B receptors as a full agonist as well as blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs).  It *typically* acts in the brain as a stimulant in lower doses, and as a sedative in higher doses. (Despite being classified as a depressant)

&amp;#x200B;

Since the 1960's, phenibut has been used in Russia as an approved prescription drug for large list of psychiatric conditions that usually involves stress- It is also prescribed for ADHD, stuttering, and vestibular disorders. Everywhere else, phenibut is usually used as an unapproved drug for its anxiolytic, depression-reducing, mood-boosting, motivation enhancing and pro social effects.

&amp;#x200B;

It's primary uses are as an anxiolytic, sociability enhancer, nootropic, sleep aid, and to support general well-being. (At this time, there is very little evidence to support it being a nootropic, more on this down below). Unlike many popular, legal drugs; phenibut has clinical studies to support its functions. However, some of these studies have been called into question regarding their quality. Despite this, Phenibut has a generally accepted anxiolytic and sleep promoting qualities. With less evidence supporting ADHD/ADD symptom reducing effects and little to no evidence supporting nootropic properties.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dosing:**

*Dosing and timing of effects varies*, sometimes in a major way from person to person, always start with a lower dose if you ever decide to use phenibut. Phenibut can take a long time to reach peak effects, so don't attempt re-dosing if you don't feel any noticeable effects. Always use a scale to know exactly how much you dosed.

*Low: 250-500mg*

*Common:*  *750-1250mg*

*High:* *1500+mg*

&amp;#x200B;

*Onset*: 1-3 hours

*Come up*: 1.5-3 hours

*Peak*: 3-4 hours

*Offset 4-6 hours*

Durations vary sometimes to an extreme degree from what's listed here.

***Noofen dosing guidelines***: [https://olainfarm.al/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Noofen250mgtab\_Package-leaflet.pdf](https://olainfarm.al/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Noofen250mgtab_Package-leaflet.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

**How to take:**

Phenibut's effects can be modified and amplified depending on how you take it. Here are some common guideline:

1. Wait two hours after eating to dose.
2. Wait one hour after dosing to eat.
3. Coffee seems to reliably increase the effects and decrease onset time.
4. Exercising also reliably increases the effects

You'll find many opinions and post about different potentiating techniques, and they may or may not work. What I provided above, while not an exhaustive outline, seems to have the most reliable effects.

&amp;#x200B;

**It is not recommended to take phenibut more than once to twice a week max. Physical and psychological dependence are risk factors with phenibut, as with most GABAergic drugs.**

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: Kratom reliably increases pro-social and mood-boosting effects, but does seem to increase the likelihood of nausea.

&amp;#x200B;

**Effects:**

Your experience with phenibut could be drastically different than the effects listed below. This is *not* a comprehensive list, and dosing higher will not always boost the positive effects. Some of these could be switched depending on your goals. Most negatives are associated with abuse or overdosing.

&amp;#x200B;

*Positive:*

Anxiety Reduction

Mood enhancement

Music enjoyment

Increase in cognitive effects that are associated with anxiety.

Sedation in higher doses

Stimulation in lower doses

Pain reduction

Disinhibition

Decrease in ADD/ADHD symptoms in lower doses

Empathy enhancement

Psychedelic drug enhancement - Comes from reducing anxiety, therefore reducing the chance of a ""bad trip"".

&amp;#x200B;

*Negative:*

Nausea- Can be mild to extreme with waves of nausea and vomiting than can last hours. Almost always associated with overdosing.

Physical and psychological dependence- Starts manifesting when dosing daily, or near daily dosing. Perhaps the biggest downside of phenibut.

Cravings

Dizziness

Urinary retention

Cramps

Dehydration

Mild respiratory depression- can be amplified with other depressants to a fatal level when high enough doses are used.

Chasing initial feelings one use to get with phenibut in early use.

&amp;#x200B;

**Potentially** **Dangerous Combinations:**

**D*****epressants -*** Large doses of benzodiazepines, opioids, or alcohol can increase respiratory depression. Blackouts are more common than with the substances alone. Vomit aspiration possible.

***Dissociatives -*** Increases chances of vomit aspiration due to increase in nausea and chance of unconsciousness.

***Stimulants -*** While not as dangerous as the first two, these drugs can mask intoxication of each other, resulting in an excessive intoxication risk.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tolerance and Withdrawal:**

Phenibut builds tolerance extremely quickly, with as little as two consecutive days. I would highly urge you to regulate your use to twice a week, if not, less. If you do find yourself dependent, taper your dose down.

\*Slow Taper: -\*25 mg/day

*Medium (Recommended): -50 to 75* mg/day

\*Fast taper: -*100 mg*/\*day

This could vary from person to person, it's perfectly fine to taper slower. Usually, tapering can be done quickly in the beginning with larger doses (2000mg+) , but then slow as you reach lower doses. (1000mg) However, this may not apply to you.

Some doctors may prescribe you Baclofen to help with the withdrawal; in rarer instances, they may prescribe you a longer acting benzodiazepine. Take care you don't become dependent on these medications.

&amp;#x200B;

*Some red flags you may be starting a addiction*

1. *You rationalize taking it more frequently*
2. *You convince yourself you need it to do things you could before phenibut. (Like socializing)*
3. *You resort to using phenibut during a stressful situation when you've already used up your set amount.*

*Phenibut withdrawal symptoms*

Depression

Anxiety

Nightmares- Caused by REM rebound.

Hallucinations- Can be severe after waking, especially after a nightmare.

Delusions - Sometimes this can manifest itself with anxiety to form a mild delusion not associated with hallucinations. (e.g. ""My boss hates me and is going to fire me."" or ""I'll be like this forever. I damaged up my brain."")

Insomnia

In severe cases; Delirium.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Common Misconceptions/Unsubstantiated Claims:**

***Phenibut is a nootropic -*** Phenibut may seem like a nootropic and is even marketed in Latvia for cognitive decline, but most evidence suggest the cognitive boost is an indirect effect from anxiety reduction.

***Phenibut increases dopamine -*** There is next to no reliable sources that cite phenibut increases dopamine to a clinically significant degree. It's true it may increase dopamine matabolism, but this is counteracted by its inhibitory effect.

***Phenibut increases GH (growth hormone) -*** While it's true some gabaergic drugs increase GH, there is no credible consensus that phenibut increases GH.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quick** **Chemistry:**

Phenibut is extremely similar to GABA in terms of chemical makeup, being a derivative containing a phenyl group in the β-position. This chemical difference allows it cross the blood brain barrier so it can produce its depressant effects.

Most Phenibut is sold is Phenibut HCl, which is an extremely sour tasting salt that is easily dissolved. Hydrochloric acid reacts with the phenibut to create phenibut HCl. When you see dose charts, they are usually referring to the HCl version, although dosing is pretty similar.

The other commonly available form is FAA, which has about 20% more phenibut when compared on a mass basis to HCl. The FAA version of phenibut is nearly ph neutral, non-crystalline, somewhat bitter, and is slower to dissolve than phenibut HCl. When in the stomach, it converts to phenibut HCl. This form of phenibut is suitable for sublingual or intranasal use; which some reports claim phenibut is faster acting and stronger.

It helps me out in focusing my thoughts and being in the here and now. It helps me think clearly about the person who I want to be and also act on it.
Before using it I had never understood that this could be an effect, but I love speed for it. This effect also helps me ration it well so that I get most of the positive effects while minimising the negatives.

Such a nice body high going on right now, my bed is insanely comfy! Anyways to my point, my mom bought me this travel eye mask that actually vibrates softly and you can play music in. It’s literally like an amazing experience right now it’s crazy lol I don’t know if it’s just because I’m super stoned but like this is awesome😂 

also, the playlist on Spotify called Chill Vibes has some pretty trippy and smooth songs to listen to when you’re high!!

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a hood with a lot of drugs. Occasionally I will see a baggie on the ground with something in it. I might stop and look at it or I usually just walk on..

&amp;#x200B;

I just now found a baggie on the sidewalk and ... uh.. it looked different.   It looked ""chunky"".

&amp;#x200B;

I poked it with  my finger. The angel on my shoulder told me to leave it be. The devil said.. hey this is different this time!  Better grab it.

&amp;#x200B;

Why this might be an interesting post is like I said, I am not really a meth guy and this has to be the most meth I have ever seen in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I am usually worried about fent so I avoid all white powder but this stuff, I got it home and it looks like 2 big chunks of salt. I was like holy fucking heisenberg.

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to post on here and ask what I should do with it but the more I looked, the more my hands started shaking.

So Yeah, smoked some. It is indeed meth. Really smooth too. You got to remember that I have probably never gotten a  good deal on meth.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I do have a question.  I am really broke right now and  I am just a novice but this has got to be alot.  I wold guess maybe 200 dollars worth.

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of want to sell some but I know no one who would buy it and if I told the guy who normally rips me off he would just come over here and flim flam and mooch.  He is a hard core druggie.   I am sure he woulld steal it he could.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I take the chance of selling to someone I don't know?  That seems like a bad idea.

&amp;#x200B;

This is way more than I need. this looks like rest of month bender and I don't want to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I still do have a question, besides smoking it, what can I do with it?

This is an old acct too.  I know sometimes like to see other posts to see if the guy is legit.  My main acct ,, well, I am actually in recovery.  My thing is booze though

12516,Cannabis,"Let my friend try an edible for the first time, he ended up crying and calling his parents","I have a friend who until recently had never really done any kind of drug whatsoever, and decided he wanted to try some weed.  We went to my house and I let him smoke one of my prerolls.  He smoked a considerable amount but said he didn't feel much from it, so I gave him an edible.  Now I was excited to see if it would chill him out (he has a very hyper personality), though somehow it ended up making him more hyper.  About an hour and a half or so later he started manically laughing that he had ""baby hands.""  We took my dog for a walk through the neighborhood, and he was very vocal about how excited he was to be high.  Said trying weed was one of the best decisions that he ever made.   

at some point I semi jokingly mentioned that I had actually hoped the weed would help him find his chill, and he started getting really apologetic about his hyper state.  I felt kinda bad and tried to back track a bit.

“Dude it’s alright, who cares what I think,” I said.  “I CARE WHAT YOU THINK” he said a bit dramatically.  Okayyyyy…. He continued acting apologetic and I kept telling him it was no big deal.  

Few minutes later we were back at my house and he was video chatting with some of his online stoner friends, excitedly telling them that he got high.  Then out of nowhere he asked them “hey if you cut yourself while high would you feel pain?”  They were like uhhhhhh yeah don’t do that, and he seemed to fall back into the upset mood he was in before.  

He continued to go on about how he was sorry for how he wasn’t chill (and I kept trying to reassure him) and he started complaining that he didn’t feel right, that he had made a mistake and that he never ever wanted to try drugs again.  Next thing I know he’s on the phone with his parents all teary eyed, apologizing to them for doing drugs (though it took him a while to say what he was actually sorry for).  “I’m really sorry, I made a bad decision, I’m at [my name]’s house, and it’s not her fault, don’t blame her, it was totally my decision, but I made a mistake and I’m really sorry… no no I’m fine, and I’m really sorry but I tried marijuana…” (you get the gist.)

I'm not saying I didn't have that done before but I'm asking bc some people saying you can get shyzopefriane or hppd ( I probbaly have that and I love it lol) or get a bad trip of wanting too much.

12538,Psychedelics,So I’m thinking that something in super B complex radically potentiates LSD,"A few weeks ago I decided to drop some acid, it was only 5 days after my last trip at 140ug, so I decided to go for 210ug to counter the tolerance

I have no idea what happened, but that turned into the most INTENSE trip I’ve ever experienced. 30 minutes in and i was already fully tripping somehow with visuals stronger than I’ve ever seen in my life; though, I’ve never done more than 300ug so I’m sure it could have been much more intense than it was. But for the dose and my tolerance, this was insane. 

Oddly enough, i came down about as quickly as i went up. After about 3 and a half hours the visuals had mostly died down and I definitely felt like i was on the come down phase (until i smoked, then i blasted off again lol)

The only thing i could think of that would have caused this radical change was that i took a super b complex maybe 4 hours before dropping the acid. To test this out, I’m going to try the same thing again tonight. I’ll take some super b complex and then a few hours later drop the same amount as before (i also have roughly the same tolerance right now as well). 

I’ll make sure to update this post if i get the same type of potentiation, or it may have just been a fluke. Who knows. My next problem would be that super b complex has like 15 different vitamins in it, and I’d have no idea which one (or combination) caused the reaction


*Post-Trip Edit:* okay so that was a bust. Fairly normal come up phase, -*really* started feeling it around 1 hour in. Nothing too crazy, just your run of the mill acid effects for the dose. From 1.5 hours to  3.5 hours i was very anxious and just overall uneasy and uncomfortable, so i took some xanax and later some valium as well. A couple minutes go by and a huge comforting weight of not giving a single fuck washed over my entire body. I planned on sleeping but the benzos (and later all the weed i smoked) kept me feeling really nice actually, so i stayed up pigging out and watching random shit on youtube. The next 5 hours were a total blur, i had no sense of time and it felt like maybe and hour and a half at most had passed

So, unfortunately i don’t have much to report back. I took the super b complex before tripping, but my trip was a pretty average one as far as the effects i felt. It was very anxiety ridden, but I’d chalk that up to my own paranoid mind sabotaging my fun lol",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/af1fyx/so_im_thinking_that_something_in_super_b_complex/

12596,Cannabis,Medical Marijuana Card and Probation..,"Hi all friendly reddit users! Today I have a question to ask pertaining to a legal case I personally am currently dealing with.

Last year, I attended a festival in Tennessee. I managed to get a citation, following 100 hours of community service, 2 hair follicle tests (1 in January and 1 in June of 2019), while having to also pay $6,000 to the state. 

I reside in Oklahoma, where I have been approved and received my medical marijuana card this month of January 2019.

My question today however, is simple. If I received my card - and take the test within Oklahoma (No parameters of where to take it were defined on my citation or in court) and show positive for THC, would this affect my case within Tennessee? I've previously asked my attorney in Tennessee. However, as it is a 'Money-making' system there with the festival on who they catch with what, all my attorney stated was that he would advise to wait until I have received my card, but I should also still provide a clean drug screening. 

This is a little bit confusing, as I have been told that because the agreement of my parole was to provide 2 clean drug screenings, would it still be considered drug use after it has been approved by the state of Oklahoma to be medicinal and I reside here?

12654,Cannabis,Help me figure out what was in an edible?,"So, I'm a Reddit old, in my early 40s. I've done very little by way of drugs. I smoked a little bit of pot like three times in the late 90s. In the early 90s when I was 18 I had the biggest, most horrifying trip from diphenhydramine--not recreationally. I was trying to be dead, and I came close. I've misused a Vicodin or whatever here or there, but mostly I stay away from drugs because I suspect I'd like them too much. Anyway, I ended up with what I thought was a homemade pot cookie. It came from somebody I very much trust (my MOTHER), but somebody else had gifted it to her. It was small, about Oreo-sized, and tasted like a stale, freezer-burned snickerdoodle. I got two but only ate one.

&amp;#x200B;

About half an hour after I took it, I suddenly felt like somebody had physically smacked me in the side of the head. After that, I started to feel like I couldn't move or breathe, though I could do either if I tried, just with a feeling of being a big step off from my body. I felt like the two halves of my brain were completely split apart. One part of my brain was flipping out, and the other side was observing rationally and narrating the situation. I was alone in my apartment, but I'm pretty sure that if somebody had been watching me they mostly would have seen me spend a few hours sitting on my couch staring into space with my mouth half open like an idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything seemed to be spinning, but not like when you're drunk. The room around me was spinning vertically, so fast that all I saw was a black blur like a whirling star field tipped on its side. I could make it stop if I tried, and it felt like making a fan stop spinning by touching your hand to one of the blades, but doing that was very difficult and got more difficult as time went on. I couldn't stand music or lights, it was all just too much. The freaking out side of me was pretty sure I was going to die and thought I should call 911. The rational side of me said that would be a bad idea and pointed out that I could in fact breathe just fine. On and on.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few hours, the spinning and freaking out went away, but I felt off for the rest of the day, and even the next morning. It took about 24 hours for me to feel completely connected to myself. I feel very sure that was not (or not JUST) pot. This was a couple of months ago, and I'm fine, but I'm still so curious about what I ingested.

I stole shoes, did drugs, flew through the sky, had sex and had a sick time. I woke up during the night a few times thinking “is this actually happening?”, then I’d fall asleep and enter into another lucid dream straight away.

12706,I :love: Drugs,I can understand the appeal of benzos now,"The benzodiazepine class has always been a class I’ve been interested in and read about but never really understood the appeal of it to regular users and even just users in general. Never really thought of myself to try any either.

The other day a close friend of mine gave me two 5mg diazepam and since I had a short day today (had a shorter work shift and I’m still on break for college.) I decided to take one, searching that a common dose was around 5 and considering I’m on the skinny side I’d thought that be an appropriate dose. When I first took it I felt a sort of heaviness in my legs that made me think I would instantly regret taking it, it could’ve just been placebo, but that subsided very quickly.

I’m not an extremely anxious person, but the social awkwardness and anxiety is there. I talked to people I otherwise wouldn’t have throughout my day and made some new acquaintances. Most interestingly, the car pool with my friends/coworkers showed me that sometimes around people I know I’m stressed and uptight when I shouldn’t be. After going in to work for a short amount of time, I returned home and listened to some records.

I wound up having an amazing day :) Definitely see myself trying more benzodiazepines in the future. 

Although, please don’t take this story as a reason to abuse benzodiazepines. Always be careful and take your drugs in moderation. I don’t plan on using any more drugs anytime soon, not even marijuana, as I have to pass a drug test for an internship. Remember life always comes before drug usage, moderation is key and always to research and be safe! These are the cliches but it’s important.

I took it right after eating some pizza would that delay it? Should i expect it to still kick in?


Tldr : me and my mate shared an xtc pill he rolling im not even feeling the comeup an hour and a half later? Why? I want it to kick in already 😐


Edit :  found this on some random yahoo answers shit

The effects (of mdma) can also depend on other characteristics of the person as well, such as the initial storage of serotonin on the brain.

I tried googling it but no luck 
It wasanyone knows what it means
Less seratonin stored less effect? Idk

12853,Cannabinoids,Weed wrecked my memory,"Roughly two years ago I got high for the first time using THC oil in an edible tablet. It messed me up so badly. I was hallucinating, had really awful balance, and just overall paranoid and felt like I was dying. I decided right then that I would never do drugs again.

My short term memory was basically gone for the entire next day but even my memories of that night were fuzzy. I decided I wasn't going to do drugs again and kept that promise until last week. I was extremely drunk so it was easy to convince me to take some hits off a dab pen my friends had. I have VERY limited memory of everything that happened after that point.

12875,storytime,My buddy cried after a cart hit,"Disclaimer - Driving high is not okay when you are in certain states, such as the one I was in. I no longer smoke anymore but this story just popped in my head.

tl;dr at bottom

Backstory - I'm a 16 year old junior at the end of summer, on a tennis team with my buddies. We're coming home from a match on the bus and everybody had too much energy and shit so we wanted to do something other than go eat somewhere. I was just telling my close friends, ""N' and ""R"", how I picked up a new cart and they wanted to smoke with me, so I was excited and I was like sure! Before, I made sure N could drive while he was high, and he's like ""yea dude I do it all the time don't worry about it"" and I asked him if he was SURE he could and he just kept saying he was fine. I told them to call their moms and say they were getting food or some other bullshit excuse you know. So we get in my car, N in the back and R in shotgun, and start driving and hitting the cart, blasting music in my sisters real old mini cooper with racing stripes 😅. All is going well and we're deciding where to drive to and I turn into a country club \~5 minutes away from the high school. 

N is a funny guy. Like a FUNNY guy. You know those guys that you just look at and you laugh because they're so funny? That's N. Just cracking jokes and doing FUNNY shit all the time. He let's out a ""guys, where are we"" like he's crying, like a super distressed ""guys, where are we"" and me and R turn around and just start DYING. It was the funniest shit he had tears running down his face and everything and we just thought he was joking. And he starts saying things like ""you guys don't even care!"" and me and R realized it was serious but that made it more funny. We were at a traffic light just bent over dying and i'm trying to help him I felt like an ass it was just so funny to see him crying in the back freaking out. It would have been way different if it was a different person, but as I said N is one of the funniest guys I know so to see him like that was hilarious for my high mind. 

We drive back to the high school and it was a STRUGGLE to get him out of the car. He's a somewhat husky dude and the back of my mini cooper is really small. He won't move because he's so somewhat scared and too high so we yank him out of the back and he hits his head on the top of the door frame. hahahahahaa that was pretty funny. When we got back we didn't know what to do to get him back home, so me and R were just laughing and trying to come up with a plan to get him home. This whole time N was saying stuff like ""You guys don't even are that i'm going to die"" and ""my life is ruined I have a DUI"" but i'm not a total dick and I helped calm him down. I just let him know shit was going to be ok and he's not going to get hurt and it's a learning experience but he's still crying and freaking out. We schemed up a plan to call his mom and say he threw up and was too nauseous to drive, so I drove him home with R On the way back home N drank a two whole gallon water jug type bottles, the ones people would drink for football, and still his mouth was SO dry. His tongue was sticking to his mouth and shit and he couldn't talk it was hilarious but we were nervous he was going to get caught. He sounded like a 5 year old with his incoherent words and extreme dry mouth. 

We pull into his driveway and he gets out the car, I tell him to just go straight to his room and he responds with ""my mom is going to know I have to tell on you guys i'm sorry please don't be mad at you"" in between tears and he shuts the door and goes inside. Me and R were like ""what the fuck"" and skirted the FUCK out of there. We were still laughing it was a ding dong ditch type feeling, but I felt bad for R because he was really scared he was going to get caught :(. I drop R off in his super confusing neighborhood, like 6 turns and shit, and I try to drive away. My phone was dead so I just kinda winged it and came out the COMPLETELY wrong exit and just started driving towards lights. I just kept driving and realized I wasn't going home or somewhere I knew so I just started turning down random ass streets I thought I knew. ""That street sounds familiar"", turning signal on. Eventually I find my way back and I get home and do the routine yadda yadda and go to bed.

The next day the tennis team is changing in our jank ass locker room (bathroom) and he walks in and me and R start dying again. N just goes ""I was fucking with you guys the whole time"" and we obviously knew that was fake so we give him shit for it and then just go on with our day. Overall a funny but kind of annoying experience, but now we're all more prepared for a crazy situation like that to happen again. I'm sorry if this was wordy or too long I guess i'm just a good writer? I'm pretty good in English at writing so uhhhhh yup i'm blaming it on that thanks English teacher you fucking bitch. It's fuck all female English teachers (for the most part) because they're all cunts who don't care about their students sanities. Thanks for reading! I guess I just typed this just to type a story also, have a wonderful rest of your winter!

tl;dr - Me and two buddies, R and N, smoked after a tennis match, N had a panic attack and couldn't drive home. Once I dropped them off I got lost as fuck for a while but returned. N said he was fucking with us the whole time, which was a lie.

12926,Psychedelics,4ACO-DMT trip,"I wanted to explain my wild ass adventure on this because I personally don’t think I’d ever be able to handle it again because of how intense it was. 

So I had a friend who gave me a little party pack,  4ACO just happened to be in it and I was like sure fuck it. 
I’ve never tried it before but my boyfriend tried it plenty of times so I was comfortable enough to do it with him. 

She put the powder in caps because we didn’t have a scale but ended up buying one that night because I didn’t feel comfortable not knowing how much the dose was. 

This girl must have been either fucking insane or just a really bad person because she put 100mgs in each pill. 
Mind you a HEAVY dose is 45mg+ 

I’m glad we ended up scaling 15mg each because I would have been so fucked up if I took that 100mg.

So I took 15mg and was hanging out listening to music and just started feeling the body load. I don’t dig body loads on drugs when I feel heavy or shaky it makes my anxiety just go over board but it wasn’t too bad so I was okay. My boyfriend took another 20mg because he has a higher tolerance then me, he was perfectly fine. I took 20mg with him just because I figured “hey this won’t be so bad” and boy was I wrong.

I took it and it was 15 minutes passed taking it and I said “this isn’t even that bad, I was expecting worse” 
I fucked up 

He told me “don’t disrespect the chemical” 
I fucked up lmao 

10 minutes after I started panicking. It was waaaay too much for me, I was seeing things shifting out of the corner of my eyes, visually I was nauseous and so overwhelmed I was laying down trying not to freak out. Then he noticed I was freaking out so that made us both freak out. 
Since my boyfriend has experimented with so many drugs he would usually be the first to be like “hey it’s okay it’s just the drugs” but he was concerned for me so that made me more nervous. (In reality he was just wayyy too high lmao) 
He thought I was dying or something, I at one point just went to try and stand up and almost fell over because of how drunk feeling I felt. My legs felt weak, I didn’t feel in control  of the situation. I came back after going to the bathroom and told him “I think I need to go to the hospital or something” 
I laid down and calmed down for a minute before asking him to just lay next to me, made me feel safe that I had someone near me. He turned the lights off and put a show on and I just closed my eyes. 

And this is when shit went insane.

My eyes closed, I saw blackness, but the outlines from everything in front of me still, except my boyfriends brightly colored shirt. I felt like I had my eyes open still then felt like I was floating up and seen nothing but his colorful shirt / the tv in my vision and black outlines of everything else. I felt weightless and I don’t know if I was actually breathing or not but he said something to me like “are you okay?” And I just fell down back into my body. Like literally felt like I fell onto the bed and shifted back into life. 

He finally hit up a friend who he knew was more educated and he said we just did a lot for the first time for me and that girls sometimes tend to experience it more intensely. 
Which calmed us down and at that point helped me start to come down from my trip. 

But that was the most intense high I’ve ever felt in my life and I don’t get how the fuck anyone can do that lmao ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/af4kp5/4acodmt_trip/
13003,Psychedelics,My First 1600 mic Trip,"(Long read) This little story starts in the worst year of my life.  Due to a freshly burgeoned mental illness (type II bipolar) I was living a fresh hell every day.  At this point in my life I had approximately 3 mushroom trips under my belt and maybe 1 or 2 solid LSD trips.  I didn’t know much about LSD other than it countered my extreme depressive episodes and put a stop to my constant suicidal planning (harm reduction note: don’t follow my example, taking psychedelics while in my mind state could have easily caused me to harm myself).  Armed with what little knowledge I had, I bought a sheet of acid and met a friend at some randos apartment.  Introductions were made and I quickly got down to business.  

We’ll call the rando Midge for writing’s sake, to this day I legitimately don’t know his name.  Midge was letting me and my coke addicted friend (who we’ll call coke pal) drop acid and do coke at his apartment in exchange for acid and coke.  He’d never tripped before, information I didn’t regard as important because of how inexperienced I was, this was a pretty big fuck up on my part.  Together me and Midge popped two 150 mic tabs, coke pal didn’t like acid but agreed to take half a tab with us.  About 30 minutes in and we’ve all been doing lines and waiting for the come up.  I get a text from my ex girlfriend talking about how her new boyfriend plays guitar or some shit and I decide I want to die.  I rip a fat line like an idiot and shove 9 more tabs into my mouth.  I’m being a sulky asshole so my friends continue talking and watching trippy YouTube videos while I try to keep my heart from exploding all alone.  

It’s been a solid hour and a half since we dropped and I don’t really feel anything.  Midge is laughing while waving his hand around talking about tracers, coke pal is excitedly talking about starting a business we can all work at and I’m just staring at the tv.  There’s this incredible image on the screen that I can’t really describe, there was this thing that had the texture of a very delicate flower, the whole screen was awash in red and white.  It was fluctuating in time with some music and it was extremely intoxicating for a reason I couldn’t place.  It took me a solid 30 seconds to realise my entire visual field had exploded into visuals so intense that I could barely make anything out.  Everything was crawling or melting or breathing.  

For whatever reason I began to believe that this video of a flower was trying to indoctrinate me into being a Nazi.  I started mumbling it and when no one would listen I spoke up,
“Guys, why in the fuck are we watching Nazi propaganda?”
Coke pal laughed and asked me if I was feeling it.  Midge was very quiet.  Coke pal, being the least trippy changed the video to something else and I was appeased for a while.  Sitting back I floated back into the visuals.  Until some Nazi bitch showed up on the screen 30 minutes later.  Well, she probably wasn’t a Nazi but fuck she looked like one at the time.  Screeching like a mentally impaired baboon I accosted coke pal for playing more Nazi shit.  By this time coke pal is laughing his ass off, trying to explain that it’s just a music video, on some small level I understand that but on a much larger level I’m having fun thinking everything is Nazi propaganda.  It’s making coke pal laugh, right?  And Midge, well, I can kind of tell he’s uneasy but everything is on the peripheral of my consciousness, I don’t recognise how unsettling I’m being.  

FFW about 30 minutes and I’m seeing Nazis everywhere.  In every video that’s being played, in the curtains, in the bubbles that formed when I flushed the toilet.  I can’t stop talking about it, I feel compelled to babble endlessly about Nazis even though coke pal is telling me to shut up.  Unsurprisingly (in hindsight), Midge abruptly stands and says he’s going to go lay down in his room.  After I watched him leave I never saw him again.  Oddly, after he left I didn’t give a shit about Nazis anymore.  Oh well.  Midge if you’re out there, my bad bro.  

Now it’s just me and coke pal, I should mention here that me and him go way back, it’ll be important later.  So coke pal is sort of disinterested at this point, we’ve agreed to slow down on the coke and he’s coming down kind of hard, doesn’t really matter to me though I’m fully engaged in psychosis.  There are voices and thoughts in my head whirling around in a never ending circle, they’re all in on some secret and every time I figure one of them out it leads to another.  I’m on the infinite loop thought train, breaking down nonsense into more nonsense when coke pal says we should finish off the last couple of grams of coke.  Me, unable to decipher what language he’s speaking fervently agrees.  

Maybe an hour later and my head/gums are numb.  I don’t know how much I did but my friend had a bit of a problem and I wouldn’t really have blamed him if he shorted me a bit.  I didn’t really feel the physical effects from the coke other than the numbness but my thoughts had started to become more rapid and more cyclical the more I did.  I was hunched over holding my head and speaking to myself in a low whisper when the music video for “Seven Chakras” by Ces Cru came on.  I’d never seen the video or heard the song but I watched it, enraptured.  It was at this moment I discovered my LSD fetish for facial expressions.  There was no deeper meaning or hidden message in the song but the choreography struck me as master class, I was literally in awe.  Then the song ended.  

I didn’t know how long I’d been in this ocean of madness.   I’d been battered by the waves of my mind for as long as I could remember, surely this would be the rest of my life.  I couldn’t really remember how I’d gotten into this situation, or why I’d done it, I was more concerned with staying alive.  Coke pal was chattering in the background and I was doing my best to respond but it felt as if there was physical strain on my body from the speed of my thoughts.  I could see *everything*, every single moment in time, past, present and future.  I was aware of where we were going as a species and what my own destiny was.  Unfortunately I was aware of all of it all the time, in my head was this undulating mess of everything that never stopped sending stimulus.  
“Shit, I think I’m dying.”
I didn’t say it out loud but I remember the thought hitting me for the first time in my life.  I was at peace with the idea, I just didn’t want it to hurt.  I stayed in that state for a long time, just on the verge of death lying on the couch quietly twitching while coke pal sat on the other side of the room silently engrossed in his phone.  

For the first time in a long time (making a guess at the time would be useless) coke pal spoke.  I didn’t know what he said but it broke my death concentration.  I opened my eyes and I felt my control slip.  I knew without that control I would die.  I sat up in an upright position, the universe sliding past me at breakneck speed.  I was gritting my teeth and struggling to keep my eyes open.  
“Here it comes”
I thought.   
“Sorry about leaving you with my body coke pal”
I genuinely regretted the problem me dying would cause my friend.  With my fists clenched and pressed into my thighs and tears rolling down my face I strained to listen to coke pals final words to me.  He sounded far away.  My heart was beating as hard as I’d ever felt it, I could hear my blood rushing in my ears, tribal music was flooding my consciousness.  Some weird thunder in the background, or maybe a river running? 

It was the toilet flushing.  As coke bro came out of the bathroom he did that thing where you snap with both hands and then clap your fist against your palm.  It made three audible clicks in the otherwise quiet room and my psychosis fell off.  I can’t properly explain how abrupt it was, one moment it was all I could do to keep from screaming in pain the next all that was left was an absolutely empty mind and a very slight visuals that left my world slightly rolling and bubbling occasionally.  A far cry from the world ending swirling melt of madness I’d been seeing just moments before.  It struck me dumb, I had never been able to think so clearly.  I looked up at coke pal to try and explain my situation but instead I beheld God.  Of course it was still coke pal but he had changed.  I understood him completely differently.  Around me time had stopped.  I could tell there would be no further distraction, I would be safe from harm or responsibility until this experience ended.  The room took on an odd quality.  I can’t really explain it but it was as if it was all that there was and every odd little detail about it had been perfectly placed.  I saw a stack of Midge’s school papers and I immediately knew their to be a story behind them.  Pizza boxes, overflowing trash, a bong, everything spoke to me, everything had meaning.  

It’s late now and this thing is getting long.  I’ll *probably* post the rest of this at a later date.  Anyway, if you read all of that, thanks, it really means a lot.

13070,Methamphetamine,High purity meth effects compared to lower quality?,"I've done ice a handful of times but i've always heard about the purity tests. I was told mostly shards and clear like glass are the best. But i've done some ice that was sold in powder and honestly sometimes it was stronger. I've noticed with some ice i used to get extreme anxiety and just nervous, but some ice i've done gave me a clean feeling. In my experience good quality ice, feels a lot cleaner and less dirty. Less anxiety and i've been able to fall asleep on it too, but still loads of energy but in a calm way. Theirs a lot of crystal out their that range from 30% to 80%, i was just curious from someone who has tried high quality batches what differences did you feel? I've done some ice where they break it straight off the broke, i've done fat white shards, clear ones, and even powder which I noticed doesn't always make one stronger than the other. I get a rush and don't need to use as much when I come across good ones. Sometimes it feels like good ass crack rush but lasts longer.

So basically I'm wondering does higher quality meth make you energized but also more calm rather than running around and going a billion miles per hour. Sorry the post was confusing, so what was the effects whenever you got ice, more mellow, less anxiety etc? Thanks! Oh and one time in mexico i did ice and I only smoked 2 big hits and was rushing all over my body. And other times i've done ice and have had upto 9 hits and very mild feeling. And I have a low tolerance never done it more than once a month.

I was hearing the doctors and nurses talking but I was vividly seeing my own version of what was going on outside my room.

13098,Cannabis,Does weed make you more empathetic and in tune with others feelings?,"A bit of context, I'm not diagnosed as 'on the spectrum' as people say but I definitely am not usually the kind of person that can deeply empathize with most people. I tend to say things that hurt feelings or ruffle feathers a little without any bad intentions, just saying what I think or feel and not considering how others may react. My lady is one of the few people that has historically been pretty tolerable of this and in fact has some of the same tendencies, maybe to a lower degree than me though.

My lady and I are agressively trying to quit weed at the moment and have been stone sober for about 2 weeks now. Now in that two weeks we've had a lot of arguments often over little shit but in the moment it seems like the world. The last fight we had resulted in me promising to try and get my emotional intelligence up to try and be more aware and understanding of what's going on with her. Eg: not giving her a hard time for not going to gym despite paying a weekly membership because she's really down about a failed job interview or being abused at her current job.

Today we had another fight and it just occurred to me how frequent these fights have been while we're off the wacky tobaccy. So is it likely that the lack of weed in our lives is making both of us more emotionally heightened and easily triggered? Have I lost some of the empathy I had over the last few years because of this sobriety?

I'm not looking for an excuse to get back on the stuff, that's not gonna happen. But if there is a possibility that could be contributing to the issues, I feel like I'll be better prepared to handle it.

Anyone else experience something like this after kicking trees?

13103,Cannabis,Got away from a pat down and a dog with weed on me!,"I’ve never been this lucky in my life. 

So I just got off work, bartending, was trying to go across the street to the bar that stays open later. Clocked out, roll blunt, head to gas station. A fight is about to break out. I watch for 5 minutes while hotboxing. They aren’t fighting, they’re just bullshitting. And I’m chilling here next to them while the cops are probably on the way. I need to leave, they’ll smell me. I dip. Too fast, the cops that were on the way see me pull out and immediate blue light. Shit. I pull into the bar’s parking lot, flick my blunt in front of my truck instead of out the side, stuff my quarter in my crotch and wait to get arrested. I’ve been in this situation before, just a year prior, I know what to expect from smoking and driving. 

The cop comes to my passenger window. Asks for my info and asks if it’s ok to search. I don’t consent, he walks away. Comes back and pulls me out. My weed falls out of my crotch and gets stuck at my kneecap. I try to kick it out of my leg under my truck, it gets stuck in my ankle. Cops immediately ask me what fell out of my truck and start looking around. I feel my weed in my ankle and know they haven’t caught me yet, I play dumb and innocent. 

K-9 unit pulls up. The dog obviously hits, my blunt is still burning in a bush. They find rillo wrappers galore. They know what’s up. I feel my hope leaving me. Body search. 

The pull another 5 packs of rillos out of my pocket, start making comments about it. They go down my left leg.. pats on the weed in my ankle. Lifts my pants leg up. I see the weed slightly dangle above my inner ankle. I wait for the “there it is!”. It falls out. They pat down my right leg. What the fuck is going on? They tell me I’m good. I step back onto the weed. I get my license and insurance back and drop it. Pick my weed up along with the license and insurance. Walk away. Drink beer. Went and found my blunt. Finished it.

I have taken fake acid before and I know what it tastes like and it isn’t what my friend is describing.

13138,GABAergics,How should I feel about being friends with someone I think might not be alive in 10 years,"Sorry for the lack of paragraphs I wrote this right when I woke up and was bothered enoughed to write this, but not enough to format it. I'm currently a senior in highschool and I smoke weed and occasionally do psychedelics with friends. I've tried oxy and hydrocone in the past when I broke my arm, and I didn't really enjoy it that much, because other than kratom I don't think opioids are really my thing.

 I never had too many friends when I was younger which has sort of led to a complex where I'm desperate to keep the friends I have now, and I'm willing to overlook maybe a little too much shit just because I want to be liked. I have a healthy main friends group now fortunately because when I started highschool I realized I was a lot more funny and likeable than I used to believe, and after trying psychedelics I find it easier to stay happy and sociable in stressfull social situations so I would say my life is pretty good right now.

 Me and my friends just sort of involve ourselves in the drug culture at our school, which is unfortunately a little too big because ya know, it's an underfunded city school with a lot of mental illness and addiction in the surrounding area, but we don't really consider ourselves a part of the culture because we just don't have the time or the desire to rip bong and hit juuls all day, but I have quite a few friends at school who I would consider to be immersed in that culture. 

One friend who I became friends with through chilling with my plug at his house, because they're best friends, is this sub's worst nightmare. Fortunately my plug's a good kid and wants to stay away from pills, it sucks that he literally smokes weed and spliff ALL day inside his bedroom, but it's sustainable and he's smart enough to run a tight but profitable business so I think he'll end up alright. This other kid Joe though I think honestly might be dead in within the next 10 years and I have no idea how to handle this situation, and if I should involve myself at all.

 He's very nice and friendly to people who aren't too judgemental, like me, but the kid's as dumb as a brick I have to be honest. I've heard him say that it's a ""myth"" that combing benzos and opiods can lead to an overdose. The guy takes drugs all day but has absolutely no clue how they work or how dangerous they are. 

I tried 1 xanax bar a week ago that I bought from him, and started discussing xanax with him, and he told me he's been taking a bar and a half every day before school to make it easier, and I feel like such a pussy but I didn't say anything about how I dissaproved of it and was scared for him, because while he is nice, he is the type of kid to take any criticism or advice as an attempt to control him or judge him (I'm guessing something to do with his homelife) and I'm sure he wouldn't want to be friends anymore if I tried telling him to change his life. I honestly don't think he knows how addictive benzos are or what the withdrawals are like. His complete lack of any harm reduction, and his obsession to down any pills he finds made me realize I honestly can't picture him grown up and leading a healthy adult life, and for a matter of fact I can't even picture him being alive in 10 years.

 This is the first time I've ever had a friend whose life I thought was in danger but I don't feel like I can do anything about it, because all that will happen is that he won't be my friend anymore and he'll keep on living the way he does. If anybody reading this post was like that in highschool, or had close friends like that, what are the chances they get better?

Has anyone tried Mephedrone with cocaine, or while coming down from cocaine ie. 1hr after the last dose?

I find that coke becomes useless after a few doses, and only prolongs the stimulation. I have also heard the same about mephedrone, not to mention the amount of Serotonin released would make for an extremely bad comedown.

How about something like a few lines of c over a few hours, then a couple of doses of mephedrone to finish of the night, once the cocaine has worn off?

Of course i'm only looking for anecdotal advice since There is barely any studies on Meph and definitely nothing about using it with, or after cocaine.

13318,Opioids,Potentiating Codeine,"#Codeine

Codeine is metabolized by the liver by 2 liver enzymes: CYP2D6 (to Morphine) and CYP3A4 (to Norcodeine). Codeine can also be called Methylmorphine.

The process trough which it is converted into Morphine by the CYP2D6 enzymes is a chemical process called demethylation (removes the methyl group from the chemical to result Morphine). This process can also be done by a person with a background in chemistry, but it requires extensive knowledge of chemistry and the right equipment to be done.

Most people can metabolize the Codeine with a yield over 5% of Morphine.

This yield can be increased by inhibiting the CYP3A4 enzymes and increasing the amount of CYP2D6 enzymes.

### Inducing CYP2D6 | [Full list here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6)

- Dexamethasone &amp; Prednisone (One study showed a 100% increase in CYP2D6 enzymes in the liver)
- Glutethimide (&gt;90% increase in CYP2D6 enzymes in the liver)

### Inhibiting CYP3A4 | [Full list here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4)

- Ritonavir (&gt;80% decrease in CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver)
- Aprepitant (50-80% decrease in CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver)
- Verapamil (50-80% decrease in CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver)
- Fluvoxamine (50-80% decrease in CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver) **[DO NOT COMBINE WITH COFFEE]**

The police have his phone, won't give it back clearly lots of evidence.  his funeral was just after the New year he has 3 young children sobbing at the funeral. Hundreds of people came. His friends denied that he took anything that night, they carried his coffin. 

Toxicology has come back he had an enlarged heart and an insane amount of cocaine in his system as well as several other drugs and alchohol impossible to hide, he even punched someone that night so would have been clear he was on something, he would have been very agitated yet non of his friends told the ambulance crew who tried to rescucitate him that he had taken any drugs. Maybe it would have helped him.

There's going to be an inquest in 6 weeks, it'll be in the papers and everyone will know and it will distress his wife and kids further they're trying to do the inquest on a quiet day when the journalists won't be there but it'll be unlikely.

He's left his wife in debt, My parents in debt, left 3 young children without a father,  as well as anotuer daughter he never met from cheating on his wife. his friends were cowards and protected themselves one of them even looked after the children whilst his wife went to the hospital. He was probably on drugs too at the very least he didn't disclose that my brother was.

So before you do any dangerous drugs just think about what can happen, my brother certainly didn't think it would happen to him he was only 36. He's left debt destruction and humiliation in his wake. His wife can't even have a happy memory of him as she found him on a dating site a few weeks prior to his death.

This is what can happen FYI.",32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/af9eyg/my_brother_died_of_a_heart_attack_before/
13374,Psychedelics,LSD 600 mcg - MAXIMUM SENSATION,"Damn, this was something unbelievable. I usually keep my mind clear of anything and just listen to music on psychedelics and let the beings show me whatever they want. Usually it's etheric forms moving in the rhythm of the song, or images of dancing women on the walls which is followed indescribable mental formations.

But this time the physical senses completely melted. I've tried many drugs including all the ""good ones"" and I have to say nothing comes close to this. It didn't matter if my eyes were open or not, I don't think I even remembered what eyes or any senses are, where one ends and other begins. The beings that give form appeared and it was absolute pleasure, maximum sensation, a glimpse of the absolute reality.

Later I just let things flow and watched things grow, plots and characters, emotions, intentions, successes etc. Universes starting and ending. Things that make complete sense in their own cosmos and then completely disappear from cognition.

All in all, very cool experience. Started it by eating a vegetable noodle soup, was quite annoyed by the fact that most soups at the supermarket were for corpse eaters.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/af9hg2/lsd_600_mcg_maximum_sensation/

13421,LSD,Acid is really something maaan,"*trip report* : So last night I was out with my friends K and T and we started off the day planning to do a little L and ended up taking about 1/3 of a tab of ALD-52. Later on that night, after a few noz sessions, K left and he sold me a few tabs, which I planned to save for another time. K was being a little controlling throughout the day and told me not to do any more so i decided that T and I should pop another tab and live on the edge a little. We pop these tabs and they hit us pretty strong. Like... we’re basically tweaking without visuals about 2 hours in. In my moms house, we have an Apple TV downstairs and it has one of those little remotes. I’ve asked my mom if we had another one on several occasions because it’s been acting funny and every time she’s told me that I just have to deal with the broken one. So we’re sitting in this room, nothing makes sense, reality feels a tad bit broke, and my tweaking ass decides to look to the right. NOW I SHIT YOU NOT. I look over, and there are TWO WHOLE REMOTES. I let out the most horrendous and insane scream that has ever escaped me, and T realizes what’s happening and we both slip into the most horrifically blissful laughing fit I have ever experienced. I was seriously sitting there... balling my eyes out puffy over TWO damn tv remotes. I am feeling these remotes and they are literally both here. In fact they are in my lap right now.

Later we get pulled over, and my right jean pocket is full of bud. I’m super nervous. The trooper tells me to get out of the car for a pat down and I’m thinking this is it, I’m caught. He pats around my jacket and feels the hard bars and asks “what’s in your pocket here?” I say I don’t know, because at this point I had honestly forgotten about the soap. All I know is it’s not my right jean pocket so he can have whatever the fuck it is. “You don’t know??” He asks super suspiciously, thinking I’m playing dumb. So he plunges his hand straight into the pocket and pulls out a handful of little packages of bar soap. First he just stares at it, then just starts laughing his ass off. I tell him, “oh that’s right officer, we stole this from the hotel we were staying at. I’m sorry man” and I really play up the I’m sorry I stole soap thing.

13457,Stimulants,L-Theanine or magnesium glycinate to combat unwanted Adderall side-effects? (mini panic attack) Advice please &lt;3,"I've been on Adderall IR 10mg 2x a day for the last couple of months, I don't do it every day just on days I have a class (4 days a week), and I've never once had any undesirable side-effects, nor have I ever experienced any sort of anxiety while on it.

Long story short: I woke up yesterday (Friday morning) at 7am, took my normal dose before class, but I ended up staying up late last night studying and didn't fall asleep until 5 AM, and had to wake up this morning at 7:30 AM so I slept for ~2.5 hours last night, and after waking up I took my 10mg dose before heading out to school. Problem is, for the first time in my life on Adderall, I experienced what I felt was extreme tachycardia, and then I started to have a mini panic attack (feeling like a heart attack, starting to freak out, etc. I had panic attacks after Weed years ago before so I know what it feels like. Never after being on Adderall, though). It subsided after about 30 min after laying down and controlling my breathing, but it leads me to this question:

I'm a bit nervous now that I may have a similar episode while being at school next week. Would L-Theanine or magnesium glycinate prior to taking Adderall to help with potential anxiety? I've reading user reports on the internet/reddit, but I'm having difficulty finding any sort of research paper on the true interactions between either of the aforementioned and Adderall. I read that L-Theanine is in green tea, which makes me feel like its a stimulant... so shouldn't it technically RAISE my heart rate further, or am I mistaken? I just want to make sure I don't fuck up and take something with my Adderall thinking its going to ease potential anxiety, and it makes my heart race even more.

Also, I know this is probably a stupid question, but is it possible that I had this panic attack due to being pretty sleep deprived? I normally sleep pretty well, but last night/this morning obviously I didn't.

13483,Lisdexamphetamine,Questions regarding Vyvanse and other medications.,"As the title says, 
      Recently I a coworker of mine connected me to someone with a prescription for vyvanse. I bought a few from him and have been taking them every now and again, mostly like on a Saturday when I wanna get shit done. And it works! 
      When I was in 2nd grade. My teacher forced my dad to take me to get scene by someone because she claimed I had ADHD and couldn’t be controlled in a classroom environment. I don’t really remember 2nd grade but I do remember the meds, I’d take them M-F before school. On that stuff, it seemed like I was a zombie. I’d remain silent all the time, my dad noticed the most and hated seeing me not as my “true self”. After around Christmas that year, he got fed up with the meds and he trashed them because he hadn’t seen me so lively and happy in a while over that holiday. (I hadn’t been taking them since I wasn’t in school for the moment.)
      As an adult, I’ve been going through a tough time mentally in life right now. I’ve come to un-accept Christianity, along with that it’s been hard to really find good reasons for a “purpose in life”. Not at risk of suicide more, just unhappy with the idea of living in this life. (This is a different subject all it’s own) 
Finally to my question! 
      I think I want to get scene by someone and possibly get a real honest prescription for some medications. I’ve felt so “accepting” of life lately. I’ve had a drive to work harder and constantly keep active. Dietary wise, I’m loosing weight at a healthy rate since I haven’t had the desire to over eat. And I haven’t had as depressing thoughts about all the “what if’s” out there that put my mind in a depressed state. All this even outside or using the pill once or twice a week. 

Who can I go see for a vyvanse prescription/checkup ? (Doctor or council wise) 
What other options are out there that I can ask about when I do get scene, besides vyvanse? 
And any one have any real negative sides to taking stuff like this? Googles only so much help. 
Thanks! 

TLDR: just refer to my questions above to skip back story. ^

13490,Long Post,How i went from 'Bad Trip' to 'Breakthrough',"I'll pre-face this by saying i never had planned to take DMT last night, but i'm so glad i did.

The plan was, for me and 2 friends to get whacked on ket at friends A's house. Friend B had very little K left though so asked if i would bring my LSD, which i did and ended up taking 2 tabs myself when we arrived, which also wasnt part of my plan.

I should also mention that mid-journey to friend A's, friend B tells us he is bringing a friend of his own, which we was okay with so let the +1 join in.

Jump forward a few hours, the K is flowing and the LSD is kicking in nicely, the +1 is actually making me laugh so hard i couldn't breathe. 'This is a great trip' i thought. That changed pretty rapid very quickly.

The +1 had been up all day drinking and was a very easily confused person, as well as being inadvertently challenging to everything we said, mostly in confusion. This was funny for a while, but as the night went on, it started to get annoying, and then the mood changed when he started trying to engage a conversation with us and challenging everything we would respond to.

So it gets to around 9pm, and i'm really not feeling good, i had a friend picking me up at midnight anyways, so i sent friend A a message telling him i was starting to go into a bad trip and had to jet, he understood which was a relief.

So i get my ride to come early, im gone by 9:20pm. I'm in the car still feeling anxious and scared and a whole assortment of negative emotions, on the verge of tears, but i'm holding strong. 'I can save this, i just need to laugh and i'll be on the road to a good trip again.'

Well my ride came in clutch there by telling me a story of him accidentally clipping a car wing mirror, good trip here i come.

So i get back to my flats, as soon as i start walking through the complex i get a huge cheshire grin on my face and start practically sprinting to my flat, as soon as im through the door im almost certain im gonna have a great trip.

I still had some K, so i buzzed another friend to come round and help me polish it off. 20 mins later he arrives and my mood is already ecstatic. Near enough guaranteed good trip now.

Around 30 mins passes of us doing lines and shooting the shit, we pop to shops for some drinks and when we get back he almost immediately reminds me i have a small amount of DMT left.

Fuck it, i'm feeling good, lets have a blast off.

I weigh out what's left - 15mg. huh, thought there was more. oh well, at least i'll still have a blast on 15mg.

Load up the bowl, get some tunes ready and dim the lights.

1st hit; smooth, long, almost coughed but i held it down for a solid 10s  
2nd hit; smooth, no clue how long it lasted, mid way through my vision split and my mind was sucked into the gap that lead to another realm not conceivable to even attempt to imagine. Much of what i saw i actually forgot, i'm mostly attributing that to the K, but i have no doubt in my mind that i broke through, the parts are remember are so vivid yet so ineffable, but most of all so strikingly wonderful.

When i came back it was to the warm touch surrounding my body leaving, and my friend saying ""dude, there's nothing left put down the pipe""

This made me aware that i was still holding the pipe and lighter, the lighter had ran out of gas since through the whole trip i apparently held down the trigger, the lighter was red hot so i dropped that on a damp cloth along with the pipe, and my first thought was ""Holy shit... i just broke through""

Once the afterglow died off, we went back to polishing off the K, holed hard af and came down by 2am. 

TLDR; Almost had my first bad trip cause of a new person in the group, got an early pickup home, did some ket and DMT, broke through, went to bed

13698,Psychedelics,My First 1600 mic Trip (Cont.),"If you missed my first post you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/af53v0/my_first_1600_mic_trip/?st=JQTXKAU7&amp;sh=dbad7125).  I’m just gonna jump right in with no preamble so I highly recommend giving the first post at least a cursory glance.  

(Long read) I am sitting on the couch, tears are drying on my face and my soul has become pure light.  Coke pal smiles at me as he walks over from the bathroom.
“It’s been a long time since we’ve seen each other.”
From a sober perspective he was probably talking about the fact we’d been in our own little worlds for the past couple of hours but from my tripped out perspective coke pal was speaking with the voice of God.  I slowly looked at him and I felt elation, awe, a host of emotions that barely made sense to an atheist mortal experiencing God speaking directly to them.  I had never felt something so divine, so *correct* in all my life.  My immediate first thought was to fall prostrate and begin to worship coke pal.  

Before I could make a complete fool of myself God distracted me.  He said he had something for me to see.  God pal began shuffling YouTube videos.  One after the other, I can’t remember much but there was one where it was this young white guy (like me) doing a rap about his struggle with depression.  Every video meant more and more, reaching a paramount level and by the time coke pal finally stopped the videos I was silently weeping into my hands.  God pal  watched me quietly for a long while and then he began talking about our mutual friends, ones who had pulled me and coke pal out of some incredibly rough situations back then.  People I knew I could count on for anything.  I pictured each of their faces individually and there was a surge of brotherly love within my heart.  

This one is difficult to explain but I’m going to try.  At high doses I get this complex delusion going where I believe that the world is only made up of small sects of humanity full of archetypes.  Each sect is the same and carries the same archetypes.  Humanity moves forward through the effort and never ending repetition of these archetypes.  If you’re wondering what the archetypes are they’re Christian in nature.  Old men that represent a vindictive father, holy mothers, wise men, and most importantly (to me) the center of all the growth and death, the redeeming son. 

If you haven’t caught on I was slowly beginning to convince myself that I was Jesus Christ.  Although the archetype didn’t only belong to me, there were many others and we were all coalescing and learning, doing our best to create prosperity for the world.  God pal spoke a lot but I can’t remember much of what was said, we focused on our friends and I began to think of them as apostles whose sacrifice had led to me being able to be comfortable.  We both began crying thinking about their selflessness.  

As the delusion grew stronger I began to remember what role Jesus played in the bible, so naturally I realised it was my destiny to be crucified to save humanity.  God pal assured me I would be ready when the time came and that my fear and pain would be taken from me but I had trouble believing him and I was scared.  This weird thought pattern continued for quite a while and somewhere along this time I ran out of cigarettes (not previously mentioned but I had been chain smoking the entire time). 

I realised I didn’t have a cigarette just as the sun was rising.  I became obsessed with the idea of getting more and I whined to God pal to take us to a gas station to get more.  After a while God pal agreed and we stepped out into the sunlight.  It felt as if time resumed the moment we opened the door and I realised just how massive the world was.  As we drove down the road I began to get the idea that rapture was occurring.  To my extremely deluded mind it seemed like all the vehicles were going in the same direction (even the ones that weren’t).  We were headed to something so great and indescribable I found myself shaking with reverie as I tried to explain to coke pal (who was no longer God) that our pain and suffering was over for good.  

Coke pal tried to keep me in line on the way there but somehow I found out how to roll down my window and I found myself shouting at some old lady in the car next to us.  I told her to “hurry the fuck up, heaven is waiting!”  Luckily her window was up and I don’t think she heard me before coke pal dragged me back into the vehicle.  We arrived at the gas station and I was in full blown psychosis.  Since Armageddon was coming I wouldn’t need to pay for the cigarettes, the attendants would understand.  I hopped out of the car with no shoes on and I had the gas station door open before coke pal called out to me from the car, holding my wallet in his hands and telling me to trust him. 

I had my doubts but I took my wallet anyway.  Once inside I excitedly told the attendant I needed cigarettes, whatever kind he could give me.  Then I handed him my wallet.  I stood their grinning like an idiot with pupils the size of dinner plates while he dug around in my shit, checking my id and then using my debit card to pay for the ciggies.  I thanked him and walked back to the car.  I immediately lit up and the nicotine potentiated my trip.  

The psychosis hit an extreme point.  I began hearing my internal monologue in reverse.  Every time coke pal spoke I heard it forward and then in reverse.  It was as if the entire universe was expanding and then seizing on itself.  I was shaking trying to explain some stupid shit when a revelation hit me.  
“Coke pal, don’t freak out,” 
I started,
“But either I’m schizophrenic, or I’m Jesus Christ.”
Coke pal was laughing but I didn’t understand why, this was serious. 

I was babbling endlessly while holding a cigarette in one hand, dropping ash all over coke pals floorboard.  For whatever reason coke pal decided to drive around for a long time and talk about why he didn’t like acid.  He told me he had been a volunteer fire fighter and had responded to a wreck where a very important person to him had died.  Whenever he tripped hard he saw her.  I listened intently and I began to freak out when in front of me the road was closed, full of emergency vehicles.  It was road construction but in my mind state it was a sign.  We were going to experience his worst nightmare again and he would be shown that it wasn’t that bad, that God could take his pain and even reunite him with that loved one.  

I began trying to hint to him that he would see that person very soon but he kept telling me it wasn’t possible.  As this (humorous now) grim conversation continued we approached a hair pin turn.  I knew we were going to die when we went around that turn and I told him to stop, begged him to stop.  He slowed down but we went around the curve then he stopped on a little dirt patch by the road while I broke into the hardest sobs of my life.  

After I’d regained some composure I felt the trip dropping off heavily and I leaned back in my seat, closing my eyes.  In my mind I had a weird CEV where I popped out of this machine into a stark white world.  I was sobbing and there was a man in a white coat asking me how “they” (humanity) were doing.  Through my tears I said “so much better, compared to the last few iterations”.  After a brief conversation I agreed to reenter the machine and I opened my eyes.  Coke pal was driving and the world was quiet.  I sat up and we rode in silence until we arrived back at the apartment.  

Coke pal went to sleep but I had to go to work in a different city so I sat quietly in the dark apartment (black out curtains).  Within a few hours I was sober and tired.  I hopped in my car and drove away.  I had no idea what had happened to me and it was weird thinking from a baseline of normalcy.  The sun was high in the sky and I had so much to think about.  Thanks for reading.

So, today I didn't take any benzos, took a bit of speed (several small bumps over several hours, so nothing major). Went for a walk, and the symptoms (combined with psychological fear associated with taking amps again in the first place) contributed to me almost having a panic episode. Took 2mg's of Xanax, feeling better, and now I want another line. Well... rather, I'm willing to experiment a bit if it's worth it (I've heard some interesting, positive points on other message boards, for example).

It was weird and I just had this feeling and after about half an hour I started feeling nauseous and I threw up multiple times. My mind was racing and I had serious hallucinations. If I didn’t want to throw up I had to convince myself I was too good to throw up. Also my parents were two doors from my room. After 2 hours of hell I eventually remembered I had Ritalin under my bed. I snorted abt 80 mg of it and because it’s an upper it kind of counteracted the effects of the dab. It just felt like I was really stoned but I was also shaking uncontrollably and my heart rate was insanely high and I couldn’t sleep. I hit the dab at like 10:30 and it took until 11:00 for everything to wear off. I now have healthy respect for dab,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afdv6p/my_first_dab_experience/

I lived in Brazil, and i have moved for an exchange to Portugal, but things have been really shitty here, and i've ended up all of the time i've been here all alone, mostly working on my University stuff.   


I had some bad things happen to me in here, from not having money to buy food and living in a shitty house where there's no heating (temps get below 0 ºC here and the houses are pretty old, so it gets colder than i'd wish) to having some shitty housemates and some trauma i brought with me from my hometown. Anyway, i have been experiencing anxiety almost everytime i smoke bud (mostly we get sativa/sativa dominant weed around here) and some pretty bad paranoia. I mean, there were many times I thought i was dying because of some stomach aches i have been having, because they would never go away and would only be more present after i smoked. I always had some anxiety but it used to get better after i smoked weed, but right now it only gets worse and worse.   


I'll be coming back to my country in two days because i'm too tired of Portugal and everything that's happening around, and i'd be glad if you guys could share any experiences you had with anxiety and paranoia when smoking weed, and if you have any ways of overcoming it.

14122,Dissociatives,Ketamine somewhat cured that person talking in my head,"Around late December 2018, My friend and I decided to take 300ug of lsd, along with about around 4 grams of bud all packed into bowls.. Got us going goin pretty good. This was both our first time trying this dose, 200 was the most we have ever ever done, we both have a pretty good experience with other substances. This trip though we decided to spice it up with a around 100mg of ket.. 

All I can say is the two combined is truly something else. My trip was going so well, we had the basement to geek out and do whatever the fuck we want. Later on brought over some other friends who were not sober either, barred the fuck out.. this is what made my trip the most unenjoyable trip of my life. Im not sure if would call it a psychosis, a fattass panic attack, losing my mind (i was lost). 

In my past I have struggled with the voice that talks to you in your head. This voice gave me doubts that i actually wasn’t straight. “What if your gay?!?!?”   and it worried the shit out of me because i knew i was straight. I was sexually active in highschool. I had girlfriends (have one now that i love with all my heart) 
I found that all of this worrying and thinking was  a big tribute to to my childhood and my genetics. My father has OCD and ADHD which was i guess passed down to me. Been diagnosed with adhd not 100%. Idk if i really have bad OCD like cleaning stuff ect. But my brain is always fuckin with me in that sort of wat. My Father was also pretty vocally abusive it was pretty bad, one of his favorite lines if i did something that didnt look good or he didnt like. 
He would say “your fuckin gay!” “That looks fuckin gay” didnt affect me that young because my parent broke up when i was young.

After a 2 year old relationship with one girlfriend in highschool that ended really bad. i didnt get laid for around a half year and thats when  this whole annoying thought got stuck in my head, even when i was hooking up with girls for the rest of highschool. I dont think smoking all that weed helped i heard that it makes u a little paranoid about that shit (not all people get it)

Back to the drugs now, had to just throw that in there. Im sure some other people experience the same thing on ketamine, its super fuckin hard to under stand people when you start getting on the higher doses. My dose? I dont fucking i know.. i was stupid i just busted it all up and bumped it the whole time watching DEEP tripping absolute balls. The 2 friends i mentioned earlier who were barred out were literally make 0 sense. I could hear their words but it was just gibberish. “ the cat jumped out of the bed back into a can of pop where the can died.” Shit like that...

Near the end of the night Everythings still going great, good thoughts. I think about that stupid “what if im gay” bs (have nothing agains homosexual people btw) and my heart just stopped... i felt like everything in this whole world just came crashing down on me and me life was over. I was scaring my friends pretty bad.. i just got up and started looking at them thinking. what. Thefuck is going on. Am i going schizophrenic im thinking way to much and my brain is about to self destruct....

Usually you cant remember alot on acid and ket but this was dead stuck in the center of my head and i couldnt get it out. My friends started worrying for me. But in my high ass thought that they were trying to get me to admit that i was gay but they never actually used that word. 
I didnt trust them.. at all i didnt believe they were real. Why did I think that? I also had the thought was in a full on vivid dream, thinking to me myself that maybe i k holed? Idk but nope i was just trippin. My friends were clearly real standing infront of me trying to make me feel better. This a dream i kept telling them “i need to touch you to see if you are real”  

Was in a K hole and nobody else was?? Thats what i thought.. i had an image the whole time of them and the whole highschool watching over me... reading what i was thinking... soo that were trying to find out the answer. I heard voices .. but this voice was my grad date.. saying 
My name, giggling. This is totaly real i was teling myself. 

The only thing i was telling myself was “i dont want this i cant do this” i kept on looking at pictures of the girl who i love (we broke up for a month at that time) after that i realised the love that i had for that girl... 

Heading to bed now.... im calming down im still thinking about her. And then the same thing happens like earlier, my heart slightly stopped but this time it was a peaceful feeling. I found my self. I thought about my dad. My old girlfriends. And just how much i enjoy having sex. The last voice i heard in the back on my head was “your fine, your good you know who you are and have this whole time” i reflected on that anxiety so much in bed while still tripping balls, didnt know if my eyes were open or closed. But i was just so fuckin happy that i found myself. 

I will say though its popped up here and there and I can easily reflect on it quickly and toss it out...

Shortly after that trip^^ i went to a concert and saw my girlfriend when were both on mdma. Made my night ❤️and something just sparked. We have been going super strong since then.

Pretty long story, really changed my life though for the better. I wont be using ketamine again or atleast not that much lol

Thanks so much for letting me share this

14131,Stimulants,2 years of no sleep barely eating and intense adderall binges + physical anxiety attacks and hypochondria xposted in r/adderall,"tl;dr I’ve been abusing adderall for 2 years and in that time I never slept or ate and would drink. I’m concerned about my physical anxiety symptoms being real indictors something is wrong or is going to be wrong w my heart. And I’m a hypochondriac to begin with.

Long time lurker, but could never quite find my answer. I took adderall XR 30 as prescribed for like 3 years until my sophomore year of college when one of my best friends showed me a pill crusher and said “if you only want a little pick me up you crush some of the beads and snort/injest it” at the time, I didn’t realize adderall abuse or misuse was a thing that was bad, abnormal, or had any real consequences. Then the first time came when I ran out of prescription early and I was like wtf. So I was more careful but slowly grew an addiction to this point where I am a senior in college and dropping out before I graduate. Most people jokingly say I have a problem or that I love adderall, but I haven’t told a single person the extent of my use, taking as much as 90XR over 24 hours then doing that for a week straight and just in general off and on. It’s fucked up my sleep and eating for the last two years, not sleeping for 2-3 days on binges, going 3 days without having anything but water and maybe a protein shake and then drinking heavily. I’m much better now about sleep and eating and drinking because I’ve had the epiphany that you can’t treat your body like that and not have repercussions. This is where the anxiety/hypochondria come in. I’m constantly terrified and obsessed with the idea that my past and current adderall abuse is giving me/already has given me a heart problem or some other thing that means I’m gonna die soon. I have severe panic attacks and because no one knows the extent of how I abuse my body, everyone says it’s just anxiety when I have chest pain or the fact that my resting heart rate is 125. I’ve had severe nutrient deficiency, lack of sleep repeatedly and regular abuse of adderall and I’m scared it’s not “just anxiety” but I can’t express that to my parents without them knowing. The past two months I’ve done good about only taking prescribed (I don’t think I have addict gene, but who knows) but I still worry the severe panic attacks I have are indicators of other things, coupled w being a moderate smoker and not exercising and having a chronic cough and a variety of other symptoms. Basically looking for any reassurance from anyone who may have had a similar time in their life and are now healthy or at least living and not having heart problems? Everything online is either really biased from drug rehab centers or doesn’t really address anything I’m talking about. Basically I have anxiety 24/7 about my health and I’m trying to work through it but it’s hard when you’ve actually treated ur body terribly and ur health anxiety might be for good reason?

14192,Cannabis,Update to the weird weed delegation story the other night,"This is the OG story  copy and pasted here


I had the worst trip last night. Since marijuana is a memory loss drug. I will try to recount the night as best as I can. Keep in mind that it’s hard for me to describe things like this because I don’t have much to base it off.

For some background, I’m a seventeen year old kid who’s growing up in a religious Mormon household. Lately I’ve been seriously questioning the Mormon church and it’s teachings.

I finished smoking a bowl and decided to sit down and watch some YouTube. My favorite thing to watch while high is Vsauce so I turned on one of his videos about Deja Vu. I remember being excited because since I was high this video about Deja Vu was going to actually give me Deja Vu. Then my mind sort of went numb. I don’t remember much else other than all of a sudden for no reason whatsoever I was continuously being reminded that Deja Vu is a glitch in the matrix.

Then it hit. The only way I can describe what happened is if you turn up the bass super high in your car and listen to a song. It felt like a complete and total sensory overload throughout my entire body. I kind of liked it at first but then it kept happening and I had this powerful thought that this was indeed the matrix and nothing was real. This is when it started to scare me. I had that same feeling over and over again. I knew that I was starting to have a bad trip so I changed the video and decided to watch something else to get my mind off of Deja Vu and the afterlife.

It only got worse from there. I got really scared and wanted nothing more than to come down. I knew I wasn’t in my right mind and that this would all pass with time. This proved to be comforting throughout the night. Since I wanted to sober up a little I got up and drank a bunch of water. The water only helped so much, I would forget about my sudden realization that everything was fake and I’d start to calm down. Then I’d remember why I needed to calm myself down and it hurtled me back into knowing that everything around me was fake and I was most definitely in the matrix.

At this point, my heart rate was super fast and I was absolutely terrified. I decided to just go to bed because I knew somehow that this would all be gone in the morning. I laid down and told myself to go to sleep.

Throughout the next thirty or so minutes I would sit up and tell myself that everything was real and that you just kind of scared yourself. I kept telling myself over and over again that this was reality and that I had nothing to be scared about. Then it got worse. I got cold and really scared. I wanted to go tell my mom and dad what I did so that they could comfort me. I wanted to go lay down with my siblings and fall asleep snuggling with them. I just needed someone to help me. I felt splinched in between two realities. I had the desire to go throughout the entire world to make sure it was all still there. I kept repeating to myself in an almost trance-like way that I needed to stay in my room.

“Stay in your room TickNut, TickNut, stay in your room. You know this is okay TickNut. You know this is real and you know you need to stay in your room. It’s okay TickNut.”

I remembered that I could change this and I could come off of a bad trip if I changed my setting. So I went down to the kitchen to get me some food. I wasn’t in the mood to eat but I remembered that eating is a common thing when you’re high and it might help the derealization that I was having.

Something about having to be quiet and not waking everyone up helped bring me back to reality. As I was making corn dogs my little sister woke up and asked me what I was doing. I told her to come watch some tv with me because I needed the company. I showed her my Minecraft world and we watched some videos and I started to come down and I started to feel safe and okay again. I thought I’d beat the bad trip and I was going to be fine.

After a while, my sister decided to go to bed and I was left alone again. I laid down and tried to fall asleep. I started to come off the high and I told myself that I took something weird and I’d be okay in the morning. That’s when it got worse, so so much worse. I jolted up and I had finally come to the realization that I had indeed died. It made so much sense now, the weed I took was laced and I overdosed on something weird. I died and this was the afterlife. I was so completely and utterly terrified. I got up to look for my body. I believed that I had died and that I was a spirit disconnected from my body. I got up and looked throughout my house to find my body but I couldn’t ever find it. I went to lay down again and all of a sudden the realization changed slightly. I still overdosed and died, that part was all the same. But instead of being in the spirit world or afterlife I had just been transported to a parallel universe. A world almost infinitely similar to the original universe. But with one thing changed. TickNut never died in this universe. So here I was, alive but also dead. I started to think about all my loved ones I left behind, I thought the afterlife would be different. I thought I’d be able to see my funeral and spectate what happens to my body. But of course, this wasn’t the case. I’d never be able to see my old universe again. I had died in that one and could never go back. I kept telling myself that either I was just really high and having a bad trip or I had actually died and been sent to a parallel universe where everything felt very slightly different. I told myself to go to bed and when I woke up one of these things would be true and it was okay if I had died because I was in a universe that was basically the same already. I made peace with death and the unknown that night.

I woke up again and the high was gone, that awful terrible feeling was gone. I could only remember it vaguely. It had lasted all but two hours but it felt like an eternity. The bad trip did teach me some things though. If it was a bad trio after all.

Edit: Figured I’d better add a TL;DR

I smoked a bowl of marijuana last night and had this super intense derealization feeling that I had died and was experiencing the afterlife. I believed that I had overdosed and then was sent to an alternate universe where I could continue on living. I think it was a bad trip but I’m sort of worried I got something in there other than weed and I actually did die.

14281,Opioids,I want to feel normal again,"   *THIS IS MY FIRST SUPER LONG POST SO IT MIGHT BE SHIT, SORRY IF IT IS* 

   These are just my current experiences and thoughts of abusing loads of opioids for only the past two weeks. Started with finding a ton of Codeine, Hydrocodone, and Tramadol. The first one I tried was Hydrocodone which gave me a high so fucking heavenly I was basically hooked instantly, thing was I didn’t think I was really “addicted” not until recently atleast. 

   After having found out about how amazing these were I used all the hydros in only a few days then moved on to the Codeine and Tramadol. I’d take Codeine just in the middle of the day and love the high. Yet, the Tramadol is what I had so much of that that it ultimately became what I abused the most. I’d start the day off with 5 of them and then when they wore off in the middle of the day I’d take 5 more. I did this for 2 weeks straight every single day. Me being only 110 pounds I got a really damn good high out of them. It’s a feeling of ultimate relaxation and so much nice warmth and it would last for hours. I’d fall asleep in layers of blankets all day and when I was up I’d just lay in bed and enjoy watching videos , even driving with the heater on (especially in my states super cold weather) was absolute euphoria.

   I use a lot of drugs, weed being a big one and I’ve been interested in almost everything, I recently got my hands on 2 ecstacy and even some Adderall. I planned taking them two days ago and I knew the deadly interaction with those and Tramadol so I obviously didn’t take any Trams that day. I took the adderall which was pretty low dose but I definitely felt the focus and concentration in class, later on me and my friend took half a Tesla ecstacy each and saw a movie. We found out after an hour that we got hoed and the ecstacy didn’t do jack shit.

   Driving him back to his place I then experienced a terrible sense of anxiety and dread that was purely in my head and it was this feeling of worry about nothing but it would not leave me. I dropped him off home and experienced it multiple times throughout the night I could not sleep and the discomfort from the attacks were so bad that a few times I just yelled for it to fucking stop out loud.

   I eventually got some sleep and woke up feeling a bit better today. Still I feel I have zero appetite and zero appreciation or happiness out of anything. Not even getting in bed feels good I just feel cold and restless, I feel this right now as I type this. I feel generally anxious, depressed, and sick. I already determined as soon as I felt the attack yesterday that it was Tramadol withdrawal which I read can occur only 12 hours after the last dose. 

   Because of this pain I’ve decided to quit Trams and stick to weed I have no motivation to go out and do anything, I was even supposed to fuck some bitch tomorrow but cancelled cause of how awful I feel. I know the only thing I could do is wait and go through this until it ends. The heavy doses I took with such a small body got me hooked fast on them and this withdrawal has no fucking mercy. 

   Now if you have read this far then you came to the main reason I typed all this out and that is that I just want to know from any of you guys who’s experienced this situation to tell me what it is that I need to do and an estimate on how long this will last. Thank you if you actually got all the way down here. I need help basically.

  TL,DR: Got hooked on Trams and now decided to quit, withdrawal is awful and I want to know from personal experiences from you guys on what to do and how long it will take for me to just feel happy and normal again.

I’m pretty experienced with drugs generally and research everything thoroughly before doing them. Having done 2cb and 4acodmt plenty of times too. I’ve watched every video on acid, how to prepare for it and do it safely. I’ve held off on opportunities to do it many times because I’ve wanted my mind to be completely at ease and clear to fully make the most out of the trip. Acid has been one I’ve looked forward to the most and I’m so excited to explore my mind with it.

First time dosages seem to be between 100ug-150ug, the tabs I’ve gotten are 280ug (and yes I’ve tested them!). 

I think I’d be comfortable with the 280 but what are your thoughts? Stick with 280 or half it?

My gf will be trip sitting me and she’s tripped before so I trust her. I also have some Xans and Valium in case of anxiety but also thoughts on those? Do they really help during a trip if things start going downhill?

14491,Methamphetamine,Which drug is worse a crack addiction or meth addiction?,"Most of us have seen either tweakers or crackheads. Usually with most of them being very thin, bad teeth, and easier to obtain those drugs in bad areas well not always. The dopehouse/hotel that I go to, is always filled with them and it's hard to not notice them freaking out sometimes and getting extremely angry (Also from probably lack of sleep and eating). However the sad heroin addicts, seem to usually look and behave a lot more normal, so many times I can't tell when someone is addicted to heroin. Except if their nodding out/real sleepy, or have deep scars and absecess. Either way, i've done all those drugs a lot, and I would rather take heroin addiction over the craziness that I experience personally from using too much crack or meth. I don't feel confident being awake for more than 2 days (usually 4-5), and honestly the anxiety and paranoia drives me insane even with sleep. Plus I get real angry, which I hate because that's not what I want to be like. The voices and hallucinations also get a little too intense, but most of the girlz I hang with their are prostitutes and mostly addicted to crack or meth. (well and heroin but i'm not talking about those ones). Some of them have literally pieces of skin missing from their face or other body parts because they stick sharp objects because they feel bugs in their skin. Some of them don't but they try really hard not to, and most of them start getting in fights and aggressive after being awake for a few days. Sometimes they black out and wake up in different places without remembering falling asleep from being up so long. Some of them can read my mind, and do some weird stuff when awake for so long, but they also stuff flying around in the sky constantly, and people who aren't their. However despite the highs and durations, sometimes I find a lot of them act real similar and have same side effects that are either addicted to crack or meth. Honestly, I already mentioned how I feel about doing meth, and as far as if I was do too much crack, OOOO I wanna scream when I finish like half a gram or do anything for more (same with meth, but more fiendish with crack like crazy). And then comes the super intense depression like meth, but doesn't last as long well I never use it for more than a few days. And then intense irritablity. I get feel so pissed off sometimes coming down off crack that I just get surprised, because it can happen from using just half a gram and no lack of sleep. unlike with meth which I feel bitchy when I fried my dopamine and can't feel the high anymore and the demonic satanic side effects kick in. I would imagine meth is worse long term, only because i've had a few friends tell me that they were addicted to it for a few years, and they still have permanent side effects even after 5 years of quitting. Also regardless of how pure or unpure meth is, it is more toxic chemicallyy than most crack is. Oh I forgot to mention, crack can be a little forgiving when the quality is real good but like I said the girls I know smoke upto 300 a day so idk. Ones addicted to both, are always trying to steal things when prostituting with clients and are very good at manipulating/lying for even just a hit. Ehhh..... what would you say is worse to be addicted to, and what side effects comes along would you say, thanks. Too many uppers, have made me realize i'm a downer kind of person especially recreationally since theirs little to no side effects. But I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be even addicted to crack or meth for even 2 weeks, with those amounts some people do, I would freak out and die within the first week and end up in the mental hospital. I don't know how some of them can manage to behave and function pretty well when hearing voices and seeing all sorts of shit.

I don't know, maybe it's the ease of it. Maybe its the high, or just the mentality, but I find weed my most crippling drug. If I have it, I'm going to want to light up. Not only that, the entire weed culture has this ""smoke weed every day"" mentality that if it were applied to any other drug would be ridiculous. 

Maybe ""Smoke Crack Every Day"" doesn't have the same ring, but there is nothing healthy or sane about being baked every day.

If there's something I've learned throughout my drug-ventures is that you should appreciate sobriety, learn moderation and love life entirely, not only when you're high. 
Addictive in nature, not physicality. Just my two cents.

EDIT: A lot of the criticisms of my post is that people can take breaks easily, my point is that when we have weed we tend to get high every day, no days off, and that if that were applied to most other drugs you would be condemned as an addict. There's a mentality cultivated around weed that being high every day is an okay thing. I am not Anti-Weed, I think in moderation it is a low risk and well enjoyable drug.

**day 1 evening** a drug pal showed up at my house and i had just got some DMT, was gonna be our first time together, right? like we had planned?? nope

so i go first on a shitty meth pipe i could find. now the mf pulls out his phone and I'm thinking, sshit he's just texting right. whilst i was fucking blasted this dude was filming and eventually didn't do the dmt.

it's fine, we cool. I'm on the comedown and think, but yo i also got some etizolam for the first time it's probably a good idea to take some to just chill a bit.

so i had idk 500mg and got this fucked up scale and thought i weighed 3 mg. was probably closer to around 10 lmao. so yeah, 20 mins later I'm completely out.

dude leaves cuz we would go to a party later. ofc i dont remember agreeing to that, but he expected me there.

now its like **9 pm day 1** and im out. i get up at around 2am, send some texts. close my eyes a sec, its 5 am. so time for more etiz i guess, was just eyeballing it all at this point.


**noon day 2**
i get up start trying to remember what happened and spent the morning just moving shit back to place, cuz idk if you guys do that but like random shit in random places allll the time wtf, that's beside the point tho. decided to look for the rest of the dmt cuz there was at least 1 good hit left. yo fuck yeah les go bois. looking for the dmt i thought the etiz would jog my memory, obviously. so another hit

**9pm day 2**
still looking for dmt. searched entire house. under every furniture. so some
more etiz, christ why

now comes the fuzziest shit ever


**day 3 9am**
wake up to a shit ton of msgs asking if i was alright and wtf did i do to the house?? IDK MAN, wtf did i do?

there was blood everywhere. stove was on for no reason. chairs in random places. roommates avoided the fire thank God but i got up and fixed the mess asap. so WTF? im full of bruises and cuts all over. fuck me man

bruh it's still not over wtf

so roommates stayed at friends house cuz they thought i was on crack or something lmaao, and im trying to get my shit together and remember shit. by taking more etiz, duh


**6pm day 3**
a friend calls. lets call her Jane. so jane doesn't know anything  that happened, but she knows i had good shit. wants to hangout at my house... dude, yess

so since i couldn't fine the dmt anywhere she has ventured into benzos and decided to try some etiz with me. we eyeballed always cuz we dumbfuks

then all i remember is flashes of us kinda fucking up the house and  just woke up **noon day4**


**day4** was a complete haze but was getting through by just taking maybe 2-3mg of xanax throughout the day lel

only started feeling better the next morning. thank god

dont get into benzos, bros

15129,Long Post,Ego Death LSD Trip,"So it was September 4th, 2018. I had just arrived at college 3 days ago, and everyone was still settling in. I had met my two roommates, Eric and Joe, who seemed cool and had similar interests and we somehow all knew that we would become great friends.

Anyway, that night all of us had gotten drunk (I had probably around 7 drinks worth at 150lb), and we actually got into a few frats that I don’t really remember, other than crowd surfing at theta chi, getting lost, and walking back to my dorm alone. It was a 20 minute walk, but I was drunk and probably high too, so I don’t think I cared. I was in full send mode for the beginning of college. 

Then, eventually Joe and Eric returned to the room with some others, then everyone left except Joe, Eric, me, and this girl on our floor named Barbara. At this point, we decided to drop acid. I had 5 hits of some potent LSD I had got from my home state, along with some shrooms we had eaten a few days prior, that I had thrown up on and didn’t have an experience with, but Eric did. 

Moving on, me and Eric dropped 2 tabs of this acid and Joe dropped just 1 because he hadn’t done acid before. Before this, me and Eric had been obsessing over psychedelics, in that I’ve done acid 3 times previously, and Eric had done it 25 times previously, but Joe had never done anything other than smoke and drink. By the way, we all smoked weed at some point, I believe a lot, and I know that dab pens were involved, but I only smoked during the come up.

So, me and Eric were under the effects of about 300ug, and Joe was around 150. As we were coming up  we decided to go out for a walk. We had a fun walk, although I distinctly remember a lot of visuals at this point, and was probably acting pretty crazy even though I was still functioning and happy. When we got back to the room, I remember saying “this feels like heroin” and Joe and Eric both agreed with me, and then the girl asked me if I had ever done heroin, disgusted. I told her no, which is truthful, but later I realized that we were essentially turning into donkeys like that one scene in Pinocchio. The serotonin surge felt during the come up on LSD and parts of the peak can definitely at times, (especially when combined with other substances like mdma) can give the user an unprecedented amount of euphoria, that me and my friends describe as “unholy.” We really mean that it feels like more pleasure than a human could possibly handle or realistically feel without these magic substances.

The remainder of the trip happened in our dorm room. The girl was drunk and not high on LSD, so she passed out and had little effect on us the rest of the night, other than the fact that she was sleeping in Eric’s bed, which none of us were very happy about. Anyway, for some reason, me being a stoner who thinks of weed like “Minecraft diamonds,” I took a blinker from a dab pen that was probably fully charged. I take blinkers on the regular, but at the time I had only been smoking for about 2 weeks and my tolerance was quite low. Right after the rip, I threw up into my trash can and said something along the lines of “holy shit, I just took a massive rip; I’m going to get fucked” and then Joe and Eric probably laughed.

After this all of us started peaking, and I was tripping harder than I had ever tripped before, as LSD was the dominant force of all the stuff I was fucked up on. The last positive memory I have from this trip is when I was in my bed, probably tripping super hard when Joe and Eric came up to me and told me I should go fuck the girl sleeping in Eric’s bed. Obviously as college men do, we talked about girls a lot, and I was the only virgin of the three. They said something like “come on, you’ve never had sex, and now you’ve got a great opportunity while you’re high on LSD — your favorite drug!” Joe and Eric were highly enjoying themselves. I’m pretty sure I told them to fuck off because the girl was drunk, asleep, and by no means attractive. I found out later she even does a lot of cocaine, so fuck her for thinking I do heroin! Eric tried to get with her earlier but ended up pushing her away.

Alright, so this is where things start getting bad. It’s probably around 2 AM at this point, and we’re all peaking. I think I was probably able to hold myself together up until that point because of our walk we went on. Being in a changing environment can be surprisingly good on psychedelics. Anyway, I just tripped harder and harder, and had no idea when it was going to slow down. I had done 300ug before, but never more than that and I guess I was just totally unprepared for the power that LSD, weed, and alcohol could have when combined. 

At this point I believe that I turned down an offer for weed, and was in disbelief that Joe and Eric would want to smoke at all if they were tripping as hard as I was.

I just sat in my part of the room, with music going, and I got completely lost in my own head. I just acted cool at first like I had every other acid trip, and just let everything happen. After this trip, I unfortunately was never “cool” again on acid, although that may change one day. After that I started going into the classic LSD time loops, which horrified me. Many people have strong wills where they can easily let go of control on most drugs, but I respect anyone that can let go while their ego is being dragged out, kicking and screaming. I realized my sense of time was completely fucked and I’ve never had a psychedelic experience since then where my sense of time was just so messed up. I said out loud “I think I’m having a bad trip” when the visuals started to get purple, and scarier looking. Joe and Eric tried to say some things to calm me down, but honestly they were just enjoying their trips, and I won’t blame them for that. I’m not sure if they could have done anything anyway. I love them both greatly to this day.

After “I think I’m having a bad trip” I foolishly just lost myself again in my own thoughts, and went into more time loops, not even realizing that grounding myself would probably have gotten rid of the them. Then, I stood up and said “I’m shook to my very core.” At this point, I was getting extremely reverberated auditory hallucinations and that sentence probably resonated with me and really sent me on a hell of a bad trip. I was in another dimension, practically blinded by visuals. 

Then, I had an ego death just lying in my bed, and I told Joe and Eric, somehow. After probably 20-30 more minutes of time loops, I stood up and said “where am I,” followed by “who am I.” I obviously had the negative kind of ego death, where I had no idea what was or wasn't real, and there was a massive emptiness inside of me that I somehow knew it was where my ego used to go. I felt like I had been reduced to the 7 year old version of myself, having something to do with my true nature as a human being or perhaps the state of being or pure awareness people describe in other ego death experiences. It was the most horrible experience of my life by far. I was probably at least 9 times as fucked up as I had ever been in my entire life, and I told Eric that I just wanted to go home. All bets were off. It was no longer just fun and games. Before ego death, I’m pretty sure part of my brain was screaming at me, and convinced me I was going to die. It was like being completely consumed by anxiety to the point of literal death. I would imagine most other, weaker willed people would have called 911 by now, but not me. Somehow, I still knew that I was on a drug, and that the experience would end after a long time, and I just have to ride it out. 

I called my best friend from home, who I had woken up, and told him I was having a life threatening bad trip. Unfortunately he didn't really do anything to help other than just be there for me to talk to.

Somehow, I was able to solve a Rubik’s cube at some point during my peak, which I practice all the time sober, and I said right after: “I’m not going to remember this.” I think it’s because I realized I was in just such a higher state of consciousness. Joke’s on him though, because I remember just that very moment, and not much else.

I was crying and begging Eric for xanax, and begging the acid Gods to make it stop, as I knew it would kill my trip. I met some plug at a frat the day before, but didn't have any connection. It was hopeless.

At this point I totally understood why people have been known to commit suicide on acid. I felt like I was lost in a dark forest, or like a labyrinth in my brain. I could literally see it. I thought I had broke my head and I had to accept the fact that I was going to be insane forever. That coupled with visuals of clowns made me feel like life is just some sick joke that is being played on us. A real “Alice in Wonderland” kind of drug, LSD is, and I fell way too far down the rabbit hole, although some psychonauts say that the right dose is where you think you've taken too much.

I don’t remember too much more, other than taking melatonin hoping I would fall asleep, then trying to go to sleep, and then realizing that I’m in an inescapable nightmare. The peak lasted for around 8 hours, and I wasn't really sober for around 30 hours.

Joe and Eric eventually went to go smoke a blunt outside and I literally had to call them and tell them to come back, because I was too scared. I was playing this dark song called “I the Witchfinder,” foolishly. I ended up throwing up around 6AM and the next few days I felt absolutely destroyed; traumatized, even. The trip was absurdly mentally challenging and I didn't even know what mental effects were before hand. So many people underestimate the mental danger of psychedelics.

It’s been over 4 months now, and I’m still integrating, and I still feel pretty messed up. I think about this trip every day. It made me feel like reality is a carpet that can be ripped away at any moment. Sometimes I think I’m still tripping and I’m going to be sent back to September 4th and my life since then has just been a big time loop. At this point, I have immense respect for acid, as it showed me that I clearly didn't have my life together in this life defining trip. I’m still just trying to find out what exactly happened that night.

15170,Cannabis,"Promethazine (Phenergan), and Vistaril (Hydroxyzine), and Bendaryl (Diphenhydramine), and some Good Weed","So first I’ve been trying to drink less. Second, these drugs listed are either prescribed to me, over the counter, or weed. 

I’ve only taken Promethazine a few times. Prescribed for constant nausea.  First two or three times I used it I used the maximum dose prescribed (only 25mg) and then compulsively resided up to 150mg. Then was very relaxed and sedated, but then came hours and twitching that kept me from sleep. Was sooooo tired but couldn’t sleep as the twitches kept me awake. 

Anyways. Last night I figured since I’d been off drinking two days, I’d try a little bit more of everything to see if I can get high. I used 100 mg Promethazine over 12 hours, 300-400 mg Vistaril over 24 hours, 40 or 60 mg Omeprazole over last 24 hours, a gram or two of good weed. 

Not worried at all really. Should I be? Interested in posting this now while fucked up. Curious if I’m going to get a bunch of responses saying I’m fucked and addicted and need to fix my life or if I get a bunch of comments saying have a great night sounds like a good time.

They really hit hard, tho. But I just think it's odd that the amount of mdma keeps getting higher every time a new kind of Ecs-tablets arrives finland, yet the price stays the same. Also, people are selling ~80% pure mdma crystals for ~100€ / 1g, if those DK-Tablets really contain ~250mg, why would anyone buy the expensive crystal when you can get the same amount of mdma AND propably some other mdma like substances that are mixed into the tablets. As DK-Tablet costs 20€/1 (~250mg?) It would be 20€ cheaper to buy 4 DK-Tablets + You'd probably get an improved high because as I said they might be mixed with some mdma like substances!

15309,Methylphenidate,Best Focalin/Ritalin Extraction,"Here is my best attempt at focalin (dexmethylphenidate) /ritalin (methylphenidate) extraction.

**You will need:**

* 90%+ Isopropyl Alcohol
* Oral Syringe (20mL+works best)
* Your pills
* Coffe Grinder
* Cotton
* 2 vials (one vial can be substituted for crystallization disk)

**Step One:** Grind pills in coffee grinder till they are powder

**Step Two:** Pour powder into vial, and pour excess of isopropyl alcohol (at least enough alcohol to completely submerge powder + 50% extra on top of powder)

**Step Three:** Leave powder submerged under iso for one hour, mixing powder every 10 minutes

**Step Four:** Using syringe, take cotton and shove it down into the tip of the syringe creating a filter

**Step Five**: Place syringe into iso/powder solution and extract the isopropyl alcohol and place onto crystallization disk

**Step Six:** Repeat steps Two through Five one more time (the more times the better)

**Step Seven:** Once all the iso used is now on crystallization disk, wait for the iso to evaporate (the longer it takes to evaporate, theoretically the bigger the crystals will be. However I've never been able to get huge crystals)

**Step Eight:** Scrape powder off disk and store in airtight container. When ready to use, weigh out dose and enjoy

# IMPORTANT: IF EXTRACTING WITH INTENT TO INJECT, A MICRON WHEEL FILTER IS 150% NECESSARY. A SIMPLE COTTON FILTER WILL NOT GET OUT ALL THE FILLER NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO SAFELY INJECT.

note: weigh powder of crushed pills before and after extraction to see how much you extracted to get a rough estimate at purity.

At the time there was so much going on in my head I was mentally unable to write a trip report. I did not have the words for what I saw

I had previously had like 30 separate high dose 5 tabs or 7gs mushroom and acid trips not finding what I was looking for until I tried this hippy flip.
 I felt like I was limitless, everything I felt was negative about myself was absent, especially my social awkwardness, somehow I’m always very awkward and could never find anything to say in a conversation, sober and tripping, but DURING THIS TRIP I was talking up my friends so much, normal conversations too, I always had something interesting to say and even tho I was tripping balls, I wasn’t saying stupid shit. 
I felt like everything I’ve done wrong in the past was undone.
Everything was perfect, I was having the time of my life

Also the visuals were fucking insane

8-14 hours in the trip tho is when things got bad, first time I’ve ever had a bad time. 
I felt so extremely motivated to change my life, I made a life plan, tried to figure out what I was going to do and I wanted to take a Action right then.
But I was so motivated but still so fucked up I couldn’t do ANYTHING, I tried getting up but my legs were completely jello and I kept falling over,  it was scary and sad.

15390,In memoriam,Selling drugs was the perfect career for me. I wish I could get a degree in it.,"Hi all,

I am about to begin my second semester of masters school for a degree in music performance. I am also a teaching assistant. This winter break I have not touched my instrument once, except for gigs and teaching private students. I haven't wanted to. Not even the impending beat down from my professor is enough to motivate me to practice.

I haven't enjoyed practicing since about sophomore year of highschool, yet I made myself (sorta). I've never been phenomenal, but I've done well enough to win competitions and festivals. I've toured 3 countries with various groups and made decent money. I am not in any debt at all, as between music scholarships and assistantships, both my undergrad and graduate school have paid me to go to school. This was essential, as my only parent is my single mom whom is on disability. This is also how I afforded my instruments, in addition to my other jobs.

I have no nest eggs and under a grand in savings, but I am debt free and only 23. I have maintained a 4.0 my entire college career (and most of highschool) and am in good standing with the music community. It isn't too late to start again! My therapist has helped me realize how unhappy I am with my current path. Again, I am good, but not good enough to make a career out of it and not motivated enough to do anything about that. The dichotomy is difficult for me and causing me to hate my life. Most of this winter break I have spent on my ass watching youtube about math and science, dreading my return to school.

Now I know I'm going to lose some of you here, but I implore you to keep reading. I don't know how I can't mention this as I think it pertains to my future. The only non-social/romantic relationship that I have felt passionate about in the last 7 years or so was something I cannot go back to.

I used to be a drug dealer, then distributor, then smuggler in a gang in my undergrad. It was originally to help pay for my instruments, but quickly I fell in love with the lifestyle and the money, and the ""free"" drugs were a nice perk. I mostly sold psychedelics and weed, with a brief stint pushing coke. I haven't done anything other than weed since late 2016, and even then, I only did that 19 times in 2017. I quit selling because my girlfriend's parents asked me to (which is ironic because their daughter was my best customer before we dated) but I tell everyone it was because of my best friend's overdose, which happened around that same time. In reality, I didn't really care about my friend's death as I had tried to get him help multiple times and had already accepted his fate. I would still be selling currently if I didn't give my word to elders whom I respect.

I loved everything about dealing drugs. I could practice my instrument and wait for people to come pick up. I could go for a bike ride (one of my greatest passions) with a pack on my back and turn 1750 into 2100 bucks in about an hour, plus the perk of getting to see old friends and help them make money. Driving over state borders and smiling at the state police and their German Shepherds, knowing that the vacuum sealed packs under your back seat give off 0 scent. Everything about it was thrilling and exciting, kept my heart pumping and my adrenaline going. Everyone was happy to see you. Tough motherfuckers respected you. You got free drinks, free drugs, and lots of love everywhere you went. I lifted and ran, knowing I might have to use my body to get away one day. When I'd throw a party, the place would be packed with people enjoying themselves and earnestly wanting to be with you. I promise you I'm not making this up: Even typing this now brings a huge smile to my face and legitimately makes my eyes mist up and my heart heavy missing that life. Right before I had quit, I was meeting with people who had wives and children. We wore button ups and polos and shook hands. These were people who never even touched the product, just housed the vacuum sealed bags. These were professionals who paid mortgages doing this! I was finally getting out of my shit neighborhood and background. I could finally afford vacations and nice clothes. I could take people on nice dates and buy them presents. I didn't have to stress about every dollar, and could be generous. Sure, dealing with sketchy people sucked sometimes, and having a barrel of a gun in my face over just a couple zips made me feel like shit, but honestly it made me tougher and to this day, very little scares me thanks to that. I could be the person I wanted to be.

I would spend hours researching different chemicals, their interactions, the chemistry behind them, the legality of certain substances... You name it, I knew it. Erowid was my homepage. I felt like AP chemistry finally had use in my life. Since winter break has started, I have old friends calling me asking about the best ways to store lsd, how best to saturate the substrate in their mushroom grow, and even how best to defat Mimosa hostilis root bark. Not only did I answer these questions easily off the top of my head, but I spent hours re-researching the topics, digging up old guides I made, old teks I revised and edited, and it dawned on me. This passion, this love of research, this drive within me to find out more and learn and grow... **This is how I'm supposed to feel about my major**

I made money doing something I loved. It combined my business cunning, my social skills, my drive to succeed and grow, and it was in a field I was deeply passionate about and earnestly wanted to learn more about. I got to use my knowledge of science and math on the daily, all while making good money, little time investment, and maintaining a 4.0 my entire undergrad. I had high social status and people wanted me at their events. It kept my heartbeat up and inspired me to exercise. It kept me on edge, sharp, and tough. It was absolutely perfect for me.

So here I am. I don't love studying music really anymore. I miss dealing drugs dearly. I am not an idiot anymore and would like to pursue an actual profession that I could get a degree for. Is there anything close to that in the professional world? My only other interests are hard sciences and pure math, which I greatly enjoy studying every lunch break and before I go to bed. Proof youtube videos and engineering guides have been nearly my entire entertainment while I'm wasting away on my couch this winter break! I know I would hate life as an engineer, as the boredom and lack of thrill would eat me alive. When was the last time an engineer's young hot customer wanted to get with them! I am cripplingly afraid that I won't find anything I'm truly passionate in. I feel like no matter what I pursue, I'll just end up how I am with music currently, tired and bored and not willing to put in the work.

I've never felt another passion like I had for dealing. I struggle with motivation and self discipline in every other aspect of my life, but I never put off dealing. I was always eager to chase down the next sale, contact, or job. It gave me self-worth and dignity, which I've been missing especially lately. Hell, it even made me practice better, burning time till my next meetup.

I hope you guys might be able to help me. I just want to feel excited and passionate about something that makes me money and challenges me again. I miss loving my job and my life so much. I really hope you guys might have an idea!",70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afoi8j/selling_drugs_was_the_perfect_career_for_me_i/

15460,Not butane you fucks,Stop spreading misinformation on Nitrous Oxide,"Nitrous Oxide is a gas. It is 2 nitrogen atoms bonded with 1 oxygen atom; hence why it is often called n2o. Nitrous Oxide is colloquially known to the common public as laughing gas. That gaseous anesthetic that dentists get off on putting you under with. It is also known as NOS or whippets. Nitrous Oxide is a dissociative anesthetic. Its effects are similar to drugs like Ketamine, DXM, MXE, and other dissociatives. So its quite enjoyable.

&amp;#x200B;

Nitrous Oxide is important because it can be used as a short acting (1-5 minute duration) anesthetic with virtually NO risk. This is because it doesn't cause brain damage. I am repeatedly seeing you good ol' druggie buds say shit like ""Nitrous is bad"" or ""Nitrous causes brain damage"". It does not for shit cause brain damage. This myth comes from god knows where maybe D.A.R.E. saying inhalants cause brain damage (which in general they do). Nitrous Oxide among other are exempt. They DO NOT CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting tired of misinformation being spread about Nitrous Oxide. Those of us who do research before we take drugs instead of believing our ""Bestie buddie Tom"" or whatever are aware that Nitrous Oxide doesn't cause brain damage. That being said it isn't without risk. The issue with Nitrous Oxide is mainly 2 things. 1). People inhaling the expanding gas directly from the cracker or dispenser. Expanding gas is very cold initially and can freeze water quickly. This means it can cause frost bite and damage to the nose, mouth, throat, and lungs when it is inhaled directly after being released. So put it into a balloon before you inhale that *Icy Fun Air***™** 2). Nitrous Oxide isn't oxygen (wowza). This means breathing it won't give your brain oxygen and if you're holding it or constantly hitting balloons without taking normal (oxygen containing) air breaths you won't be getting oxygen; therefore you can get brain damage. Don't just breathe Nitrous Oxide, get some air between balloons. Also don't hold your Nitrous Oxide, it only does harm and doesn't really get you higher.

Your body tells you when to inhale when it senses a level of carbon dioxide above a level not optimal for oxygen/carbon dioxide gas exchange in the lungs. When it senses too much carbon dioxide it makes you feel uncomfortable until you get some oxygen. Because Nitrous Oxide isn't carbon dioxide nor to the carts contain carbon dioxide in addition to the Nitrous Oxide you won't really feel a sensation telling you to inhale. You still need oxygen. This is why Nitrous Oxide can be dangerous, ignorant users don't feel a need to get normal air and so keep on suckin' on that sweet rubber balloon teat. Thus they're depriving their brain of oxygen and end up with brain damage. So get some breaths between ""hits"".

Other than that, go get some of that *Icy Fun Air***™** an have a good time. Best combinations include; LSD, Shrooms, Ketamine, Weed, **and air**.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  Some people have brought to my awareness that the vitamine b12 deficiencies caused from nitrous may not only be from chronic use. It could possibly be caused from milder usage. So take little periods of cessation where you can take vitamin b12. You need to stop usage because Nitrous Oxide blocks the absorption of b12. Just taking b12 isn't enough, you need to take b12 during periods of Nitrous Oxide cessation.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit #2: Get a trip sitter or sit the fuck down on a couch. If you pass out you don't wanna crack your air-filled noggin on the pavement.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit number fucking three: Some kind redditor brought to my attention the importance of acquiring *food grade* Nitrous Oxide. You can purchase stuff for car mods that contain Nitrous Oxide but it is also mixed with contaminants.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit #4: Nitrous Oxide canisters can have various machining oils and lubricants to help the user pop them open. If you are inhaling multiple and having a little sesh you should crack them through a piece of cloth like a sock, rag, or microfiber towel into your balloon. This will prevent the oils from getting into the balloon and thus into your precious science fair project of a body.",357,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afovzc/stop_spreading_misinformation_on_nitrous_oxide/

15560,Cannabis,"Weed trip, panic attack, depersonalization","So quick background..  I am 24 smoked on and off not regularly, but occasionally. 

Went to smoke at my friends house, we rolled a fairly fat blunt, in a fronto leaf, and smoked it very quickly..  all of a sudden I was super high everything felt like it slowed down. I would love my hands and they would move w juat felt 5 seconds later. My lips went a little numb, as in I would lick them and wouldn't feel it for a few seconds so it felt numb.. 
My friend had moved house..  So this through me off, I forgot where I was. Then all of a sudden I found myself thinking.. who am I? Who are you (my friend..)  freaked out.. text my sister to collect me.

This was January 3rd or so.. haven't quite felt right since..  head feels like it's foggy. Kind of going through depersonalization I think, and I feel a little depressed because of this. 

What I'm looking for is people who have experienced this and know what is it.. and have come through it. 

I think I can come through this..  I just need to feel the love and support and maybe hear a success story or two.

Writing this post is a big step.. I was too afraid to up until now. 

Side note, I've had one or two mini panic attacks since. 

So ya, has anyone had this, and have you come through it. 

I hope this post helps me come through this, and like that.. I hope if anyone else is feeling it we can help you too. Because I definitely think it's beatable and I think things can go back to normal 

Also.. I go the gym a lot and dont drink a whole bunch.. in the month before the night where I smoked that this happened.  I hadn't gone the gym much and had been drinking a lot with it being Christmas. ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afpipp/weed_trip_panic_attack_depersonalization/

15590,Dissociatives,"I fear things will fade over time, but one thing is for sure that we will never forget the time we went to a different world together, not for the rest of our lives","  

What I’m about to try and explain is the strangest thing I have ever had to type in my life, so I hope you will stick with me. As hard as it is for a human brain to comprehend the things that I have seen, I hope you can find some truth and peace in what you are about to read.

After a recent reddit post on telepathy, this story is about my boyfriend and I, we have been together about 3 years and 10 months, we went to different schools but met as high school sweethearts and although we have been through a lot in our short time we have been together (e.g.; a year of long distance) one thing has always stayed the same and that is how much we love each other. Our relationship is the type that could have its own movie, but this is the main turning point that has changed it forever.

I will start from the very beginning, so you can get a sense at how powerful tripping with a genuine soulmate can get, very quickly. We are both at universities now, about an hour away by train so manage to see each other every week. Although we have never really done any drugs other than weed or NOS once or twice- we had never done any together. As interested and clued up as we were about drugs (in particular, Psychedelics). We didn’t really believe that they were great things to do as a couple purely because of the harm they can do with long term use. One evening (Mid November 2018) I was at my boyfriend’s uni flat (I’ll call him A) and I very bravely told him that I wanted to do some sort of Psychedelic such as DMT or LSD and that I was really interested in finding ‘answers’ (a wish probably linked to my anxiety and past occurrence of harm and depression). Surprising to me, A suggested we do MDMA- a substance that initially I’ve never been interested in but thought that I may never get the chance to do it again with him, so we went for it. We have always only ever bought crystals. Long story short, that night we ended up munching through 1.5g between us and it was an insane first roll. As most couples do, we felt connected. As most new drug users do, we got the doses mixed up! But it was a wonderful night in together (note that I perhaps had considerably more hallucinations while on the drug compared to A such as seeing people’s faces mix up or a cave in the corner of the room. A while later when it had metabolised into MDA I saw many 3D shadows such as butterflies flying around the room and a spider that turned into a scorpion that did freak me out a bit!). we did manage to close our eyes and see the same thing. More than extreme empathy or power of suggestion, we were laying there saying was we could see with our eyes shut and all of a sudden were like ‘I saw that too!’. Overall, we felt pleased with our experiences and decided not to abuse these substances but to respect them and use them together and after a 3 month break…. Which lasted only 2 weeks where once again we had shared a gram between us- although this time I didn’t really feel much other than pretty chill and we spoke about things and bonded as a couple but decided to give it a break for a while now! 

Yesterday on the 12th of January was the last time. As the Christmas break comes to an end, we wanted to roll once more before the start of a term full of placements and exams, so we could spend the next 3 months focused on our studies. Variables here are location (we were at my uni flat this time and therefore had to get hold of the MDMA from someone else) and the people around us (my flat mate and ‘trip sitter’ who will be called B in this story). We took about 125mg each of the MDMA trying to dose properly this time. We felt a small sort of come up but nothing like before. We re-dosed 45mg at 90mins but nothing. We ended up finishing the bag together and had about 450mg each in the end. Still nothing. If anything, I felt really disappointed at how weak it felt. We started questioning and are still questioning that if we took really was MDMA as we feel like it could have been MDA or MDMA that was heavily cut, perhaps with something psychedelic – comments on your thoughts are appreciated surrounding this area and we are considering keeping the bag and trying to scrape out what’s left for testing. We messaged the guy who sold us this ‘MDMA’ telling him that basically his stuff was shit and we weren’t really feeling anything, his reply being honest and saying that his friend had some from the same batch and felt the same way about it- so this definitely wasn’t your average MDMA (despite having a small rock in there, when crushed up it did look whiter than our usual yellowish crystal and a lot fluffier). We were planning to do NOS and smoke some what we think was sativa strand weed during our roll but since we just felt chill and very sleepy we went through and had 1 hit each on B’s Bong. Expecting to just get a high from the weed now more than anything. This is when things get a little bit mental. About 10 minutes after smoking I was suddenly thrown into what felt like a parallel universe or different dimension. I felt dissociated as a whole from A and B and I just stand there for a moment unable to move trying to explain to them that I really feel like I may have just died. A and B reassured me and told me to sit down and hearing and holding A helped me really feel like I could try bringing myself back to my dimension that I was supposed to be in.  I was saying ‘you’ll never believe me when I try to explain what I can see’ but shortly later A joined me in my trip. A sudden whoa wait a minute oh fuck we are in the same trip together. Truly, if he hadn’t been there with me I probably would’ve panicked. Here’s how I’m going to describe how things played out. We told B to write everything down but basically, it was as if our lives as we know them are made up of billions and zillions of different pathways. Me and A were being pulled through them in all different directions, seeing past, present and future all at the same time. From my understanding, it’s a bit like a sandwich with parallel universes as the filling and each piece of bread is a north and south pole. One being reality, the universe that we were meant to be in where we could try and get back to being with B and the other which really sets this above any other trip is being in our own dimension separate to everything else. Being at either of these slices of bread used a lot of energy and no matter how much we tried we would get pinged back into the sea of confusion again after a short time. As you can imagine this was very real to us so we tried to stay calm and find each other before finding B and hopefully we would have enough energy together to be able to break through to the real world.  It's important to note that these parallel universes were in a different time scale so like 1 second ahead of or behind each other depending which way we were pulled. So if we were not tapped into each other’s same universe then there would be delays of sounds and actions. almost like time travelling when when it jumped you back to an old memory. every time my boyfriend made a joke for example, his body would stay the same but his brain jumped back to a joke that he made 5 mins ago, so he couldn't make a new one. The trip lasted 3-4 hours even though it felt more like 8-9 hours. I actually started getting nausea toward the end from all the tracers and my body being thrown around the different time frames, like travel sickness and I threw up a tiny bit of water but not much. This ‘trip’ had 2 sections to it so I will explain what we saw in terms of when we were experiencing the time loops. We were trying to tell B what was going on as best as we could but as we got thrown to different places in time we would never finish our explanations since the other parallel dimensions wouldn’t have known what we said. When we get back to the same dimension we could remember again (e.g.; ‘x happened and then x is happening and… oh I forgot what I was trying to say’ ……… ‘oh I remember now I’m back here again!’). We both saw a lot of bright colours. Sounds were louder, skin was sometimes orange. Sometimes literally but sometimes in a cartoon sense too like orange glitches on our skin if we looked too hard. I didn’t experience too much of this but my boyfriend said that his through and tongue felt like it was burning unless he put his hand in front to stop. Around us we could see ourselves in different places, but the visions overlapped the room like 3D paintings to other places on the walls like we could see into them and were usually along the lines of alien spaceship, holograms, arcades, tunnels, a pub and I saw a waiting room. There was a lady at the other end of the room and when B asked what she was doing I said ‘waiting’ and when asked who for I said she was waiting for B. I also saw a baby and said that February 2nd would be an important date in the future. In terms of future A saw a lot of football scores and things similar. When transferring between worlds there were sometimes digital screens to flick through and sometimes like book pages. We would bounce about when leaning backwards like we were leaning out of the dimensions like a pop out book, we could see the paper. When we focused on anything for too long- art, or each other it would turn into a sort of smudged version of itself like a painting, like the energy couldn’t make everything look real all of the time. The coolest and most crazy part of this whole experiences however, was when we managed to pop into our own dimension. This was always ruled by mirrors and symmetry. Sometimes when we held each other tight and got close we would pop into our own world. Everything would be blurred around us and we saw a real-life image of each other not the mirror one. Like we would move at normal speeds, like we were in a cylinder with an outer one spinning around us. We had the same trip AND could tap into each other’s trip. Sometimes the mirror would be horizontal like glass between us that we had to break through to be inside/outside our individual trip. When we were able to breakthrough we were so relieved. Other times the mirror would be vertical. Straight down our faces like those apps that make your face look distorted with a bigger nose one way, or only one eye if you lean the other. When we looked at each other and adjusted ourselves we could line these mirrors up and that’s when we would break through out of our individual (but same) trips, to really be with each other and the rest of the world and my flatmate in blurred vison. We saw the same things in the same ways and it was incredibly real. We used glow sticks and our voices as grounding points as we flicked through the parallel worlds.

If you’re still reading by now, then thank you and I hope you can leave some comments on any experiences you have had or what you think happened. I haven’t been able to find much on couples being inside each others trip, only sort of having connections when tripping together- we were on another scale we could go to a whole new world- we didn’t just see some shit, we *went* places. When my boyfriend left this afternoon, his mum picked him up and I saw she had some kind of aura around her, a glow just like my boyfriend had. Even when he got in the car she said he looked really handsome today! 

What I’m about to say is to be taken lightly but not mocked as it is very real to us and we feel as though others that have been able to do this know these secrets too. It almost feels like if I refer to the sandwich analogy, that the universe will pick different pathways for you in life, all predetermined whatever happens, what is meant to be will be. Connections of the soul are real and there is an afterlife. If we died last night, we wouldn’t know because the universe carried us on to the next chapter, the next parallel universe, because we weren’t ready to die. We must finish the overall story (life as you guys reading know it as) first. Like 10000s of pieces of tracing paper all with different lines on meeting at the same ending point. There’s every single possible outcome for every second of your life stored in the universe. Although it’s been a hard day of adjusting to this reality (time moving incredibly fast, overall tiredness and lack of energy), I am at peace as I know now that this is where I am meant to be. I feel like I can help other people, students, parents, grandparents that whatever anxiety you feel, deadlines, relationships, housing, war, this is all our stories that we have been given because we are strong enough to deal with them. The universe decides what comes our way and makes decisions for you. All you have to do is remember that this is exactly where you should be at this place and time. The here and now is the best most supportive and safe place and pieces of you are everywhere around you and the ones you love. I feel not only do I have a better connection with my boyfriend now and therefore feel safer, I feel at peace with who I am, where I am, what’s going on around me and who I have in my life. 

To end this, I would like to say that everybody reading is very welcome to let us know what you think about the experience and if you’ve had any similar. There’s a lot of questions to answer and discussions I want to have. I fear things will fade over time, but one thing is for sure that we will never forget the time we went to a different world together, not for the rest of our lives. Life is precious, and everybody needs to know that. Looking to the future we are not planning on doing any type of drug again. I’m even put off drinking. The thing that everybody who takes Psychedelics wants to see, the answers science can’t answer, well we saw it. We shouldn’t have. It almost feels like we have ‘completed’ drugs. There’s nothing more to find out. The human brain cannot and should not comprehend the powers of matter and the universe, life is mystery and everybody should explore that to the fullest.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afpqca/i_fear_things_will_fade_over_time_but_one_thing/

15595,"""facts""",Random drug facts from UK,"I just thought it would be fun to add a post here containing all the different drug slang terminology and random facts from the UK. I’ll ad more to the list that get added to the comments as I’m very high rn and I can’t remember half of them:

Joints in the UK are mostly referred to as Zoots by younger population and spliffs/doobies etc within the older population and also the younger population. 

Some weird things 

£10 - Benz - 1G of flower

£20 - Eigth - 2G of flower 

£30 - Three Five - 3.5G of flower

£60 - Q - 7G of flower

Yes thats right. 2G of flower is referred to as an eigth? No idea why.

When people say their weed is good, or ask if it’s good they say it’s “loud”. For example I’ll say “this cheese is so loud my guy”.

Shrooms are relatively expensive and uncommon to purchase where I’m from strangely although I don’t think this is the case in other areas. 2CB is very common and I have bought it commonly.

MDMA is sold very cheap on DN I can get 50 - good quality 250mg pills for £40. Or you can buy grams of good quality MDMA for £7-9 a gram. On streets it’s usually £20-25 a gram.
It’s also the very abused and it leaves a remarkable huge effect on the person after they have used MDMA and some of them haven’t bounced back in a few years after stopping.

Ketamine is extremely available and used by seshheads all over. £20-30 a gram.

Police are very lenient over here a lot of the time, the way they deal with things is admittedly okay in terms of the actual confrontations. They won’t abuse u if your caught tripping or fucked in public they usually try to help. 
If your caught with only a few G’s of weed they’ll usually confiscate it and not do much. Sadly they aren’t very tolerant of other drugs and the system is fucked on a government level, which the police force can’t do much about.

15789,Cannabinoids,My Experience with Home Drug Testing,"Hello Community. Like many of you, I enjoy smoking marijuana. What I don't enjoy, is being barred from employment because I fail a drug test. So at the beginning of 2017, I began drug testing myself somewhat regularly to see how long I must abstain from marijuana to test negative. I ordered some drug tests from amazon, here are the tests I used -

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C37VV2/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o06\_\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C37VV2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

&amp;#x200B;

Most of you probably know this, but it's important to note that these tests have a cutoff level. For these tests (and most tests in my experience) the level was  50 ng/mL. This is to say that, while these tests may have said I was negative for marijuana, there still may have been lower levels of thc metabolites in my urine that would be detectable by a professional lab. Something I noted haphazardly in my notes was the strength of the line for the test strips. These tests reveal two lines; the first one is a control line which always shows up, and the second line works as the test line. The line only appears if the sample is negative for THC metabolites. Officially, if the second line shows up AT ALL (no matter how faint), the sample is considered negative for marijuana, but I still felt like mentioning when the line was either faint or wasn't a solid line.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many variables which impact one's test results, some that can be controlled and some that are just up to luck. That being said, here are some details that are likely significant to my results

\-For most of this testing period, I was smoking on average an eighth a month. However, my intake increased after November 2017, particularly after December 2017.

\-I have a BMI of 23.7. While I can't measure my body fat percentage, I have a relatively average to slim build. I also have a sedentary lifestyle and don't exercise often. This is significant, as THC is stored in fat cells, and is released back into the body during exercise.

\-I do drink a lot of water and have a somewhat healthy diet in terms of fruits and vegetables. This keeps the urine from getting too concentrated.

\-When I collected the urine, I began collection at the middle of the stream (unless otherwise noted). This is significant, as urine is most concentrated at the beginning of the stream and more likely to contain THC metabolites.

The imgur link below (if not displayed in the post) shows my results. Overall, I found I would test clean after 72 hours of abstaining. There are some exceptions to this (such as the edible I had), but this was an encouraging finding that I could test clean pretty reliably after less than a week of no weed. The amounts listed are educated guesses, generally assuming a bowl was equal to 0.1 gram. I'm not sure of my weed's potency during this time, but anecdotally I can say it was pretty good shit.

&amp;#x200B;

One confound I had, was that the tests I used towards the end were past their expiration date. I'm not sure how well these tests keep or how accurate the results are. I did keep the tests stored in a cool, dark, dry box, which would be optimal conditions for storing urine tests. I had three negative results using these expired tests, but their expiration calls into question their validity. To test this, my most recent test (1/13/19) was collected just hours after consumption. The fact that this test revealed I was positive does suggest these expired tests are valid, but this is not a sure thing.

In conclusion, learn from my results as much as they apply to you. Pre-employment drug testing sucks, but if you take a little time to understand your own consumption habits and your body's metabolism, you can get around it.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afqz6n/my_experience_with_home_drug_testing/
15792,I :love: Drugs,Methods of testing various drugs?,"I feel that it would be very beneficial to people to find ways to test safety and purity of their drugs. I don't really do much other than stuff you can buy at stores, but I know a very little bit about testing so I'll say what I know. 

I know you can test purity of cocaine by taking the weight, the washing with acetone, drying it, and retaking the weight. Cocaine is insoluble in acetone so you'll be left with much purer blow as well. 

I've heard lots of ecstacy is cut with lye, but a way to make sure what your taking isn't caustic would be to stir it in a glass of water till it's all broken up, then use some universal PH paper and see what it reads. If it's between 6-8 it's not caustic, only barely off neutral at worst. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afqzne/methods_of_testing_various_drugs/

15915,Stimulants,Theobromine,"You guys probably dont know what this is so im gonna explain it to you. The happy relaxed feeling you get when u eat chocolate (particularly dark chocolate) is because of a chemical in cocoa called theobromine. You can buy a legal cheap extract of theobromine insanely easily for only 2$ a gram. Pure theobromine is in the form of a white powder which can either be mixed into water, which is less effective but that doesnt really matter because of how cheap it is, or you can snort it. A normal line is very similar to caffeine and you instantly get a nice energetic buzz, but in higher doses it is quite euphoric. I often do it while working out and I feel as though i have unlimited energy. Great stuff. The only problem is that to get a serious high you have to snort a decent amount and i did get a couple nosebleeds, but other than that, i think its a great, cheaper and safer alternative to cocaine.

My apartment is on the corner of the second floor in my building.

It overlooks the intersection below. If you’ve ever had a second-floor apartment like that or spent much time in one, then you know how close it puts you to the street. Every passing conversation or set of lonely footsteps comes right in through the open window. It’s always like I am right on top of everything happening in the city. Certain sounds give me an idea of what time it is. Waking up at four in the morning before I go to reup with Old Man, the streets are quiet in a way that is unmistakable. And when I wake up after my afternoon nod, there are kids coming home from school walking to catch the bus on the corner and joking with each other.

And when I get bored after things slow down again toward evening, I look out of my window. A homeless man is almost always standing on the corner. He looks like a statue and holds his cardboard sign. I have passed by him a few times since I moved in here. The bearded giant never speaks. Never smiles. Just stands there, even though it’s not a good place to fly a sign, like some vagrant monk praying in the temple of this city with its walls made of pissed against brick and smog stained cement, like a strange, hollow-eyed Baba in his sleepless and transcendental meditation. But two or three times a month, the cops come take him away. There’s never any good reason for it as far as I can tell. It’s like they come get him for not having anywhere else to go, but to be honest, he doesn’t seem to mind.

Like right now, I’m looking out my window. Layers of blue and red flashing light cover the concrete outside. It’s Friday night, and they’re arresting him. His face has the same calm expression it always does. There is no protest. He’s doing what we used to jokingly call the ‘junkie macarena.’ That’s putting one hand on the wall. Then the other hand. After that, one hand goes behind the head. The other follows. Finally, they both go behind the back, one at a time, so that the cop can put handcuffs around his wrists.

The scene is sad to watch. I feel like I know him just from seeing him so much and knowing that he’s practically always there, just outside of my window standing and silent like he’s keeping watch over me or something, and jail is no fun, besides. Others have done way more time than myself, but I’ve spent enough time there to know. It sucks. Last time I was in jail was in Portland, and this guy in there kept going on and on about how he was losing his hair from wearing his hat too much. Really, though, he just hadn’t seen himself without a hat on in a long time. His hair had fallen out regardless of the hat, but the only reason I ever heard him was because the pink, bubble gum shaped earplugs they gave me were miserable rocks that hurt my ears so bad I couldn’t use them.

Anyway. Now, the cops have turned off their lights. The streets are dark again. Those patrol cars pull away. My silent, giant friend has been taken away, and I’m left in my apartment to think about it all. Leticia hasn’t called or texted, just as I thought she wouldn’t. It makes me sad. I look down at my phone. There’s a text from Eddie. It says he’s out and asks me to bring him more, and there’s a missed call from Cowboy, so I call him up. Cowboy gives me a ride to the Lindell Motel and Motor Lodge. Eddie pays me for what I gave him earlier this morning. Cowboy gets two quarter ounces from me and a break in price for giving me a ride. Before we get back to my place, I have him drop me off at a place that sells gyros and walk back.

So, I’m back at my place and eating the gyro and some French fries out of white Styrofoam to go tray and making that obnoxious slurping sound by sucking the last of the liquid out of the ice in my drink through my straw. You know the noise I’m talking about. My mom used to hate it when I made it. Anyway, there’s a knock. I get up and ask who it is through the door.

“Me. Charlie.”

“Okay. Come in.”

I unlock it and open to see him.

“Hey, man.” The kid looks clean.

“Sup, yo?”

“Not much. Thanks for letting me in.”

“Yeah. No problem.”

I shut the door, lock it and walk back to the couch to sit down and finish the gyro.

“I got 15 bucks. Can you help me out.”

“Keep your money, bro. Yeah. I can help you out. Just let me finish this bad boy right here.” I like to call things bad boys. A cigarette can be a bad boy. Cookies can be bad boys. In this case, it’s the gyro I’m about to finish eating.

“Awesome.”

“Where you been?” I ask through a mouth full of pita and lettuce and meat.

“My mom’s.”

“How long were you there?”

“I think a couple of nights.”

“That’s good. What’d you do after you left with Sal and Sharky the other night?”

“You know. Hung out at some guy’s hotel room for a day or two, until he got all crazy and kicked me out.”

“Where were they?”

“Sharky and Sal? Sharky was with me. Sal had taken off before that, but I didn’t have anywhere to go, so I went to my mom’s house. She let me stay. Just tried to get me to go to rehab as like part of me staying there or whatever. I talked her into giving me a few bucks before I took off. Ya know?”

“Yeah?”

“Yeah.”

“Well, I mean you can always try me. I’m not sure I can always have you over or whatever, but it’s worth a shot. I don’t mind having you around.”

“Cool.”

Now, I’m just finishing up the food and walking over to throw my trash away.

“I’m gonna go get my stuff. You have works?”

“Yeah. But I could use a freshy.”

“Okay. I got you.”

When I come back, I break him off some and give him a fresh syringe. The dope doesn’t need to be heated, but I like to do it, just a little bit anyway. It’s the ritual that I’m used to from so many years of the black tar. That stuff has to be cooked. Anyway, the kid does his. I do mine. We put our chins on our chests.

i was in high school and i was with my bf at the time and his best friend. we all smoked a blunt in the woods and then i became very dizzy and weak. first i squatted down bc i felt like i couldn’t stand. next thing i know, i blacked out and came to when i ran into a tree. they looked at me crazy and i just said i didn’t know what was going on. i looked down at my shoes thinking that they were dirty af but they looked to be in great shape still.

after that, i blacked out again and was running through the woods on the trail and was laughing hysterically. i remember coming to and there was jogger i ended up next to and he was looking like what the fuck. i walked back to my bf and his friend and they were in shock. mind you, while i’m spazzing they were doing none of the sorts. we ended up walking back to my car and i remember i was too weak to walk upright so i was holding onto my bf and was leaned down a bit with my eyes closed. what’s hilarious is i said i could see everything although my eyes were closed everything just looked animated.

after that we went back to my car and i ate some crackers and my high came down and i felt normal. when i got home i noticed my shoes were wrecked and i put them through the wash cycle. years later i asked them if the weed was laced with anything and they swore up and down it wasn’t to this day. i do believe them ultimately and i’ve heard people doing random wild shit from weed, has anyone else ever experienced something like this?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afssk7/one_time_i_smoked_weed_and_blacked_out_and_ran/

So I've got a decent amount of HBWR seeds. 
Apparently it's the Indian strain though (bought off eBay). I don't see any visual difference comparing these seeds to some I bought off a reputable smart shop (Hawaiian strain). Deep dark brown color with a whitish fuzzyish layer. So I guess I'll just try them?

Now of course I want to reduce nausea so I'll go for sublingual absorption. Until now I've just read about people chewing the seeds and then spitting them out after a while. 

What if you grind them, extract them in cold water + lemon juice for an hour and then swish around that extract in your mouth and finally spit it out? Does it make sense? Does it make any difference? Any experience with that?


I haven't done LSA before so I'd like to have the best possible experience. I've done LSD (supposedly) a couple of times before.

Also I was looking into microdosing LSA with the seeds and I've come across a lot of posts with various different dosages, techniques and experiences. Does anybody have a (for him/herself) good ""recipe"" for microdosing HBWR? Does nausea even kick in when ingesting just few (1-2?) seeds?

There was someone who posted a Remindme comment for a year, but the thread was locked so I couldn’t respond to their comment to let them know how everything has been. Not sure if update posts are really encouraged here but I thought why not?

It hasn’t been a year yet, but it sure as hell feels like it has been. We got married March 16th, and tripped our balls off that evening at a treehouse resort in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. And of course when you’re gonna trip with a significant other, there’s probably gonna be some fooling around involved. And oh hell there was a lot of fooling around going on, it was the most amazing sex experience I ever had. While we were doing the deed at one point, I remember a vision of myself with a baby bump, and seeing the process of a sperm fertilizing an egg. It was very weird, but I remember it vividly. 

On April 5th, my husband and I were up in the morning to take him to work. I had told him I hadn’t started my period yet and was curious as to why. Background on that, my husband and I stopped using protection in July of 2017, in hopes of getting pregnant. I was tracking my ovulation for months, but nothing was happening, so we quit tracking and we decided if it was gonna happen, it’ll happen. Anyways, he told me to take a test. I had a stockpile of tests but I felt no different. I had no signs of pregnancy or any signs my period was coming soon, so I figured well I’m just late like I am every month, since being off birth control my periods were very irregular and I was always “late”. So I thought nothing of taking a test. 

I had a cheap one (88 cent to be exact) from Walmart, so I put some pee in the little dropper and activated it. I went and got dressed and my husband was getting ready downstairs, and I went back in the bathroom to look at it. And it was very faint, but a definite positive. I was so shocked. I yelled to my husband “uh, you better come up here and look at this test!” He looked and couldn’t believe it, and gave me some money to get a better test. I dropped him off at work, went and bought a nice digital test, and went to my grandmothers to take it since I couldn’t wait any longer. Within a few minutes it popped up “Pregnant”. I sent him a picture and said “is this convincing enough for you?” And he said yep. So it was official. I got pregnant on my honeymoon!! 

I don’t wanna make this any longer, but my due date said my date of conception would’ve been March 16th, the day of our wedding and the day we tripped on acid. It could have honestly been any day before or after that, but I like to believe I got pregnant while tripping my ass off in a treehouse. 😂

On December 13th I gave birth to our beautiful baby girl. We both wanted a girl, and she is so perfect. We are so in love with her. She has two amazing big brothers as well, we are so lucky to have the family we do. 

I’ll end this here since it’s almost 4 am, I’m sleep deprived and she’s awake for a feeding. I will say this, I MISS WEED! 😭😂 I am breastfeeding so I am cautious of smoking/ingesting anything with THC. But, baby girl is so worth waiting to get high again.

16266,warning,The nocebo effect and drugs. Can you actually die from thought?,"Warning: please don’t read this If you don’t want your psychedelic experiences altered as I feel this might be tapping into the territory of something that could be deadly from a mental perspective. Obviously this is all speculation but nevertheless it’s been something on my mind and really has me thinking about sharing and even possibly educating the warnings of this. Unfortunately it’s a self-destructive warning though.
So if for some reason I ruin everyones experience with a drug because of this “awful reminder” I’m sorry. It’s just eating away at me and I wanna get it out there. 

So I’m going to keep this post relatively short and I invite you guys to do some research on some of the jargon and topics of this pondering. 

So basically the nocebo effect creates an extremely strong psychological influence that has also been the cause of death in some instances if the effect is casted towards a negative aspect.

So the simple idea here is that more times than not most drugs create an elevation with our thoughts as well as experiences and will even open up subconscious parts of our mind. Hence why we tend to lucid dream or our dreams (all the weird shit you see when on drugs) become a part of our conscious reality. 

So if you started to think that you were going to die. You would ask yourself how exactly?
From that you break it down right. 

You can see that in a physical setting you’re safe.
However in the mental state. You ask yourself a simple question that could jeopardize your physical state.. could a thought kill me?

Could I actually unwillingly die due to my own subconscious?

The unwillingness part comes from the phrase of “trying not to think about penguins” 
Because obviously as soon as you ask your second question of “could I unwillingly die from my subconscious?” It’s not like you can just retreat that thought.

Then you start pondering the idea that your subconscious brain is connected to all of your body and the final killer question is “whether or not I will unwillingly allow my heart to stop beating or turn my brain off”

Being under the influence or even sober and in deep concentration would it be possible to link the processes in your head and unwilling tell them to stop working. 

Then it goes back to the “penguin” thought of “can a thought kill me?”

and if you question it and think it’s silly.. there’s still a cold fact underneath that says:

“Well I simply don’t know if it’s possible or impossible”

 and the uncertainty of that statement is soo powerful that it could put you in a thought loop and a scary one too

Now I don’t know Anatomy and Psychology well enough to confidently say that it would be physically impossible to influence yourself enough to subconsciously end your own life.

But the speculation is pretty terrifying. 

Like I’ve heard stories of different types of animals dying from shock or something similar to the nocebo effect.

So it just has me curious with a slight hint of dread; to think about how our inability to subside a thought, mixed with the questions/thought loop of

 “could I actually die from thinking it. Now I can’t stop thinking it. What is happening”

Actually lead to someone dying. 

I guess the most reassuring thought about this is that as humans we naturally forget a lot of things due to so many impulses and other things to think about in society that you will most likely forget about this post and not bother to ponder on these thoughts the next time you take drugs.

A small little backstory: I was treading carefully with this idea while under the influence of marijuana. I choose weed because it tends to get me in a thoughtloop and deep into my head, however I couldn’t imagine this with LSD. Anyways a scary recollection of mine when I started pondering the idea of this post, I had to physically move myself or start interacting with something to change my mental impulse when I noticed that my heart rate started increasing dramatically. 

Edit: spelling and some reassurance added to the bottom, or is it. I don’t know. I also have a backstory",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afugoe/the_nocebo_effect_and_drugs_can_you_actually_die/

16301,Psychedelics,Did too much but it was worth it,"Last saturday I did 2C-B with 3 other people and there was 1 tripsitter, we took 20 mg at around 9 PM and we started tripping. I was seeing geometric patterns, eyes, different colors and a lot of pink. At around 12 AM I smoked 1 bongfill of weed and started tripping way harder and one of my friends (M1) drank 9 shots of vodka, M1 took 140 mg XTC with the 2C-B and smoked some weed. 

He was pretty fucked up, I went to the toilet and the tripsitter banged on the door that M1 wasn't doing good. I calmly walked back to my room and I saw M1 on the floor and he forgot how to breathe, his pulse was also very weak. The tripsitter was panicking like crazy, I chuckled and said ""If he blacks out he can breathe again because his body will relax"", he almost blacked out and we gave him some food and water.

After that I went to lay in my bed and I was tripping like crazy for about 3 hours, I started listening to music and I jammed like never before. At around 3 AM I was almost at the end of my 2C-B trip so I took 280mg of XTC, I started tripping harder than ever before. I was still listening to music and everything I could see was hallucinations so I couldn't see, at the peak of the XTC everything was flashing black and white very rapidly. M1 was talking again so we where like ""you beat death you crazy motherfucker, that rocks""

After the peak I went to the toilet, I couldn't pee and I saw that my pupils where so big that I couldn't see my iris anymore, I also noticed blue foam around my mouth which was indeed real.

At around 7 AM the XTC was wearing off, so I took 9 datura seeds. And datura being a deliriant I was seeing people that weren't there, I also saw about 50 people walking around my room. My friends told me that I was sitting motionless for about 3 hours before I talked again.

My pupils where dilated until 6 PM, I fell asleep at around 3PM. I mostly slept trough the XTC dip and right now i'm feeling pretty fucking great, it was an amazing party lol.

I am probably not gonna do hard drugs for a month to recover.

16350,Quetiapine,"Sleeping 11 to 12 hours on seroquel/quentiapine, ruining my daily life, but its the only drug that works","
Hey guys.
Eight years ago I suffered from depression, gad and bipolar disorder so much it was ruining me and my life. I finally decided to go to doctor. She gave me this seroquel pills which made me sleep a lot, but made my thoughts go finally back to normal.

I was 27, and for the first time I couls study normally so I enrolled in college. It was all great, until this sleeping effect lasted for way too long. The moment my psychiatrist stopped giving me seroquel is the moment everything went to hell.

Didnt really noticed it at first, but then anxiety, depression and suicisal thoughts came back to me. So long story short, i was on and off some antidepressants which did not work for me. I am using some xanax related benzos called praxiten for sleep.

And after seven years of hell i am back on quentiapine, basically the same stuff as seroquel. I am using the lowest possible doze, 25mg, but it does not work, i am still sleeping way too long, and its the same effect if i use 100mg of it. 

I am using it for 6 months now, I think I am a bit more stabile, but its ruining my life. I dont work, dont go to college. Yesterday I went to sleep in 00.30h am, and I woke up today in 2pm. I feel extremely guilt.

What should I do?
I am thknking about trying to use it in the morning, but nobody usebthis drug like this.

16355,Cannabis,A red turtle was chasing me on MDMA and Weed,"Lets get things straight real quick . . .

Done caps a couple of times, smoked weed a plenty full of times but never have I ever had an experience were both drugs were involved . . .

Quick story: context
My house, all my mates, everyone except 1 person isn’t doing caps but is instead smoking weed. Everyone can smell the weed as the person left the bathroom door open and I spent about 10m in total in a foggy bathroom clearing up the smoke and cleaning bud trays for the boys (mind you this is an hour after I had taken my first cap).

I take my second cap and all is fine, I tell my mates I have to piss and I go back to the bathroom to do my duty,

*whoooosh* 

My eyes begin to roll back as I twitch in place whilst taking a piss haha

But . . .

Then I see it . . .

A giant floating red turtle is flying around me as I enter and re enter conciousness, I pull my dick back into my pants and I walk outside we’re my mates are as I’m looking back at the now curious red turtle, 

“ there’s a red turtle following me”

a couple stares and a hand to my shoulder encourage me to take a seat whilst discouraging comments like “yep, you’ve had enough for today” and “mate, take a seat” murmur from my friends.

Lol this cunt is still floating around me Aha wtf is goin on . . .

Soooo my question stands. If I were to drink 40mg of dxm every night and trip as hard as someone else that is drinking say 200mg every night, will we suffer the same side effects that come with dxm abuse?

I know many of you will say what I'm feeling is placebo, but I really don't think it is.

These tabs have actually been sitting for over a year without use, so potency might be low. They were pretty normal low dosage to begin with. My previous experience with LSD didn’t produce any sort of negative experiences. 

Why do I want to trip today: I was laid off from my job last week and I’m feeling very directionless in life at the moment. I’m hoping to gain some sort of introspection or SOMETHING. I’ve been trapped in these thoughts that I’ll never be successful on my own and I KNOW that’s not true. I remember LSD making me feel happy about life. 

Reasons not to: Well, I’m depressed. Obviously losing my job hasn’t been great for me. I have some suicidal ideation from time to time, though I tell myself I’ll never actually DO it. 

I’m in the northeast US — not exactly the best time of the year but definitely short scenic walkable. I have an apartment all to myself stocked with video games, movies, VR, etc. I also have Klonopin prescribed in the event I need to calm down.

We had people shootin on the regular but he didn’t intend to kill him. The gang a couple block down had stole a bag of about 70/80 bottles of hydrocodone.  As he dropped me off at my house I wondered if I would see him again. He drove off into the distance. I remember needing to smoke a cigarette. My homie from two houses down ran up to my porch asking if I knew that ***** capped let’s call him Pablo. We smoked a couple squared before the cops show up asking for him, we said he left. They were going to come back with a. Warrant eventually and my house was hot with guns and a shitload of oxys. I had moved of from selling other drugs besides opioids, I knew they were addicting and that people would come back. Heroin and pcp were occasionally sold by myself but, the pills were making me rich.  Even after I lost everything to them the greed controlled me. 
I walked back into my house and fell on the couch and drifted off. 

     Waking up the next morning I walked to his house. I must have forgot what happens because I was knocking on his door for 20 minutes, and eventually gave up. Fast forward 3 months we were on better terms w the gang 2 blocks down. One of them told me that ***** was found dead in a dumpster.  I knew one of them killed him. But they were making us money. I wanted to kill every last one of them I’d go to jail at that point had nothing left besides money. Boss told me “not to do a damn thing” I wasn’t going to listen I drove to there main dubs house, I had the strap in the back of my car which I had only owned for protection reasons.  I ran up and started pounding on the door, I remember his girl and his kid opened the door up. I just held it to her head. I don’t know why but something inside me just wanted revenge. The kid starts crying he runs down the stairs and just looks me in my eyes. 

I wasn’t going to kill her I wanted him but I front of his kid, I remember just putting the strap down and turning around walking out the door. Drove for hours just not knowing what to do. I wanted to drive my car off the bridge. I will end it there ",83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afzom7/last_straw/
16653,Cannabis,"3 Benzedrex, 3.5g shrooms, clonazolam, and .5g of weed","Don’t know what I’m doing because I’m blacked on clonazolam so I buy 3 benzdrex because my ride was getting a bunch of pizza to cook when we got back home (benzo mumchies) and was stoked to get stimmed as I love stims personally.

We got home, popped them all open then let them soak in coke for 60 minutes. Take them out and slam the lavender drink back like it’s nothing.
I said to myself, “You need more drugs you pussy. Go out with a bang, you PEICE of shit”.
Now I’m literally mad at myself for talking shit and basically just said fuck it and took my grinded shrooms and swallowed all of them. I was chewing for an hour or so then it got weird.

The shrooms were kicking in HARD as I thought the benzo would kill most of it. But nope. I could feel the benzdrex hitting my stomach like a molly roll. Now I get up from my bed then I’m straight to the floor. Stuck laying in eurphoria and visuals. 


Ego death came and went as well. Just back and forth but coming down on everything was when it got crazy. I was nearly so depressed I wanted to kill myself. These don’t mix well but do at the same time. The visuals we’re very electric like lsd instead of more natural like shrooms. 
Every time my music played, it was a roller coaster of emotions that made me feel like all types of way. 

I eventually fall asleep of more clonazolam.

Summary: Don’t be a fucking idiot. This benzo takes me down a road of past addictions (excluding shrooms) and completely makes me act like a retard.

16654,Psychedelics,Long term tolerance?,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi all! I have done a total of about 20 trips of shrooms, 2cb or LSD of varying doses and with pauses of up to 6 months in my life and somehow no trip - in particular the visual side of it - ever comes close to my first one. Not even remotely.

Whenever I do psychs I feel as if something in my head is being compressed, leading  to some headaches and diminishing my experience (i.e. almost no visuals or auditory hallucinations). After a few hours the headache passes, but with it also the intensity of the trip. I still feel ""high"" on an emotional level/have trippy thoughts, and other friends are fully tripping off similar doses of the same drugs.

Is it possible that I have developed some sort of permanent tolerance, blocking the ""full"" experience (especially the visual side)? Do you have any suggestions on what I could do to enhance the visual aspect that I enjoy so much?

Friends have recommended smoking weed/CBD. Any thoughts on that?

Thanks in advance for any comments and suggestions :)",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afzxju/long_term_tolerance/
16659,I :love: Drugs,I have became addicted to drug dealing and don't know how to stop.,"I've been drug dealing for the past 4 years now. I did have a year where I didn't sell anything but besides that, it's been pretty steady. The problem is, I just don't think I can stop. It's become an addiction. I don't give a fuck about getting high. I smoke weed and drink alcohol occasionally but, besides that, I haven't touched another drug.

There's probably a lot that has lead up to this point, starting from a young age, but 4 years ago I found the markets and Bitcoin. It was at a point in my life where things were low and I found drug dealing. My first package was a package of Xanax bars. I made $1,000 profit in about 4 days because, at the time, pressed bars weren't very well known so my prices were dirt cheap compared to everyone else's. 

That's the moment things changed for me. The moment where I fucked everything up for myself.

4 years later, here I am. It's a fucking addiction. When I stop, it's for a month, max besides the one year I quit due to personal and OPSEC related reasons. It's a craving I can't make go away. The adrenaline of doing something illegal, the money, the respect, the power you have over your little group of people...I don't know...it's impossible for me to explain so I'll explain the more addicted part now.

The money.

You think drug dealing will ruin your life because of prison or getting robbed, and while true, there's a sneakier way nobody tells you about; MONEY. I've dropped out of college and haven't held down a job more than 6 months due to it. When you make $55-75K a year WITH NO TAXES, everything else is a blur. College? That takes 4 years of being broke! I can't do that! Holding down a minimum wage job? That's like $400 a week, if you're busting ass. I was making $1,000(PROFIT, not GROSS) a week, making a couple moves. I moved bulk only so I wasn't meeting people every 30 minutes to make my money.

I was my own boss and money gave me freedom. Freedom. That's where the addiction comes into play. Drug dealing was 50% of it but the other 50% was the freedom money gave me.

I make about, on average, $4,000 NET profit a month. My monthly bills are only around $1,800 for everything besides food(Love living in a cheap state) so that leaves me a good chunk of change to myself. That leaves me $2,200 a month in my own pocket. This monthly cost includes a maid, once a week, dropping my clothes off at a laundromat to get washed, dried, and folded, and having my groceries delivered to my house. 

I have all the time in the world to myself. It's so addicting.

Want to go play Laser Tag and ride Go-Karts all day? You can! Want to go do 18 holes Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday? Grab some cigars and let's go! Want to take a week long vacation? Easy, all you gotta do is tell your people that you're leaving and to re-up while they can! Then you're free to leave! Want to smoke weed and play video games all day? Done! Want to learn a skill like playing piano, programming, or anything? You can practice 8 hours a day!

I'm not even mentioning the material items. I have a PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Gaming PC, MacBook, TaylorMade golf club set, Boosted Board, HTC Vive, 4K TV's, all the smart home gadgets an apartment can have(Lights, outlets, TV's, ect), and clothes galore. I also have a pretty decent car. If I don't have it, I have multiple options to get it. I can either save up and wait, trade product for it, or just up my sales to cover the cost.

Oh, that's another thing you can't do with a paycheck, upping your sales. If I need money or just want to thicken the savings account, I can just push my sales a little harder. Offer a slight discount for more bulk, bring in a different product, or seek out new customers. $6,000 months are not crazy uncommon. Drugs sell themselves. 

So yeah, you can see where everything becomes an addiction. Life is just...easy. Drugs sell themselves. Money gives you freedom. It's a bad mix.

The problem is quitting. I could quit today and have a pretty decent savings to hold me over but after that, I'd have nothing. I have no college education and no work experience I'd be willing to put down on a resume. I have no references. I have no legal connections. I have nothing besides the business I've. built around myself. Surrounded by people who do the same thing that I do.

I have a couple moves I could make but my motivation is shot. I could go back to college, that's a great option. I could hone in on my weed growing skills and save up for when legalization comes to my state. I could build a legit business. 

For now though, I'll stick to what I know and what I'm good at. Hoping to find the dragon I'm chasing.",2301,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/afzylu/i_have_became_addicted_to_drug_dealing_and_dont/

16678,Methamphetamine,What is your experience of smoking weed when up for 3-4 days on meth?,"Holy shit, ok lol i'm a little scattered brained right now so i'll try to keep it to the point. Long story short, i;ve tried every drug, and ice (meth) has always been the one that has always been the easiest to come across my way. I have had many experiences on it, and although it was only my favorite drug when I had a boyfriend (it's way more fun with someone else, endless fun). Anyways normally i'd only use it once every few months or even less, because the comedown left me feeling depressed and i would never buy more than half a gram or be awake past 50 hours. Well anyways, since I can never find the drugs of my choices, i gave in and got some ice 4 days ago (80 hours ago to be exact). I would ideally be an injector, because I love the rush of the drugs, but sadly even though im slim my veins are very hard to find and so I just smoked it (I used to snort it since I only use recreationally). 
Well after a million times, I know how to get pretty good hits and what not, and this ice I got is the best i've had my first time getting a rush that strong. By 4-5 hits my head feels heavy and tingly along with my body. Now i've always heard and read about the intense experiences people have on meth, especially those who become addicted to it and stay for many days. Shit, I can't go past where i'm at right now 80 hours beginning of 4th day. Either way had my fun and at the at the end of the 3rd day, 72 hour mark I decided to finish what I had. Now by this point, I got so high but I was finally starting to get some mild hallucinations. If I didn't leave music or TV on, I could hear voices of my parents yelling at me, or the cops coming etc. Still was dissappointed not to get to see any any special visuals etc. But I finally got a hold of some weed, since 





I usually only smoke weed (I'm lucky i've dodged addictions so far to harder drugs because I can't tolerate the side effects). So I smoke a few bowls and of course feel so relieved physically, and had an amazing body high better mood. I felt real good and I turned on the music and was using my laptop when I noticed the music sounded way too loud and heard the neighbors talking about calling the cops. I then lowered the volume only to realize it wasn't even halfway as loud as I listen to it sober. But no matter how much I kept lowering it, it still sounded way tooo loud. I went downstairs several times to ask my sister, if the music is way too loud she kept saying no. At the same time, I noticed finally some slight shadows kinda like everywhere, like nothing vivid just kinda looked smokey everywhere. Then the carpet or ground looked like it was slightly moving and I started hearing voices even louder, like conversations of people talking shit about me, but I tried to remind myself I was expecting this by the 72 hour mark and smoking 8 hits of kush. But I didn't expect the weed to intensify as much as it probably feels to be awake more like 5 days. I got real nervous and took some xanax, and I felt so highhh, like I felt like the ground was moving the whole time I was on my bed. Like it felt a little shakey, felt like someone was walking around real loud upstairs. I also noticed their was so much ringing to the point it was very interesting. I could constantly hear loud police sirens (I do live near a police station, you could hear them often in the distance but this was like If their were in front of my house. I could hear every crack and random noises the house was making, and kept feeling like the presence of others in the room or around me. I also felt like I could hear my thoghts outloud. Anyways gosh I made that too long, well things tamed down, and I just took a lot of lyricas (they work so euphoric for anxiety). And decided to just get through the rest of the day, so I can experience a little more. So once again kept hearing voices but everything got better after the high wore off like 4 hours ago. Now right now I finally see some shadows and everything feels like it's kinda shaking, and ironically my body is a little numb. Also I always read about the bugs thing, and people describe the sensation as really real, well I keep feeling these sharp things stabbing my skin, and sometimes I look and it's a small piece of meth. I don't know if it feels like the bug thing, but it feels like being poked by a sharp piece of glass for a second in different parts of the body. The sirens, and cars on the highway sound more loud and annoying then ever. Anxiety comes and goes, I realize the more I focus on the anxiety the worse it gets and the louder and more serious the voices get. The more I try to distract the less I notice them. Music videos look more trippy, I just can't wait to smoke weed in a few hours when my dad leaves to work. (If I smoked right now, I swear I could imagine just laying down trying not to freak out and hear him say all sorts of stuff, etc). 





Thinking of how much the weed intesified the ""psychosis"" and experience in general, i'm curious how much more is it gonna do with this high dose of lyrica. I notice a lot more details, and if I sit in one spot I can easily stare at something and zone out. Anxiety comes and goes, I just hope to get more visuals because I know they increased so much after the weed. So did my hearing, I can hear some real noises that are so far away that I normally can't hear. Sometimes when you get more paranoid actual bad things happen more, (even though sometimes you can't control it) And usually the more you can tolerate it the less bad happens. So for me personally this will be the longest i've been awake on meth recreationally, I know some people have been awake for upto even 15 days, but even if I still had more meth I would naturally still be able to fall asleep or have these weird blackouts where I just fall asleep without remembering and wake up in random places. So that will be 85 hours 4 days in a few hours when I smoke a lot of kush, I just hope it' s a great high,,but I have to try hard to fight the anxiety. Omg I am looking at the wall and whichever part I stare at starts turning from white color to yellowish and moves around wherever I look LOL! I wish I had access to acid, love psychadelics can never find them. I'm hoping to see an actual shadow monster I am guessing I 85 hours with kush is enough to see atleast something when I finally look out that window tonight before ending this experience. Basically I feel in some ways sleep deprivation connects with the spiritual side of the world (If you believe in religion). What people describe seeing spirits, sometimes some voices or things said that sounded very real. Also often feeling the presence of other things around you, I honestly always have thought meth came from the devils asshole lol. Too bad I probably won't get much more hallucinations enough to see the other side of the world. Oh btw I start to forget what i'm doing or feel real dreamy as well. Fuck, why the annoying auditory hallucinations, instead of the cool trippy stuff. Oh sorry lastly, I keep seeing flashes sometimes in random places. It's like if someone took a picture with a camera real quick, like a quick random noticable flash. I wonder what is that. Omg so sorrrrrry for making this so long. Wish me luck, as usual crystal your so sweet but you can be one of the baddest bitches as well. Ugjhhh cant't stop talking. Btw the bigger rush and higher I got when smoking meth, the more mellow ""calm"" I got instead of hyper. I get hyper when the rush wears off, but sometimes after a good 5-6 fatass hits, I wanna just sit their and nod out slightly and feel the amazing music in my body. Ok ok ok i gottta shut uppppp. Any suggestions anything particularly trippy or something to do in this state of mind that is fun or feels good (besides sex).",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ag0am0/what_is_your_experience_of_smoking_weed_when_up/

I let some dude hit a gum and he said his mouth didn’t get numb, then i let him hit a line and he still didn’t want it. I was confused bc it was from my friends plug that he always copped good shit from. So i tried some and literally didnt feel or taste a thing.

2nd time : bought 1.5g that came in 3 .5g packets in powder for w baby rocks. My friend got it for me so i couldnt make sure it was rock. Ended up tasting like fucking pills, felt like ass, wondered why people did coke, so it was probably pills

3rd time: Oh boy..... I complained to my coke head friends about the times i did bad coke so they said come here buddy gotta show u sum. Little baby rocks of what smelled like gas in a little bag. I didnt have much to do so i said fuck it and copped a gram and now i see why people like this shit. Scary cause i can easily understand how easy it would be to get addicted.

Long time reader, first time poster. 
I’ve been an avid weed smoker for over a decade now, but I think it’s time for me to grow up and, if not stop, at least cut down my use to weekends only and not every morning, afternoon and night. 

It’s costing too much, and it’s starting to hold me back from achieving so much more. It’s about to cost me my relationship too. 

Any advice on how I can cut down dramatically without losing my shit. I’ve been smoking pretty much full time for 10 years. Sure, ive had breaks here and there, but nothing longer then 3 months. 

I use it to deal with my anxiety but now I’m using my anxiety as an excuse to continually smoke weed. 

I just want to be normal without having to be higher then a kite. 

Any advice appreciated!

Well my roomate recomended a new tennant to the owner.  The guy even offered to do the cleaning himself.  Well today i smelled a fishy scent comming fr the basement door and when i went down to ask him to air the place out a bit i noticed primatine (ephedrine hcl) blister packs laying next to the garbage can.

And when I asked my roomate how he knows the new tennant he says ""well i used to get meth from him bit i swear hes clean"".  Tf do i do.  I hope the guy knows that the furnace is in the basement apartment so if he decides to break out any methanol or kerosene I guess we all die.

16997,Long Post,"My dad died, so I cleaned out the medicine cabinet and ran away to live on the streets.","  

My father was a doctor.

I haven’t told you that yet. I wanted to, but it never seemed like a good time. Now, you know, though. He was a doctor. And something else, which I’ve sort of shared before, is that I didn’t really know him. I mean. I knew him, but I guess what I’m trying to say is that I didn’t know who he was, and the problem with that is that it’s left me in this strange personal prison of not knowing who I am. My identity, or lack thereof, is bound up in his, whether I like it or not. 

He took me to flea markets often when I was a little kid. I’ve told you that. We used to listen and sing along to John Prine cassette tapes or Warren Zevon in his truck when I was that age. I never told you that part. There were weekly reminders that ‘everything was mostly nothing’ or that if we see something as a certain color, blue for instance, then that something is actually not blue. It’s everything else. We only see it as blue, because it’s not absorbing those wavelengths of light. Things like that. It was weird, and there was the day my mother put me in the car and took me away from him for a decade. 

My dad stood in the driveway. I remember that. He had the front tires of his Volkswagen up on a pair of yellow metal ramps and a wrench in his hand and wore a light blue pair of gym shorts that rode way up top of his white, hairy legs. Anyway, once my mom remarried and we’d moved away, I used to wonder why he didn’t do more to try to stop her, but now I think that he just didn’t know what was going on. He waved and smiled at me sitting in the back seat as we pulled out. There was a long cigarette hanging from his lips. He was 59 if I’m doing the math right.  

My mother had taken the things that really mattered to her out of the house one by one and put them into a small storage unit across town. We lived in a hotel after that. The divorce went through. I never saw him or even talked to him again, until she got tired of me smoking pot in her new husband’s giant house and sent me back to live with him my at the beginning of my sophomore year in high school. 

Sometimes, I think that when she took me away from him and divorced him like that, it killed him, because he was sick within a month of me moving back in. Then, the doctors had him on so much morphine and oxycontin that his mind turned mushy. He had pale broomstick arms and legs. Episodes of dementia came and went besides. There were a few surgeries. He gargled every breath through what he called the ‘liquified lung soup’ in his throat, and even when he couldn’t breathe without the oxygen hose to his nose and had become too skinny and cold to get out of bed, he’d poke his face out from under the covers to ask me for another one of his ‘Pell Mells’ with that wiry, thin-lipped smirk of his. The comforter and carpet had thin black rectangles of charred fabric all over them from when he dropped the lit cigarettes between his geriatric nods.

Before the divorce, I’d been too young to understand him, really, and through those three years of sickness he was a character, but it wasn’t him. Not really. It was just some mixture of too many opioids in his blood and his mental decline and the depths of a dying man’s cynicism. He was fun to talk to, though. He told me about those termites. We read books together. He introduced me to Vonnegut. My dad told me how he was happy to not be practicing medicine anymore.

“I had to look at and handle complete strangers’ genitals in the first few minutes of meeting them. Ask about their urine and stool. Sometimes, I had to get a sample. Other times, I had to tell them they needed to see a specialist because they were in a bad way. Glad to be done with that crap.” He used to say.

“But what about helping people, dad?” I’d ask.

“What about it?” He’d smile.  

His brother Benny came to visit him with my aunt one time. They left, and my dad told me how Benny had always been an embarrassment for him, how his younger brother tagged along with him and his buddies and this girl he liked one time. When they met up with the girl, Benny started telling her stories that were obviously not true, but she was just too nice not to tell him he was obviously lying. After a while the subject of losing teeth came up in their little group. My dad looked over from the bed with wide eyed horror and told me,

“Randy,” my dying father put his palms against his forehead, closed his eyes and grunted, “Benny told her that his teeth grew back, and so you know, she said, ‘That’s not how it works, Benny.’ Just trying to be nice, and then he tells her that he’d lost four different teeth three times already and every time they grew back. I couldn’t believe it!” He looked up at the ceiling dramatically and left his mouth wide open. “I just couldn’t believe it. He was a liar and a maniac. Still is, Randy. He still is.”

At the beginning of my junior year, one of the German exchange students at school dated me for a week or so before she broke it off. Her rejection just about killed me. I would wake up at four in the morning to retch bile the color of highlighter ink into the toilet. My dad empathized. He told me that before I was born and he ever met my mother, he’d had a girlfriend for several years while he was in med school, but her parents wanted her to marry a Jewish guy, because they were Jewish or whatever. Anyway, she’d moved up to the Pittsburgh area for a job and asked my dad to come visit her. They’d pretty much already broken up and all that but still talked on the phone long distance. 

He told me,

“I only spent two days there. It rained the whole time, but she smiled at me so big once that I could see the gums above her teeth. I knew it was going to work out then. I thought, ‘She’s never smiled like that before. This is it! I’m the one! She loves me.’” 

He wasn’t the one. She didn’t love him, and it didn’t work out, either. My father told me about how he knew another man was in the apartment with her on one of their long-distance phone calls and how he hyperventilated and cried over the line and never talked to her again after that. He was living all alone trying to establish a practice as a doctor, and his calico cat got run up a tree and never came down. My old man told me about how he developed a severe case of hemorrhoids while all that was going on and how he had to use one of those donuts to sit everywhere he went. As he told it, we laughed hysterically. He laughed at his own experiences with misery until there were tears in his eyes. It made me feel better about my own. He understood pain.  

Once he died, my grandmother shared how hard my grandfather had been on him. You see, his father survived the Bataan Death March in WWII and lost his leg from an infection before he came back. He was born into a tougher people from a tougher time. My dad had grown up over the years he’d been at war, and when he came home, he was seriously confused and disappointed by his little boy. His son, my dad, liked to read and come up with stories and study or draw up his own comic strips on the weekends. He didn’t like getting dirty or playing ball and would not touch a gun or go hunting. It killed his dad in a way, and when my uncle Ben was born, the baby got all the attention. I don’t know what any of that means. It’s just what my grandmother told me. Pieces to this puzzle I don’t get.  

 My last exam of high school was on a Tuesday morning. I’d already been up to see my dad smoke a cigarette and have another one of his coughing fits. That was at about six. He barely ever slept. I think it was because he knew death stood at his door and as such didn’t want to spend any more of his time alive looking like he was dead, if he could help it, and before I left at a quarter to nine that morning, I went to kiss the old man on the forehead and tell him I’d see him that afternoon. He was cold. I rolled back the covers to see his clouded eyes and felt his chest. Nothing. For some reason, maybe the grief, I put this old silver dollar that he used to keep on the nightstand by his ashtray in my pocket with some of his peppermints. I don’t know why. Maybe, just because they were tangible things that reminded me of him, things I could take with me. 

I never made it to my last exam. He had several hundred pills left, so I took them with me, too, which got me in with some no goods traveling south on the I-5 corridor. Before Sunday rolled around, I was homeless on the streets of San Francisco with a needle in my arm for the first time in my life, high on meth and heroin at 18 years old. That’s the way my life went. That’s what I did with it after the old man died. ",131,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ag39yy/my_dad_died_so_i_cleaned_out_the_medicine_cabinet/
17036,Alprazolam,"Xanax, Adderall, Valium, or Klonopin for social anxiety","I'm going to my psychiatrist this week for my bi-monthly appointment. I'm already prescribed xanax and take about .5 to .75 mgs around 1-3 times a weeks. I've heard good things about Klonopin and that's much better than Xanax (As far as it being safer and the the effects lasting much longer). At my current dosage of Xanax it does cull my anxiety to abou 90%. I can get anxious if say I were to present something or a teacher is calling out random students to give inputs on the lecture or question at hand, not much a but a bit. It hasn't unfortunately helped me with socializing despite culling most of my anxiety. That's probably mostly my fault but I think it has to do a bit with the sedating effects of Xanax. I mostly feel like I don't really care about anything while I'm in class. Xanax also doesn't last very long fore me either. I'm not sure how different the effects of Klonopin are. And the reason why I added Adderall to this list is because I've heard from some people when they use it they don't necessarily feel high but want to socialize a lot. I'm not sure if this means it makes you just talk more without the anti-anxiety effects. Should I try upping Xanax to 1 mg/half a bar?

I've also heard some good things about Valium/Diazepam on the internet.

My first choice is probably to try Klonopin but I'm worried that it won't be as strong as Xanax despite having a longer half life. I feel like I need something as strong but with better effects.

17241,Psychedelics,Since two months.,"Hey guys, I wanna tell you what my experience on drugs is since the past two months! A couple of years ago I tried marijuana for the first two times and I never felt a thing(I inhaled right). Til one day I tried a 200mg brownie, I was desperate for the high I wanted(not really knowledgeable at the time) so I ate it all and fell asleep for 1.5 days. I stopped then started again two months ago. Since then I really got into drugs kinda. I tried DMT, two acid tabs, and also Xanax!! They were so nice.
When I tried DMT, I hit it from a rig and blew off into a new persons life. I lived the life of some person as their house was getting robbed while I was in the bathroom. It was the craziest shit.
For the acid, the first one doesn’t count because it was some fake garbage shit but the second one was amazing. I dropped it at 430 then watched hallucination videos for a bit, i thought it wasn’t working so I called up my friend. I got up and turned on the lights and started to talk to him. I was gone as I turned on the lights. The funny thing is I then watched this one girls Instagram live(goes to my school) for 3 fucking hours(going back and fourth off it). So I dropped another tab, I stayed in my room for a few hours then went to the metro parks with my bud and walked in the woods in the dark at like 930. We smoked some bud and the hallucinations started(wasn’t hallucinating before at all). It was an amazing feeling because I felt like a new me doing things I wouldn’t have done before because I then commented on a girls picture on Facebook! I wouldn’t have done that before. But anyways walking down the trail was amazing, I was playing ski mask and suicide boys. Playing those songs in that state was an amazing fucking feeling. I was so excited and happy dancing around! I was totally able to drive too!!
Xanax was really fucking nice also, i took one 2mg pill and walked to the bike path to meet my bud from the acid trip! It felt sooo amazing, something about it felt like a pure high. Just purity!! I got to the bike path and saw a guy get pulled over from a cop. I assumed where my friend was and I was like shit the cop pulled the person over right beside him.

17327,Advice/guidance,"3 week party binge didn’t lead to paranoia, but rather paranoia of paranoia?","TL;DR I am experiencing 0 psychotic or paranoid thoughts, but I am now unable to enjoy cannabis even because my mind always gets worried that I might.

Wall of text below




Hellloo to one of the friendliest communities on Reddit! I am reaching out for help because my situation is very specific and I’m distraught and not sure at this point who else to ask.

So starting the 23rd of December me and some of my close friends began what we didn’t know was about to be the craziest three weeks of our lives. Without going into detail between the 23rd of December and about the 14th of January I consumed approximately 3-4 grams of MDMA (fucking seriously just do not EVER heroic dose MDMA. It doesn’t make you cool it makes you a fucking idiot and leads to posting things like this on Reddit.) which includes a final comedown that involved a sober panic attack. Then a few days after my last MDMA night of the streak I had a 100ug acid trip (went great if that matters in this situation).

As a very experienced user I’m very aware of various comedowns and what to expect, however the day after my trip I smoked about a gram of cannabis and naturally started to trip again. I got extreme time distortion to the point of not being able to understand music or television because it was moving so fast. Once again I haven’t ever had any psychotic breaks or delusions however I felt extreme comeup anxiety due to not being even nearly ready to trip harder than the night before.

Now here is where my concerns come into play; every time I smoke weed now my mind almost reaches for any sort of trippy sensations or visuals and my highs go from literally feeling like a tired version of my sober self to nonstop worrying *hard* that I’m going to trip again, and it literally consumes me every single time. Now to be fair to my brain I put it through a lot and it is definitely still depleted of serotonin but I used to use weed to help with anxiety and “busy brain” and now I can’t because every single time I go near a headspace or thought process similar to harder psychedelics I have trouble discerning it from weed even though deep down I still know that I’m simply more aware of these head spaces, however even after my last trip it went away after this period of time. 

The bottom line is I’m honestly not sure what I want more between reassurance and a real piece of advice but I’m genuinely scared because while nothing is actually wrong I still have a *steady* fear that something will be even though I don’t even have a clue what that would be. Somebody please throw down some advice or even just let me know if you’ve experienced this or have anything at all to say!!

17329,LSD,I am on a lot of acid and have some thoughts on life and balls.,"Life is balls. Big, hairy enormous balls. Balls so unbelievably gargantuan that they cast shadows over mountains, glorious rippled skin folds looming above like hair-covered waves in the vast sea. The kind of balls so massive that their mere presence strikes a spear of respect deep within the hearts of awestruck observers, embalming their souls in the glory that is the balls. 

Impressive, towering balls; the sort that make weak men drop to their knees in surrender to the comprehension that all previous convictions are sacrilege. For these weak men know, the only truth is divinity found in understanding the sheer size and scale of the balls. 

The breadth of the balls is unobserved, only spoken of in debates of the foolish, seeking resolutions to unsolvable myths -- for the balls are so large, indeed, that they trigger the fear of incomprehension present in all men. A fear of endless profundity, a space only occupied by the void and God himself, that one lays awake at night questioning, tortured by the cognitive dissonance of knowing an answer will never be received, unable or unwilling to understand that the balls consume the void and God; mere two dimensional concepts when compared with the mere rigid mountainscape that is the folds in the balls. 

The balls are life. 

The balls are the universe.

Balls.

Ketamine is also shown to be effective in treatment resistant MDD. the stigma stops when you and the other 60 something yo followers of yours realise this ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ag67w1/nsw_premier_gladys_berejiklian_says_that_mdma_is/

  Everyone here is fucked up to some extent, they say happy people don't do drugs after all. But I like the analogy of a suicidal person talking down someone about to commit suicide, reminding them of how important life is. I often feel like people here care more than other people, purely because you know what kind of pain one needs to feel to turn to drugs. 

  This place doesn't just showcase one thing. This may be r/drugs, but people also post drug experiences, what led them to do drugs, things they've thought while on drugs, etc. When I go onto this subreddit I never know what I'll find, but I'll always find something good. 

  This place is *surprisingly* wholesome. Most everyone seems to try and help out and be friendly here. I've had people congratulate me for things as simple as not downvoting the person you're having a discussion with, and that feels really nice to be honest. People here also aren't as harsh on something they find strange, and are willing to give someone the benefit of the doubt. I've known someone who's ecstasy was cut with heroin, and that's really uncommon, but people here believe that I'm not lying.

17445,Stimulants,My hallucination-filled first brush with Psychosis (Adderall),"THERE WILL BE A TL:DR AT THE BOTTOM FOR ALL OF YOU DON’T WANT TO READ THE WHOLE POST, I tried to condense the main post as much as I could &lt;3 

I do not recommend doing any of what is outlined below, I learned from my mistakes. Please, do not try this, ESPECIALLY if you have a low/no tolerance with Adderall.

To start things off, my brother has a script for Adderall, 30mg XR. I’m a bigger lad, so if i’m taking addys I take 3 all at once.(90mg XR). While I’m high, I’ll usually do some pixel art (see most recent posts in history for the art I did while experiencing this story), or I just kind of do whatever. But whatever I end up doing, I do the shit out of it. I get VERY dedicated on Adderall. So, I wanted to draw this portrait of Mac Miller (175x175 pixels, it’s a decent-sized project), as he was one of my favourite artists and I was feeling particularly sad about his death.

I take 90mg XR at around 8pm on day 1, and start the picture. Nothing crazy, very typical Adderall high. I get 0 sleep, and I’m off to college the next morning. I finish class to find the save corrupted on the portrait. So, I lost around 9 hours straight of work. After calming down from my tantrum, I decide I’d need more addy to finish it. I was stubborn, and I was going to get this picture finished.

Now, I take my second dosage (another 90mg XR, totalling to 180 mg in less than 24 hours, for someone who uses addy maybe once every 3 months) at around 4pm. I restart the portrait, and things are going well. I notice some of the colours/lines seem to be swirling/bopping on my PC monitor, which happens to me after taking Adderall and not sleeping for a night. I also should add, I haven’t eaten at all for the past two days. As time goes on, the swirling and movement gets more and more frequent, and higher in intensity, to the point where I had never experienced visuals this intense on Adderall, or even shrooms for that matter. All pictures looked like GIFs, my hands looked nothing like my own pair, and everything was just... different. Not necessarily a bad trip at this point, though.

I continue on with the portrait, and I notice bizarre “creatures” moving around behind me through the reflection of the hard plastic on my PC monitor. I look behind me thinking it’s a family member who’s come into my room, but it’s nothing. This happens once or twice every 30 minutes, it’s quite annoying. The time is now around 9pm on day two. At around 1am that night, things get crazy. 

I hadn’t slept for 56 hours straight at that point, with nothing to eat, and the hallucinations were becoming more than just visuals. They carried a physical presence I could feel around me, not through touch. The details were too lifelike for me to just be imagining it. It all culminated when, while drawing, I see a large shadow displayed against the wall in front of me. The figure was standing behind me, and slowly coming closer, with each inch it moved, the shadow growing larger and larger. It was tall, had very broad shoulders, and was covered in fur. I could make out individual pieces of fur in the shadows, and since I couldn’t see the thing head on, I would say it’s shadow most closely resembled a bipedal werewolf. This hallucination/shadow was EXTREMELY detailed. The fear and anxiety I faced when confronted by this shadow is almost unmatched by any other experience in my life. Of course, I remind myself I’m just tripping hard, turn around, and all I find is a room that should be cleaned up more often. The creatures in my monitor’s reflection didn’t  stop, though, unless I was looking behind me. They continued to plague me through the night. My best description of them would be small beings made out of white vines, spiralled together to form limbs and a body (a mix between Groot from
Guardians of the Galaxy, and the antagonist creatures of The Spiderwick Chronicles). They seemed to have the malicious playfulness of a poltergeist.

These intrusions continued, and I started to feel like I was going insane, like I had developed full-blown psychosis. I feared my life would never be the same, and in that moment of self-diagnosis, I felt extreme guilt for my actions, anger at the situation, and tremendous disappointment in myself. I tried to sleep, but I couldn’t. And the mere thought of eating something made me feel nauseous. 

It wasn’t until the next morning, at 67 hours straight of being awake, I crashed on my bed. I slept for around 9 hours, which is a lot for me regardless of Adderall use. Upon waking up, I ate an ungodly amount of food, and felt an immense wave of relief, as all the symptoms of psychosis were gone. I did some research, and figured it was temporary Stimuli Psychosis caused by sleep deprivation and a high dose of Adderall on an empty stomach. 

I feel like I’ve learned a lot, though, as the hours in which I was experiencing psychosis were terrifying, both physically and mentally. I knew psychosis was a terrible thing to have to live with, but it’s hard to truly understand how it feels to be seeing/feeling/EXPERIENCING things you don’t want to, and not having control over anything. I hope it never happens again, I hope you all stay safe, and I hope if you do suffer from psychosis, you stay strong and keep living your best life. 

Much love.


TL:DR Took 90mg of Adderall, worked on a digital portrait, save was corrupted after 9 hours, decided to take another 90mg and restart. Then started to have increasingly disturbing, intrusive, and extremely vivid hallucinations as a result of sleep deprivation (being awake for 67 hours straight), a larger adderall dose (180mg in less than 24 hours for a low tolerance), and not eating for 2.5 days. Feared for my sanity, do not recommend. I’m okay now, though.

17447,Psychedelics,Recommend me something,"Here's my current experience with drugs

17 - got properly drunk for the first time, though it was pretty entertaining. Since then I've done alcohol occasionally but I don't really see the point in drinking ""a bit"" because it tastes like shit and it barely does anything in small quantities.

&amp;#x200B;

26 (about a year ago) - Weed. learned to smoke it properly and liked it a lot. researched a bit and turns out that vaping is way more efficient. Tried that and now I love weed .

&amp;#x200B;

New Year's Eve (90ug LSD with GF as trip sitter) - 90ug of LSD and weed on the comedown. Holy shit man. Half a tab of LSD was the most powerful thing I have ever experienced. Not in the sense that I was almost passing out (happened a few times with alcohol) but in a sense that I was experiencing everything in a totally different way.

&amp;#x200B;

LSD has also made me realise that I have been using weed wrongly. I am now trying to cut back on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Last weekend (MDMA solo roll) This was amazing as well but I solo rolled and just listened to music at home so I don't think I've seen the full potential of MDMA yet.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I try next? I was thinking **2C-B** but i'm open to suggestions. I won't trust myself with opioids or stims though. Risk of addiction seems very high.

17478,Diazepam,Valium addiction?,"Hey guys,

Long time lurker and fellow drug user but had to sign up to get some advice/help because this sub is the only place I will be able to get this type of help. I'll try make it short, but I'll include a tldr at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

A family member of mine has suffered through depression/anxiety for about two years now, along with some serious pain from an injury. He is prescribed valium to help him sleep, but I think he might be struggling with an addiction and lying about his use. He never really experimented with drugs, but we are both really open about it. He knows about my weed smoking and occasional mdma/psych use, and he has told me about his experimentation, so I don't really think he would lie to me. I've read about benzos but never used them so that's why I need some help.

&amp;#x200B;

He's fine most of the time, but sometimes (usually at night, a few hours after getting home from work, although it's been happening more lately) he will enter this 'mode' where he will talk really slowly, slur his words, just be out of it. He will close his eyes and sort of sleep even if he is standing up talking to people. If he's standing he is quite wonky and off balance. He uses the excuse that he is tired which I've always thought was bullshit but only recently did I really think, yeah he's probably taken some valium and that's why he is in that mood.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to him about it and he went from saying that he doesn't take it often to saying he takes about 8mg 4x a week to sleep. The thing is, the next morning he is usually still in that mode. Is this normal? I'm thinking maybe if he takes them at night the lingering effects could still cause him to be like that the next day? I said to him I think he is addicted and he denies that, and as I said before I don't really think he would lie to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what I'm asking here. I don't really even fully know if this is the effect of him taking valium, it could be something unrelated (he doesn't each much food or get much exercise, plus suffers from depression). If he is taking it that often and in such a state where he is literally closing his eyes as he talks to you, could it be addiction? How do I help him with it if he keeps denying that he is addicted?

&amp;#x200B;

Last thing to add which is important is I found a paper on his desk about addiction from a doctor or psychologist. He had written something about withdrawal on day 3, and how he thinks about how he can't sleep and that his anxiety is starting, and that if he just takes one (didn't mention what drug) it will be all good and he will be able to sleep. I guess this confirms the suspicions, but I think I'm in denial and can't really fathom it?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated, will answer any questions to help too. Thanks a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - brother occasionally enters a mood where he slurs his words, talks differently, really slowly, forgets things, closes his eyes/starts falling asleep even standing up, is prescribed valium, says takes it 4x a week and I'm thinking it's now an addiction. Any advice?

17514,I :love: Drugs,The time I overdosed while eating pussy.,"It was summer 2018 when I flew to Miami Florida for a friend of mines bachelor party. He rented this huge house for the full weekend filled with every liquor imaginable &amp; all of our drug dealer friends. The night before we checked into the house we thought it would be a good idea to have a night of our own. Just me , 2 of my bros &amp; our female stripper friend. We got so drunk off of sailor jerry we said fuck everything. We went to a strip club that night and did so much cocaine I fell in love with every stripper that walked pass me. I nearly emptied out my entire bank account and let it fly. Near the end of the night I had remembered I brought some acid with me from home and thought we should do it. Disclaimer: don’t do acid at 4 am and think your next day will be fine. That acid trip was the beginning of the longest 3 days in my life.

The next day with no sleep we all moved like zombies trying to get everything ready for the 20 other people coming to celebrate with us the next three days. I couldn’t even think about sobering up. I hadn’t slept. My soon to be married friend suggested molly would help.... fucking wrong. I took it anyway. Coming down from the acid mixed with the cocaine and the molly put me in a cynical state. I couldn’t feel anything. I could barely talk. I wasn’t belligerent. I was perfectly aware of everything going on around me but I just couldn’t indulge. I put my hood over my head and pulled the drawstrings as tight as I could covering my mouth and everything except my eyes , I responded to everything by nodding my head yes or no. I got so high I had turned into Kenny McCormick. 

I was offered more and more coke and I took it only in hopes to feel normal again. Didn’t work. I thought maybe more drinking. I drank every kind of alcohol you could think of.... didn’t work. I still felt numb. Finally I gave up on everything and asked for more molly. I was given 8 capsules. I took them all in 15 min intervals. Still nothing. After 3 days of strip clubs and more drinking the stripper friend from the first night thought I needed help in her way. She got us a hotel room. She thought pussy could bring me back to life. I did too. 

I had secretly shit blood earlier that day but thought nothing of it. More cocaine I say! Me and the girl start messing around in the hotel room. Both naked we give each other oral sex. I start eating her out and I spit on her clit and noticed on the white bed sheets it was a blood stain. I wiped it and realized it was fresh blood. I asked her “what the fuck are you on your period?” She sat up quick and said “no I just got off my period” so I’m like fuck it, no worries. We start fucking, I turn her over doggy style and fucking her from behind. I start getting a weird and crippling pain in my stomach and my heart. I ignore it to keep fucking. I pull my dick out to spit on her pussy for lubrication. When I spit on her pussy I realize it was me bleeding out my mouth. I freaked out. My heart started racing and I started coughing. I told her and ran to the bathroom. 

I started coughing up blood in the sink for about 30 min. My heart is pounding out my chest &amp; my stomach feels like I’m digesting razor blades. I shit more blood while coughing up blood in the bath tub. I finish up and clean everything. I get back into bed with her and she comforts me. Gives me water, massages me for a while and then finally whispers in my ear “I want to keep fucking” in my head I’m like “bitch I’m dying” but instead of saying that guess what I did! I fucked the shit out of her.... I was thinking “ay man if my hearts stops in this pussy is the best place to be.” I make her cum and roll over on my stomach in agony. 

While trying to sleep I realized that I might have finally reached my limit. Mixing different alcohols acid cocaine and molly for 3 days straight might have finally did the trick. I’m not a doctor but the way I felt I thought to myself I’m definitely not waking up tomorrow. In that same thought I deleted all the dick pics , sex tapes &amp; embarrassing pictures out my phone and texted everyone I loved my last words. Went to sleep like a baby. Next day I literally woke up surprised to be alive and thought to myself “you lucky fuck” I packed my shit and flew back home that same day and never even went to a doctor.

17605,Psychedelics,1P-LSD Advice and Safe Use,"**Hello there!**

This post is regarding some questions about 1P-LSD i wanted to ask in this subreddit since i couldnt find all the answers myself and some personal advice of experienced Users might be helpful. 

So i plan on taking 1P-LSD within the next few months and i am still not quite sure about some things. 

I've never had any experiences with psychedelics before; the only other drugs that i tried so far are Alcohol, Cannabis and DXM (in this order), with Cannabis having sort of psychedelic effects on me. 

**How much should i take?** 

I want to use 1P-LSD responsible and safe, minimizing the risk of bad effects, but at the same time experience the hallucinations, colors and feelings LSD can give you. What would be a right dose to start of with? 

My personal guess would be to start with one tab of around 100-120 ug, but i really have no clue if this is too strong or too weak, since my lack of personal experience. I am very prone to the effects of cannabis, meaning i dont need much to get high on cannabis. But i've never had a really bad experience on cannabis and if my thoughts went dark, i was able to handle my mindset pretty good and get back to a good train of thoughts. I was also able to help other people through tough trips, while being stoned af. Does this translate over to LSD? I am also of course going to have a trip sitter with me, although not being experienced with drugs himself, being someone i can trust.

**How do i test 1P-LSD?**

I think i am going to buy the 1P-LSD from a reliable source, but i want to be really sure, that what i get is not just some dangerous RC. I read that 1P-LSD is particullary hard to test and the ehrlich test doesnt really show any effect on it. Is there any way to test 1P-LSD and if so, which way would it be? 

**What are your suggestions on what to do while being on LSD?** 

Since the effects of (1P) LSD can last fairly long with up to 12-14 hours, what would you suggest to do? I dont want to just sit around and play games, i wanna do and experience something to see the true colors of LSD. Recommend anything you like to do while being on LSD or on psychs in general, music recommendations are also appreciated. Is it bad to go out in rainy weather? 

**If you have any other advice or recommendations, be sure to tell me, everything is appreciated!** 

I think this post is not just going to help me but is also going to help many other people thinking about taking LSD for their first time. Thank you for reading and have a nice day! 

**If i forgot anything important tell me**

I took about 1.5 tabs of 25I-NBOMe with my cousin and spent the night tripping together. What I didn't expect was the drug to help me relax about issues that were causing me stress.

Here's the deal, I had a pretty bad break-up a couple months, the type that's based on constant fighting and ends leaving a pretty ugly scar on you, and for awhile after I felt unlovable and doomed to spend the rest of my life in pure solitude. Then I took the 25I. The trip, for some time, gave me a sort of out of body experience, where I seemed to be looking down upon those recent negative events from something that felt like a ""God"" perspective, I was seeing it all happening from a bystander perspective, but also as if I were an omniscient presence (those of you who like literature should get what this means). Idk how else to describe it.

By having me see everything from that perspective, it helped me realize that non of it really is a big deal and that the world's so big I can continue my life like nothing had happened before. I'm not saying it completely cured me but it definitely helped me move forwards in my mental health.

17685,Psychedelics,First time DMT trip report,"Hey guys I've been a lurker here for a while but haven't really posted much. Yesterday I tried DMT for the first time and I feel like I need to talk about it/document the experience. A little of my drug background: regular cannabis user, salvia was the first drug besides weed/alcohol that i ever tried, that was about 3-4 years ago and this past year, due to some wild life events, I really got into psychedelics (LSD specifically) and have done that 5 times over the past 10 months. I've always been curious about DMT and I recently got the chance to try it so I figured I'd just dive in. 

So my friend had a DMT extract in a vape pen (apparently this isn't the preferred method, but I had a strong and profound experience nonetheless) I couldn't give you the exact dosage, but I trusted him that I wouldn't be getting anything weird/dangerous. So I meditated for a bit, prepared myself mentally, and laid back on the couch to take the first hit. I inhale, hold it for a few seconds, and exhale. I feel a bit weird, but still lucid. I take the second hit. I can feel myself gearing up. The colors in the room became a lot more contrasted, I got this 'crackly' type of feeling throughout my entire body. The third hit, I inhaled as much as I could, held it for as long as I could, and exhaled. My friend handed me a bottle of water, I took a sip and felt the water go through my entire body, like I had 4 different stomachs. I heard my friend say I could take another hit if I wanted, but all the will left my body and I essentially became dead weight.

I heard the buzz of the AC get louder, like it was coming from inside me. Then it got higher and louder while my entire visual field was encompassed by swirling red and green lights. I was smacked in the face with this strong feeling of deja vu, or nostalgia, or familiarity. My friend told me the first thing I said was ""I've been here before"". This is the most intriguing part to me because even now I can remember that feeling, like coming back to a childhood home but much stronger. I could feel myself riding this sound wave through something, like it was carrying me upwards. And then the AC cut off and I was dropped back onto the couch. 

I opened my eyes but I'll admit, I didn't get much visuals. Or if I did, I couldn't retain the memory because there was so much else going on. The room was growing brighter and dimmer and everything looked sharper, almost acid-like but nothing too crazy. I still was glued to the couch and opening my eyes took so much energy I just kept them closed. I heard the rain falling outside, and it felt like it was surrounding me, coming from inside of me. It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever heard while flashes of red played in my mind. Throughout this entire experience I'm feeling the deepest love and warmth I'd ever felt. It felt like I was in between this pure love that the DMT brought me into and the real world which brought confusion. It was the easiest decision I ever had to make. I fully enveloped myself in love and positivity. By this point I'd regained some control over my body and I was just hugging myself, the couch, and overall being overwhelmed by emotion. I started laughing uncontrollably and then just as quickly as it began, it was over. I realize I probably didn't have a breakthrough as I didn't see entities or fully go through to the other dimension the way many here report. But it was a deeply interesting and profound experience. I felt a bit tired afterwards, but not exhausted. I just felt so much warmth and love, like God himself had just given me a hug and that feeling lasted the rest of the night.

17719,Alprazolam,Vivid hallucinations on Xanax?,"(A lot more happened this day but this is all I remember)

So this all started yesterday when at around 12 o’clock I dropped half a bar and an hour later I took another half, I did this until in total I had taken 4 full 3mg bars of Xanax.

I then met up with my mate and we picked some weed, I near enough smoked a whole gram and 2 hours later I threw up a lot, I then remembered having very very vivid hallucinations where I could see copies of my mate alongside him and I could see people walking around all over the place.

 Bear in mind that am a quite heavy weed smoker and I had not done Xanax for over 2 months before this and hadn’t done any other drug except weed since the new year, also all of this was done on an empty stomach and on no sleep.

17725,LSD,Acid &amp; Mental health help needed.,"I've had on going issues with mental health for all of my adult life, never been hospitalised, but i've needed the meds, i've done the counselling etc. I came off my meds about 7 months ago and have been the better side of hit and miss up until recently.  


I had somewhat of an incident whilst I was out about a week ago which ended up in my head being in a spin in some really bad places. It was a really intense 2 hours then I managed to calm myself down.  


5 years ago I used to do way too much acid, I worked out where my tolerance threshold was and pretty much ended up doing it every week or every other week, I seemed to have a low tolerance which reset pretty fast. I got into a habit of it until things started getting weird when I was sober.  


Since my incident last week i've felt like i've been on a microdose or something when I haven't touched any for a long time, i've heard of HPPD, flashbacks etc but i've also read they don't last long. All the colours seem really vivid, I feel a little disassociated and have feelings of derealisation.   


I'm aware there isn't any type of quick fix for this, on top of this the two might not even be related, I was just wondering if anybody else has had any experiences similar and how they learned to either live with them or anything else which might have helped.

The first time I did it I was just with one other person (my close friend) in a nature preserve near Malibu. It was really desolate with an ocean view, deep in nature, and a inherently very calming environment.

Now I live in New York which is essentially the opposite of where I first did acid lol. A huge metro area with parks that are always littered with other people and a city that is very loud, bustling, and for me personally, anxiety inducing while intoxicated on psychoactive drugs. 


Do any of you have experience doing psychedelics in a large city such as new york without desolate places? If so, what did you do, who did you do it with, and what was your experience like?

17746,Shmoke ,How risky is it to trade my mushrooms for marijuana?,"6 months ago I got into monotub growing. I had a few PF Tek grows under me but I didn't realize how much a monotub would net me. I had like 4.6 ounces of dried cubes from one tub! I had no use for them as I was more interested in growing than tripping 24/7 so I found someone to trade marijuana with. Our setup is pretty nice, we do an even 1:1 trade on ounces. I feel like, obviously, I get the better end of the bargain so I always throw him a half ounce or so for free. He sells out while I grow another batch and we repeat.

It works for me because I can still get a trip in every grow and have basically all the weed I could smoke but my biggest worry is getting caught. I think I'm getting too comfortable with it because it's not ""selling"" but it's...basically selling...

I love growing mushrooms but I can't just have pounds of mushrooms laying around and I don't want to be a drug dealer so I thought this was a perfect middle ground. I just don't know if I should continue or not. Yes, I get the better deal when it comes to dollars but my side is more risky than his side when it comes to jail time.

&amp;#x200B;

00:00 150mg of dmt consumed.

&amp;#x200B;

0:15 I put on some music and focused on breathing.

&amp;#x200B;

0:25 Effects started to manifest and I got a very strong head rush and a warm buzz that I felt all over my entire body. Colors became more saturated. Everything looked more clear like all the air from the room was sucked out

&amp;#x200B;

0:35 I had to go and vomit, at this time the effects of the trip were becoming stronger and stronger. Closed eye visuals very were apparent. They were similar to the closed eye visuals I saw on 4 grams of shrooms. At this was very dizzy and light headed but I could still walk and function normally. At this time I started to get a lot of anxiety about the trip so I put on some music and started to focus on breathing. 

&amp;#x200B;

0:50 At this point time became irrelevant to me. I felt like I was being pulled into something. I felt as if I was going below my bed. At this point, the open eye visuals were too overwhelming my entire room was breathing and I thought there was someone in the room when I was alone at the time. My entire room was ""decorated"" into what you would usually see during a DMT breakthrough. The room's walls were going in and out of reality I could see beyond the walls into some kind of ""void""

&amp;#x200B;

0:50-2:30 Because time was very dilated to the point where it didn't matter I can't really put timestamps in this. I felt like I was going faster and faster and I felt that my body was falling apart I completely lost control of my arms and legs. I could only move my head. Open eye visuals were too intense for me to look at soi had to close my eyes. When I closed my eyes I thought I was in a tunnel going faster and faster toward a white light. The tunnel was made out of red and purple dimly lit geometric patterns. The tunnel smelled like a jungle and the bottom of my body felt wet. When I entered the white light I teleported into an oval room with a table in the middle. I felt that I could move my body with my thoughts so I got on the table. When I did that I instantly got very confused. I was teleported into my own room but this time I saw my body I was holding something that looked like a gun, my head was blown out. After I saw this I felt I was being pulled into something again. I was pulled into my best friends room where I saw him crying, he was sprawled out on his bed, it looked like he was in a lot of pain. I couldn't leave the room the more I wanted to leave the more detailed the scene became. This hurt me a lot I really wanted to help him but I couldn't do anything, this made me very sad. After about what felt like a day I felt I was being pulled into something again. I have pulled into a tunnel again it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life, I was surrounded by light entities and I was being carried by snakes through the tunnel. I felt loved by everything, I was so happy, I was in the most euphoria I ever experienced. At the end of the tunnel, there was a very large oval room that kept expanding there was an entity that was expanding the room. I thought that that entity was a god. I asked it if it was god it said yes. The entity was humanoid with a pyramid on the head it was glowing. It then said one day you will be here. I said I'm happy to hear it. The entity said it loved me and then I was pulled back into my room in an instant.

&amp;#x200B;

2:34 When I came back I checked my phone this was the time. Moving was really hard and the visuals were similar to what I experienced on 500ug. Moving was really hard I felt that my body felt really weird.

17931,Long Post,I’m taking the money my grandmother left me out of the bank.,"  

This morning I’m supposed to meet Sal’s guy.

He said 10 last night, so I’m up early. Do a shot. Smoke a cigarette and run to the bank. This is me going all in. I’m taking the money my grandmother left me out of the bank. When there’s something I know I shouldn’t do and don’t actually want to do, when I’m about to be stupid, my mind does this thing where it just goes blank. Like, it knows how to walk me to the ATM outside of my bank. My brain remembers the pin number and how to operate the screen. It tells my feet how to get back to the motel, but it doesn’t think about what’s really going on. My mind somehow pushes out the painful reality, the sickening thought of going back on my grandmother’s will for me and the money she left me. It was sort of a joke when I told you that she didn’t want me to spend it. I mean. That was a slight exaggeration, but she’d throw a fit if she knew I was about to take that 8000 dollars and use it to buy a major amount of heroin. I am coming up today. Today changes everything.

As I get back to the room and walk through the parking lot, there’s no movement. No body outside. No cars running. It’s just silent and dismal under the sunless sky, like time’s inertia got frozen still somehow and stuck in the grey crystal of this moment, because outside of the trap motel, outside of every trap motel all across America, it’s always the same. Hard. Miserable, and everyone is looking to come up. 

Well, I got mine. I’m holding that huge wad of bills in my hand inside of my pocket as I get back to the room. There’s this sign on the door, though. It’s taped up and the words are scrawled onto it pretty poorly. It reads:

 Hey Dill Hole,

We know what you been doing. Stop it. Or we’ll get you.  

At least they capitalized the D and H. I tell myself. My guess is that middle schoolers wrote it is because I can’t think of anyone who would ever address someone as dill hole that wasn’t in 6th grade. You know? No respectable adult uses the word dillhole. Not even a self-respecting 14-year-old would use that word. 

All the same, it causes me anxiety. I don’t really know what the letter’s about, but I am doing all kinds of bad things. People are getting hurt. I think of Beth and her daughter. That meth I did the other day has my mind all bent up still. There’s the dirty gun under my bed. Paranoia is lingering, as I open the door and walk into the room. 

My intentions haven’t changed, though. I’m still going to buy a lot of heroin. Sal is taking me to meet his man in a bit, and while I wait, I open my old bookbag and go through it to pass the time. The zippered mouth breathes out a dirty latex smell. An old notebook comes out of it which I open to find a list of concepts and book titles I was coming up with all those years ago. The list goes like this:

The Laundromat

Put the Hot Dog Down, You’re Under Arrest!

You Say Banana, I Say Bananee

Tucking My Hernia in like a Shirttail

Not sure what I was thinking on those titles but oh well. There’s also a grey balled up sock in there and an old gardening glove under a few pages of a letter addressed to my grandma. The letter has some red pencil sketches this old artist guy did of me in New Mexico. I got the drawings after she died. She’d kept them up on her refrigerator for years while I was using. The written part said that I was a nice young man and that he, the old artist who wrote the letter and drew the pictures, had heard about how my grandmother was sending me a sleeping bag. He felt moved to do a few of my portraits and send them to her as thanks, because I didn’t have anything to send her. The letter makes me laugh because it’s not true. I wasn’t a nice or a young man. I was a stupid kid.  

Anyway, I crumple the paper in my hands and toss it into the trashcan by the door. Maybe I should keep it but don’t. She’s gone. The money’s going. There’s no point in keeping things that will just remind me of what I don’t have anymore. I put my hands behind my head and lie back waiting for Sal and Beth. There hasn’t been much time for me to tell stories to myself like I usually do, so I take the opportunity to light a cigarette and make one up. I call it The Chicken Boy. 

The Chicken Boy was born to an old farmer in the middle of nowhere, Oklahoma. His mother died during child birth. Her widowed husband did the best he knew how, teaching the boy how to tend to farm work, the garden, the crops, the cattle, the pigs, and the chickens, which is when the boy realizes that he’s actually a chicken in a boy’s body. Years pass with nothing happening, until one day the father has a crisis on his hands. The boy is listening to Shaggy. He has a poster of the dreadlocked pop star on the wall above his bed. They go to counseling, but nothing can help the man figure out what’s wrong with his son, why he’s listening to Shaggy. It’s so hard for the old man to take. 

This story makes me laugh pretty good, you know, like your son listening to Shaggy is a crisis, but anyway, now the boy’s moved onto dancing around the house at night dressed in a chicken suit. Eventually, the father and son have it out. The boy screams at his father, 

“I’m just a Chicken Boy, dad! Can’t you see that? I just wanna do Chicken Boy things! What’s so wrong with that?” 

This whole bit about wanting to do chicken boy things really makes me laugh out loud on the bed there. Where does this come from? I’m actually talking to myself, saying the things the kid says to his dad, having their conversation with myself. Anyway, his father punches him in the face, and the boy moves out west, where he can run around and be the chicken he’s always wanted to be, the chicken he’s always been. Finally and unfortunately, a geriatric landowner on the coast shoots him one day and kills him. It’s a mistake. He thought he was a wild turkey, and the story ends when the already brokenhearted father finds out about his son’s death. The news crushes him. Chicken Boy’s poor old man bawls on the wooden floor of the ranch house. A very dramatic ending.

I sit up on the bed and talk out loud into the room. It’s dark but for the blue luminescence of early morning light coming through the windows and the bathroom light through the cracked door. I talk to myself, saying that the hard and heavy ending might justify the ridiculousness of the whole Chicken Boy bit. Maybe, there’s something to that, juxtaposing such absurd humor against such hard hitting sadness so that it is senseless, the way life usually is, and just like that, a horn is honking outside of my room.

METH IS NOT BAD. CHANGE MY MIND.

When Jessica first saw her boyfriend using meth, her reaction was to storm out of the house in a fury, even though she was currently using heroin. After Oscar shot meth into his penis, he needed medical attention, but he lied and said he'd injected cocaine, because he ""didn't dare admit to using meth."" He had no trouble admitting that he stuck a needle full of drugs into his wang, which is generally a thing a person should have a problem with.

17963,I :love: Drugs,Way too much at once (Ego death?)," Amateur drug enthusiast here. Will dabble in anything that isn’t needles or hardcore. Have only smoked weed and dabs in the past half year due to reasons. Last night I decided to hang out with some friends and go back into the love of drugs. I wasn’t expecting much except shrooms and weed and some hash oil, but when I got there fuck did I realize I had messed up. Walked in and there’s a big ass sack of coke sitting on the table and weed and shrooms right beside it. 

Drug Addicts by Pump was on and he has lights that correspond with his speakers which are badass. Friend is in in the kitchen making canna butter. So we talked and caught up. Flash forward about a hour and a blunt or two later the cannabutter was in the fridge and we had finally relaxed and I was already about 2 and a half beers in and shit went wild. Didn’t take about 30 minutes after we had sat down and started drinking that we had broke out the coke and I did 3 lines immediately. Washed coke, good shit, not a bad come down. 2 more lines and I decided to do some shrooms. 6 grams I’d say gobbled it down nastiest shit ever but I champed it. Looked to my left and realized the girl I brought with me was scared out of her mind (she’s a little quiet girl and all my friends are loud and ghetto) and I realized she has never even seen coke before. So I had to baby her into her first credit card bump which she impressively decided to try a whole line which is again of some good shit. I had to convince her the shrooms were okay to eat and ate about 4 more grams in the process because she wanted me to eat them with her. About 15 minutes later I’m thinking what a bad idea this is. Coke and shrooms? Some things aren’t meant to be mixed. 

But I was too far gone and we had started smoking some blunts and finally I started to get some visuals. Corners sharpening, colors getting brighter, the tv was playing Sicko mode at the time and the colors were startling. My friend has loud ass speakers too so my feet were vibrating, had to look away and focus on smoking so as to not stare at the tv. I ended up closing my eyes and the colors startled me even more. Brilliant lights, colors, patterns, I had never seen something like that. And I’ve done shrooms before and DMT, all of it. I have never experienced such brilliant lights. They got too bright and I had to open my eyes and I guess it had to have been almost 20 minutes my friend I had brought had pressed herself into me and closed her eyes because she was having a bad trip and flipping out. I was able to talk her through it because I’ve trip sitted before and I wasn’t too far gone to help somebody, had to make her realize everything around her isn’t real and that she’ll be fine. 

So she went back into having a good mind and my friend came back, he went out to grab some codeine and other stuff from our guy. My friend who I’ll call Q (fat and funny motherfucker) starts joking around saying I don’t look far gone enough and that he had promised me a good night. I didn’t realize what he was saying and just agreed with him and he stepped in front of me and my friend and he bent over right in my face with this big shit eating smile, and told me to open my mouth. My dumb ass actually did it. He squirted acid into my mouth. A good bit was in that dropper the very least 1000 ug. I felt it dripping down the back of my throat. I could even taste that shit. I wasn’t even mad. I was just scared. I didn’t know what to do I was afraid I was going to trip way to hard and I heard that doing coke and drinking helps get rid of that. Poured me a bottle and mixed it with some sprite and some ice and jolly ranchers and the jolly ranchers looked like crystals falling into the cup. Did 2 more lines and used my friends shooter once, chugged a beer. After we started back on the blunts that’s when the severity of it all hit me. 

I realized I was on a ride that’s brakes had broken and I was on a mountain going down. My friend who I brought with me had also did another line of coke and she was rolling a blunt and when she said my name that’s when it all hit me at once like a fucking train. She said my name to pass me the blunt and it was like a alien had spoken inside my mind it was a completely foreign and scary language. I turned my head slowly to look at her like in a shitty horror movie and when I looked at her she was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. 

Not like the most beautiful woman, I don’t know how to explain it. The most beautiful thing. She didn’t even look human she looked completely alien and everything around me was so different. It was like I was in a completely alternate reality. I’ve done DMT, Peyote, a lot of fucking psychedelics and I have never experienced something like that. She was so bright and her eyes were like universes and I could see inside of them, her cheeks were lava red and on fire, and it was just terrifying. At this point I was completely detached from my reality. I forgot none of this was real I forgot I was tripping I forgot about my life and only could stare at this beautiful thing trying to communicate with me.From there all I remember is taking the blunt, hitting it, leaning back, and closing my eyes to watch the lights and listen to a mix of Kendrick Lamar, Mac Miller, Glass Animals, Logic, and school boy Q. 

I closed my eyes but I was awake the whole time. I just couldn’t move for some reason but I wasnt afraid at all. During my peaking hours I knew I was safe and it was like I felt everything melt away, the music was vibrating my entire soul. The songs will forever be different. I started realizing that life doesn’t matter that all my problems aren’t worth the stress and that they mean absolutely nothing after this. I was in pure euphoria I felt just lifted. When I started being able to open my eyes I realized someone had picked me up and laid me on the couch (I assume Q because my other friend is too small and also tripping) and my friend was asleep beside me. Q went to bed. I had my eyes closed for over 9 hours at this point and I think it was 5 or 6 in the morning. Its so imprinted in my mind opening my eyes and Poetic Justice was on and it was the Chorus was on. I was so relaxed I couldn’t even move I could barely even use my arms to get comfortable. I was still peaking just able to keep my eyes open. I felt so happy to be alive, to know my existence is more and that there is more in this world and that I shouldn’t be afraid of the future because it’s useless. I really learned some things and accepted everything that’s happened and ever will happen. 

I had never felt so spiritually woken up. I peaked for literally over 15 hours. I started at about 9:30 PM, peaked around 12, and was able to go to the bathroom at around 2 PM. Still had visuals. Still was so happy. Came out of the bathroom and Q was snorting some lines and drinking a corona, I hugged the fat mother fucker and did a fat line and toasted to us. I woke my friend up and hugged her and thanked her for being the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. She had also gotten past some barriers in her life and was crying from happiness. We ate breakfast, done some more lines, and microdosed. My friend was too fucked to drive so I reluctantly had to drive her Prius. It wasn’t hard but it was very hard to keep attention the road everything around me was so beautiful and bright,  I had to convince myself I had to stay within my yellow line or we would lose as if it’s a video game, was able to get us to Walmart. Come Through and Chill was on the whole time it seems. Now we’re at Walmart eating subway. Still seeing things, I feel like I’ll see this stuff forever and it’s really made my life a lot better. My friend ship has amplified greatly with Q and my other friend too, she seems completely changed from her experience in a good way too. I’m glad there’s somewhere I can share my experiences and still remain anonymous. The next thing I’ll be glad for is when these visuals go away, I’m not peaking anymore but I am very slowly coming down. I don’t know if I’ll be able to ever beat this psychedelic experience, but I can sure try. I think I had an ego death. To be honest. 
I’d love to hear others stories of them going way too far into the world of psychedelics. Until next time. ",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/agez3p/way_too_much_at_once_ego_death/
17985,Antidepressants,Trazadone (for sleep) causing disassociation next day?,"I was just yesterday prescribed 25 mg a night (half a tablet) to help me with insomnia.

18002,Stimulants,Feeling consistently irritated from going cold turkey from meth for a day.,"I’ve been doing around 3-5 key bumps a day for the last 2 months, Yesterday I did 6 bumps and as a personal rule, I decided to go a whole day without it and I’ve never wanted to start a fight with someone so badly. I don’t even know why I feel so confident that I could even win one. I’m a 5’2, 113-pound 30-year-old woman who regularly gets mistaken for a high school student.

Before this night i had only dropped ecstasy a couple times but i was a experienced mandy roller so i didn't think much of the pill but oh was i in for a shock.. about an hour after ingesting the pill i started to notice the effects as you'd expect jaw clenching and extreme euphoria, comparable to a moderate molly dose so far. Although it is a blur, i can vividly remember being drenched in sweat to the point it looked like i had just got out of a hot shower and my fellow gurners made sure to tell me. As i was looking around at their faces, the most realistic set of four eyes was present on everyones face and it was that vivid i couldn't tell it from reality. In a mix of shock and awe i just stared at them and sure enough the eyes stayed perfectly as they were in a neat row from side to side, blinking and all.

18132,Cannabinoids,Concerned about marijuana use," 

I  am a 23 year old male, currently working as a teacher.  I have some  traits of mild aspergers, including specific interests, extreme  knowledge of certain topics (this is partially why I became a science  teacher) and some social difficulties.

I  have been teaching for about half a year.  Recently, I have begun  smoking (and more recently vaping) weed almost every day after work.  I  am worried about the effects this could have on my health or my psyche,  and I am afraid I may be using it as an escape.  My life has been hard  lately.  I lost a sibling a year and a half ago, and I am still  grieving.  I am living far from home, across the country from where I  was born, with no family for thousands of miles.  The only friend I have  is my roommate.  I have been overloaded with the dreaded  first-semester-of-teaching until very recently, so I haven't had much of  a life outside of teaching.  I love weed, but don't want my weed use to  become a vice, and given how unstable my life has been.

The  reason I use it so much is because it helps me put things in  perspective.  Sometimes I get stuck on negative thoughts especially as a  teacher.  I have nasty social anxiety, and that makes teaching super  stressful.  The stresses of my job follow me home and get in my head -  when I get high, these things seem to immediately fall into perspective,  and they don't bother my anymore, even after I sober up.   I have also  been trying to put my life together, and weed seems to help.  I have  lived my life thus far with bad hygienic, sleep, and exercise habits.  I  have tried to change this in the past, but gave up quickly.  When I get  high, these things suddenly seem so much more important to me.  I have  been doing daily pushups and guitar practice for over a month now, and  weed seems to have streamlined the process, or at least made it more  enjoyable.

I  am concerned that I may be depending on weed to do these things, but at  the same time, I'm not happy with my life right now, and until my  year-long contract ends, I'm stuck with a job and a lifestyle that I  don't particularly like.  I love the act of teaching, and I love my  students.  I have so much fun showing them science - I'm told I'm really  good at showmanship and making my lessons exciting, and the majority of  my kids seem to love it.  Even the high stress, high workload aspect of  teaching isn't really what bothers me though - I'm willing to push  through stress and fear if it's for something worthwhile.  It's just  that I'm not meeting people, and not really doing much besides teaching.   I am surrounded by other teachers who are older, and almost all  married with kids.  I'm not among peers, and that won't change as long  as I'm teaching here.  I smoke so much because it gives me something to  live for - my hobbies are so much more enjoyable, I'm exercising, and  developing instrumental skills.  It's almost meditative.  I just worry  that I may be missing something by constantly reverting to marijuana use  for my fun, instead of...  I guess I don't really know what.  I have no  direction or purpose in life right now.

I  am sorry for rambling, I got a bit off topic.  This whole thing was  written start to finish in one go, so it's a bit stream of  consciousness, but if you'd indulge me, I could really use some advice,  or at least some input.

18147,Stimulants,Long-term Adderall &amp; Caffeine usage.. How much cardiac damage given my lifestyle?,"Greetings,

I need an opinion from all you drug experts.  I was wondering if one would suspect cardiac damage to be present due to long-term usage of Adderall and caffeine given the following lifestyle:

I take 20mg of IR Adderall + 400mg of caffeine 5 times a week. I am 135lbs &amp; 5'7.  I do aerobic exercise approximately 3 times per week, which usually consists of a 3 mile light jog.  I have an insane amount of endurance, regardless of how much exercise I have done (I could probably run a half marathon after not working out for 3 weeks).  I never work out while under the influence of stimulants, as I think this defeats the purpose and can't be good for your health.  I am a pretty conscious eater; I don't eat fast food, eat 3 light meals per day, and try to be as healthy as possible (but sometimes this isn't feasible being a broke graduate student).  I don't drink or smoke nicotine.  I smoke flowered bud a couple times a week, but only usually a couple hits.  I take 1mg of clonazopam nightly, and use kratom 3-4 times a week.  My level of stress compared to the normal population is probably slightly less than average (3/10?).  I try to meditate every night.

&amp;#x200B;

Given this description, what is the probability that I will have cardiac damage after using this amount of Adderall and caffeine?  My cardiac health is the main thing I am currently concerned about in my life, but due to the demands of life and how much stimulants help me, I do not see a foreseeable future as to when the stimulant usage will stop.

18164,Psychedelics,3 doses of LSD freak out,"This happened on December 28, 2018. Me and my older brother (19 and 23) were home alone for the weekend and his long time friend ‘M’ hit him up letting him know he had about a quarter of what was a full vial of liquid L left and if he wanted some then to come through while supplies last. So we headed out to go get it around 10:40 a.m. or so, when we get there M invites us inside and proceeds to drop the squares. Initially we only wanted four single dose tabs and I suppose M wanted to cut the middle man of dropping each individual square so he placed the tabs on the foil and proceeded to apply three drops then folded up the foil  carefully then handed it to my brother saying “Merry late Christmas, enjoy those.”  

We got back to the apartment at around 12:00 p.m. then ate some food and smoked a bowl. At around 12:30 p.m. we ate the tabs and I did the honors of licking the foil. Overall the tabs were not bitter but had a very slight unpleasant taste, neither was my tongue numb so I assume it was the real deal. After 15 minutes of letting it swish around in our mouths making sure they absorbed thoroughly. I have to admit they kicked in quicker than the last time I tripped. I remember looking at my phone at 1:44 and the breathing/wavy visuals were going into full effect, at this point I was listening to Clinic and scrolling through Instagram looking at cheesy psychedelic art, I enjoy doing this because the photos really come to life. However I completely forget about my brother and how he was in the bathroom, he must have been in there for at least an hour, this is when I focused my hearing on the bathroom and I could hear him talking loudly to himself saying things like, “DMT, LSD, Cannabis....” the rest was incomprehensible. 

I got up and knocked on the bathroom door and he immediately opened the door peaking his head out from the door and I asked him to keep the volume down, he just nodded and closed the door. Eventually he came out and we watched Trailer Park Boys and had a few laughs, that’s when out of nowhere my brother lunges at me and gives me a big hug saying something I don’t remember. This made me a little uncomfortable and I told him to calm down and just watch tv with me, he then got up and went to the living room and laid back on the couch and called me to come look at the ceiling with him. I got up, walked to the living and played [ocean jams] on my phone then laid back on the other couch and stared at the ceiling. We were talking about the things we were seeing, he described kollidascbopes and I was seeing 2D fractals.

 I looked at my phone and the time was 2:10, he said he needed to go take a shit so he got and went back to the bathroom. From which he began talking to himself again for quite some time, I wasn’t sure if was still aware of reality. That’s when he started yelling at the top of his lungs “Ohhhhh we one hunnid muthafucka!” Concerned a noise complaint would be called on us I got up and asked him to chill out and keep the noise down before someone calls the cops. I went to my room and started smoking again while watching Trailer Park Boys, I was enjoying myself and the visuals around me and after about 45 minutes my brother comes out of the bathroom and he starts talking about a bunch of random things while darting his eyes around. At that moment I realized that he was freaking out and I tried to calm him down and led him to my room and told him to take a nap and he laid down on my bed which my metal rolling tray was sitting at the edge of and when it made a noise he flips out and yells “Get off of me!” While looking at me as if I did something, then turns over and I assume he closed his eyes, at this moment I knew I had bought myself some time, I grabbed my phone and went to the living room and called my pops, I told him what happened and he said he was in north hollywood on a hike and he’ll try to be home as quick as he can. 

After the phone call ended I laid on the couch and realized I was panicking and started having a bad trip, my heart was racing, so I took some deep breaths to calm myself down. My brother then walks into the living room completely naked and I thought “ah fuck man.” I got up and told him to go take a nap, he immediately walks back to my room and lays backs down. I’m not sure how much time passed after this but he came back acting completely sporadic, throwing his body around and saying random things. I thought, “What if I try to inhibit a positive mindset in him.” So I asked him for a hug and he came over to me and hugged me, at that moment he squatted down then picks me up and slams me down on my back, he didn’t do this in a quick movement so I had time to stick my arm out to brace the impact. Luckily I wasn’t hurt badly other than my lower back pain returning once again. He then wandered back to my room and started to eat some kratom pills, while in a state of panic I considered calling 911, however this wasn’t an option since I’m under informal probation for non-drug related charges. 

Then my initial thought was to wait it out, so I checked my phone again and the time was around 3:50 p.m. and since my pops was about an hour and a half away still I was scared my brother was gonna try hurt me or himself or possibly even try to go outside in the four and half hours of the trip that was left. So I did something I wish I never did, I called my mom, told her the situation without lying whatsoever and asked her to come pick us up and take us to her house so we can come down in a safe place. Hesitantly, she agreed and around a half an hour later she shows up with my grandma and we all try to escort my brother to the car. He kept refusing to go anywhere and eventually we all him dressed and got him in the car, the drive to my mom’s house was the most embarrassing and heartbreaking experience. The entire way my mom was scolding us about using drugs and my grandma couldn’t stop crying. When we got to her house, they took my brother to a guest room and I took a shower, in the shower I cried uncontrollably and fell into an extreme state of sorrow. 

When I got out I looked at myself in the mirror and noticed my pupils were still wide, although I wasn’t hallucinating, my body was still trying to expunge the substance from my system, so I felt physically uncomfortable while waiting to come down. Around 7:30 I was in the kitchen drinking coffee with a bit of whiskey added, my brother then wanders in and sits at the chair across from me and apologized for what he did and after a short moment of not saying anything I told him “I want to say it’s okay, but it’s not.” He apologized again then stood up and prepared a bowl of bean soup, sat back down and asked me to describe what happened. After telling him everything he paid me back for the tabs I purchased but could not enjoy. I told him to keep his money and to just roll and joint when we get home the next day then we’d be solid.

I understand that I could have done everything different to defuse the situation, however I was in a state of panic while hallucinating hard. I recall how difficult it was to collect my thoughts when I was trying to think of options to stop the situation from escalating. I don’t intend on taking any psychedelics soon, especially not with my brother either.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aggnkz/3_doses_of_lsd_freak_out/

I was still in the chair i was sitting in. But my fucking MOM was there. Screaming at me for doing drugs and being completely shocked and scared by my screaming about me dying. Then it happened again. Just like a fucking movie. I realized my mom WASNT there and in fact i was just sitting there with two of my friends. But i swear to you that i saw my mom. Her face, her voice, her attitude, she was just THERE dog. Also, turns out i was NOT screaming even though the entire time i thought i was. I was, in fact, sitting in silence biting my fingers.

I understand that the order of most intense experience is going to depend on the individual as well as the dose of each substance, but I am still curious of what are ya’lls opinion.  Feel free to add other substances not on the original pyramid and include the dose.

Here’s my most to least intense:

1) 14 tabs of acid; 4 tabs then 10 more 4hrs later

2) 3.5 grams lemon tek mushrooms

3) DMT ; don’t remember how much I did, but I didn’t break through

4) Ketamine: 1/2 gram over 1-2 hours

18295,Blacking Out,Dxm and lorazepam (Ativan) blackout,"So i know now this wasnt a good idea but i was in the mood for dxm after taking probably around 3 - 4 mg of ativan. So i drank the bottle of dxm and dxm being the only active ingredient. After drinking the bottle, which weirdly didnt taste as bad as it usually does, managed to not even feel nausea at all. 

Now my total for the night was 3.5 mgish of ativan and 350ish mg of dxm. And because i was feeling great off the ativan, i made the mistake of taking 1 more 1mg line and as soon as i did that line, i cant remember anything except for 1 second of me sitting next to my friend by his fireplace talking.

At 1 am i woke up after being passed out for what my friend said was like 2 hours. I walked to the bathroom to take a piss, and noticed that i didnt feel anything. Like anything at all, no dxm or ativan and just felt normal, which is weird because  of the dxm should have lasted longer, and i didnt even feel an after glow.

I went back to bed but had trouble sleeping so my friend gave me around 2.5 shots of jack daniels i think. And i fell asleep until around 11 am.

Weird expirence and it still almost creeps me out of how much i missed. (It has only been a little over a week and i hardly remember any of the night)

18485,Psychedelics,What i wrote 20 Mins after my DMT Trip,"Took 3 puffs with my friend on a October night this is what I wrote in my notes and forgot about


The Body we occupy in which we sit, it is a mirage  A game played by ourselves out of boredom. Imagine you are a god You have created everything and you are bored so what do you do? Well of course You make yourself forget you are god wait but if your god why would you ever want to do that? Well Imagine dreaming for 300 billion Years straight all the possible feelings you have experienced all the heartbreak and stories you have lived through after you completed everything you would want to experience it once more So you make yourself small as small as a creature, that can think and feel for itself and in association to its environment that has endless possibilities.Now bare with me, if recreation is true, the ability to be reshaped after death, but still carry the same Being you once was in a past life. Well if that's true. Then what that means is that everyone around you is you. Think about it. Once you have been reshaped that doesn't bring in a new creature,new being 
But why can't you feel yourself in everything 
This can mean two things 
The self is unlimited but limited to the rules it abides the Rules you don't know your God

Feel free to skim as it's kind of long but it's kind of fucked too. Pretty sure it was drug induced psychosis or some shit that happened.,"
I look around. I see the world. But none of it makes sense. I don't feel real. It's like I'm watching a movie. I always feel like I'm dreaming. Is this a dream? I feel like I will wake up as if I were dreaming, as when I look around I can see, but I can't accept it: I feel but it's like I'm touching something out of reach. I can talk. But the voice is as if it isn't mine. I can think but do I really own these thoughts? Am I real? My mind is separate from my body at this point. my body travels and does what it wants. My mind follows my body. But it interferes with my body. It's like I'm always in a dream where I'm running, but I never know what I'm running from. 

The anxiety of this feeling is crazy. My heart beats. And I can feel it pounding. But if I put my hand to my chest, It still feels out of place. When I walk towards things. They seem to sometimes stay the same distance away. I can close my eyes, and I feel like nothing in the world exist except panic, and my mind racing. I never feel safe. Something is always off. I forgot what it's like to feel real. I'm not real. I struggle to accept reality and I don't know why. I can tell myself I'm real. But I don't feel it. None of my bodily senses including my vision, touch, hearing, taste make me feel real. It's like I can only use one sense at a time. I often find myself doing things and spacing out. To the point an hour can go by and I feel as if it were seconds. I believe in what I see, and I feel as in my whole life I've never seen a thing.

 I can look and the mirror and tell my brain that the body in the mirror is mine, but it doesn't feel like it. I look myself in the eyes in the mirror and it's like I'm looking at a different person. I look at my hands. I know they are mine, but it feels like they aren't. My hands are always numb. Everything is blurry, all of the time. When I look at stuff it always is slightly moving. I've lost my mind. Or I should say my body lost my mind. In my peripherals I see things that don't exist. I'm tired of the unknown. 

Time goes on no matter what I do, and also continues to go on for whatever I don't do. But what's weird about time is I never can comprehend it, 1 minute and 1 hour are the same thing to me. 1 year and 1 decade are all just a blur. Everything Is a blur. I can't remember the last time I actually ever had fun. I honestly don't think I ever have. You get good at faking a smile, pretending to be human and such. For as long as I can remember I was just a brain in the shell of a body. That doesn't even feel like my own. Places that I've been millions of times still feel strange. Like I don't belong. I don't know where I belong. Every little thing I look at my mind wanders to places beyond. It's like I'm always looking for something but I don't know what I'm looking for. My whole life feels like a dream. The terrifying thought I could wake up at any given moment. What if I'm just dreaming in a dream? And it's in infinite cycle of dreams? I feel the same when I'm in ""reality"" and when I'm also in a ""dream"". 

I close my eyes and it's like the 3 dimensions of length, width, and height don't exist. It's like there is no scale . Everything I can see when I look around, sometimes feels like it's 300 times larger than what it actually is, like everything in the world stays the same size except for the things I can see. Sometimes it's the opposite. When I close my eyes it's the worst. I can close my eyes and either feel as big as the whole universe, or I can feel as small as a grain of sand. But I never feel that I am in ""normal"" dimensions. Nothing seems right. My mind never stops. And time never stops.

 Even if I were to die I feel like the thoughts would continue, because just because my body dies doesn't mean that my mind would. Because they seem to operate on two different planes of existent. The only thing the two have in common are panic. I fear everything because nothing makes sense. Nothing feels real. And I never knew how to feel. I'm afraid of my mind. And I'm afraid of my body. I'm not real. I wish I never was. Or maybe I'm not? Who is someone who doesn't exist to say what exist and what doesn't? Does anything exist?",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/agiuji/saw_someone_write_down_what_they_wrote_on_a_dmt/

I friggin love it, i wouldnt have thoughtit would be this immersive, and there are actually quite a few great games. The funny thing is i only really play when im high, mainly to counteract the nausea, but also cuz weed just makes everything better. Pornis the best. :p

I was just wondering what your thoughts on the topic are. Have you played vr on other drugs before? Has anyone played with a really low tolerance to weed? Im planning on heavily reducing my consumption to one weekend a month, like. I imagine with 0 tolerance a bowl or two would just transport me to another world with that thing on. 

Also some great games to play when high:

-Astroboy rescue mission
-fire wall zero hour
-Eagle flight
-Resident evil 7 (so intense)
-dirt ralley


If anyone had some recommendations iwould appreciate it, alot of games in the psnstore are crap but its hard to tell.

18543,Alprazolam,Going to do the sub justice and see if snorting Xans is real or bullshit,"So I’ve done a solid amount of Xans in the last few months, the most I’ve taken is 4 2mg bars so I’ve experienced a pretty high does, on average I do 2 or 3 2mg bars.

The second time I was very unexperienced with Xans and just didn’t really know what to feel, also did like half a bar and have a pretty big tolerance for bars.

18564,Cannabinoids,Smoking weed daily drastically reduced my quality of life.,"My new years resolution this year was to cut back on how much weed I smoke considering I smoked everyday for months. This eventually lead to stopping all together.  Now that I am a few weeks into a life without weed, I can definitely say my life has overall drastically improved.

However, I think this is mostly because my sleep quality has improved. I have a fitness watch that tracks how long I sleep and what sleep stage I am in throughout the night. I got it for christmas and began wearing it everyday. Since I was on  Christmas break from college, I was obviously smoking daily since I had no responsibilities and honestly I could almost consider myself addicted to weed.

During this time, my watch tracked me at sleeping 5-6 hours a night on average with literally 0 hours of deep sleep over 4 days. This alerted me that I was constantly sleep deprived. So I began to make a conscious effort to go to bed earlier, yet I still rarely reached the deep sleep stage and continued to stay in the light sleep stage all throughout the night.

It was not until I listened to the JRE podcast with Matthew Walker who studies sleep that I finally understood why I couldnt get quality rest. It is simply because smoking weed consistently over a long period of time literally blocks you from reaching the deep sleep stage. I highly recommend this podcast. It is truely eye opening at how important sleep is to the body.  So after I heard all this information, I decided to leave my beloved weed behind me in 2018.


Now, every night I am averaging an hour and a half of deep sleep and everyday I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to go. After fighting basic weed withdrawals off, I really dont even crave it anymore like I used to. My motivation for life has skyrocketed and I am throughly excited for what this year has to offer. Finally got back into the gym (gone 5 days a week for two weeks straight now) and school is much less stressful now. I can actually pay attention for the entirety of my class and my homework gets done every single day. 

Sorry if this post has dragged on but I am just trying to explain how much better I feel without weed in my life. 

Now I am definitely not saying weed is bad for you. I will most likely smoke again but I dont think I will ever let myself fall back into the daily routine of smoking weed. After all, too much of anything isnt good for you when you reach a certain point right?



Edit: I was not trying to shit on weed or weed users with this post. Probably was not the best choice of a title for this post. Definitely was not trying to offend anyone. Im only trying to point out that abusing weed probably is not the best thing to do. I love weed and what it has to offer but after feeling the effects of having no weed in my life, I wanted to share what I have noticed since Ive stopped.

Edit: Moderation is key. Thank you all for the comments and helping me to realize this. I appreciate all the kind words and encouragement. Definitely going to continue with this sobriety for the time being but you all have made me realize my personal routine was the issue rather than weed itself. 

Also yes the watch is most likey inaccurate, but I still think it is a useful tool to use as a reference point on how much sleep you get through the night. Please listen to the JRE Matthew Walker podcast about sleep. It is truly mind blowing. Made me realize how crucial sleep is to our overall health.",435,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/agje0x/smoking_weed_daily_drastically_reduced_my_quality/
18573,Cannabinoids,Any one else notice how it seems like more chronic smokers (weed) are quitting recently because of mental health problems or they feel better without it?,"I'm all for safe use and moderation of pot as well as legalization. But along with this I see more chronic users smoking because of mental issues or feeling better without it. What I'm about to say doesn't really apply to light or moderate smokers.

I used to smoke daily for 4 years and quit because one day it's like a switch flipped and I couldn't smoke without anxiety fucking me a new one. I'm hearing similar stories among chronic users (wether it be anxiety or derealization).

Maybe shit now days is too strong or something for a lot of people but I see a lot of chronic users just turning around and quitting. It's no myth that moderate usage of weed isn't that bad if your not in your developing years. And even those teens majority of the heavy users don't even have problems. But in seeing a trend where more people keep quitting.

18577,Cannabinoids,DPRD after weed - I kinda liked it?,"Just wanted to share this interesting tidbit. It's been half a year, maybe a bit more since this occurrence and I'm free of any effects. So, I was watching altered carbon with my gf, enjoying the awesome series and generally feeling fine. The following week, I smoked a lot. Like a few grams every day for a straight week, it was wild. After I stopped smoking, I noticed this weird rough and jagged feeling to reality, like it was a framed picture with some pieces cut out. It got so bad at some point, that I could watch reality shatter, be flipped upside down and then fall back into place. I couldn't fathom that I was actually related to my grandmother or that *I* as a person was anybody or related to anybody. I lost my sense of self for a while, became a leaf on the stream of creation. I could hear Takeshi Kovacs (the main character from Altered Carbon) speaking in my head, commenting on the state of mankind, on the state of my family, generally just being a cynical and violent dick. At some point, I *was* Takeshi. It felt strange to be someone I obviously wasn't, but at the same time it was an interesting experience. Did anybody else experience anything similar?

18583,Psychedelics,Top songs in your psychedelic playlist?,"Songs in my trip are one of the most incredible factors for making my trip amazing, here are few tracks I love listening to, mostly for trippers by trippers.

The Pot - Tool
Lateralus - Tool
Dark side of the moon(whole album)- Pink Floyd
Echoes - Pink Floyd
Work This time - King gizzard and the Lizard Wizard
Sky walker - King gizzard and the Lizzard Wizard
Led Zepplin IV - Led Zepplin

Just want to add a special mention to Breathe(In the Air)  by Pink Floyd. As soon as I play this track, all my visuals dramatically change and calm down(good for bad trips, anxious moments. Etc.)

These are just some of the songs that makes me “feel things”

I haven't actually seen too many people talk about the effects that it has physically such as extreme comfort or extreme pulsating sensations in random parts of your body that just feel downright fantastic, rather than the trips. Problem is, the last time that me and my girlfriend tripped (we went up a dose, from 60ug which we absolutely tripped out on) to 150ug each. Seemingly, there was no pulsating or repetitive actions like the last time (I always bite my lip on psychedelics, not sure why it just feels real good), and then end up actually harming it a small amount in the process. But it feels so good. So out of interest, is there a purer form of the drug which gives you more physical than visual effects?

18704,Cannabis,Weed experience totally changed for me. Anyone else?,"I used to smoke literally all day, everyday. I mean I'd wake up, smoke a blunt, take a shower, smoke a blunt, make coffee, smoke a blunt, go to work, smoke a blunt on break etc. This was when I first smoked at the age of 18. I stopped smoking entirely for a month when I was in a hospital. After I left I was fragile and started drinking instead as it was easier access. Anyway fast forward several years. I started smoking again. The experience for me is almost totally different from what I remember it being. It used to just be a sort of blissed out contentedness. Basically anything could happen and I would be able to shrug it off with the attitude ""this is just a part of being alive. It's part of the experience."" However now when I smoke its nothing like that. I can't ""zone out"" and move right along like I used to. My interactions with family and friends aren't articulate so I don't smoke around other people. When I'm alone I ""forget"" to breathe. Not like a panic attack but once I remember to breathe again then I worry I will have a panic attack. Its like self fulfilling prophecy of sorts lol. Anyways I still smoke and usually once it passes I can continue to smoke and I just get extremely sleepy. As a person, I do not like talking to people really at all. It's not a shy thing or I don't have opinions but I've found that most ""discussions"" are just pointless, empty, and a waste of energy. When I smoke though, it goes to a different level. I feel like the more I try to describe something the farther from the truth I get. So I don't even talk via internet while smoking. 
Has ANYONE experienced anything like this? Maybe I'm just getting old. For the record shrooms and LSD I can take once every 6 months or so and no problems at all. I also take kratom every day in the morning. Just for some current drug use.

18714,Cannabinoids,Asshole friend got what he deserves,"Alright so let me tell you guys about this kid who I thought was my friend, in this story I’ll be calling him backwoods because that’s what he wants to smoke because it’s in a bunch of SoundCloud songs. 

Anyways backwoods and I were good friends and hung out a lot, id pick him up, drive to the mall metro parks, just whatever. I bought him food and monsters a lot and he said he’ll get paid that Friday so he’ll pay me back so I was like why not. That Friday comes and he got the money and wanted to try out the cartridges so we went to our guy and got two because I was gonna pay him back for that, he paid 80.00 for two.

 We went to one store for a battery and he bought it, we then went to another store and he found a deal and bought the other one. I asked if I could buy the one he’s not using and he said yeah, in fact he said “give me fourty for all.” So I was being so thankful like thanks man blah blah blah then I verified saying it’s fourty for the cartridge and the battery and he said yeah. The next day he randomly FaceTimes me while I’m soaking and toking and was like “hey when are you giving me the money” and I was like “hey I’ll just give it to you tomorrow I’m gonna hangout here today.” He said alright and then said “you know how much right” so I was like “yeah fourty”, he was then like “naw man fourty just for the cart”. In the long run he wanted his eighty and I’m not giving that to him because he said fourty and I verified it because I knew he was gonna do something like this. I told him no that I wasn’t going to give him that. He randomly texted me one day saying “yo I was talking to (person from tripping story) and he’s using you as an accessory to smoke” so I texted that friend and asked him. His response was like uhm no that’s actually what he told me about you, saying that backwoods is using the same story on both of us as if we don’t talk to eachother lol. Keep in mind he’s always been like that to people always starting shit behind their backs. After that I was like fuck him. I was cleaning out my car and found his vape, so I took it and didn’t say anything.

18745,TRUE STORY 🍻,Fighting a cop &amp; getting away with it (story),"2 years prior to my last story I ended up in Miami again. Hollywood Florida to be specific. It was Spring 2016 I believe. I went to a pool party with a friend of mine that night. For the sake of foreshadowing keep in mind this friend is maybe 300-400 lbs &amp; maybe 6’3 in height &amp; I’m a 5’11 , 140 lbs, small guy. Before this night every party we had a debate on who could out drink who. At that time I knew for sure I could out drink him even though he’s huge. 

So tonight at this party there’s enough alcohol to finally put it to the test. He agrees. We challenge each other to pour up this evil concoction and last man standing wins. We pour, white wine, red wine, bud light beer, svedka vodka, sailor jerry AND Hennessy all into 2 cups. One for me, one for him. We kill those cups. Mind you we were already drunk before hand.

The cups are gone &amp; we’re both still standing. Barely! But still standing.... I challenge him again. The vodka was the only thing left. “Let’s chug this vodka last man standing wins.” We both proceed to take turns chugging this disgusting vodka. No cocaine to straighten us out tonight. Just liquor. We finish the bottle and walk back out by the pool where all the girls were.

I go over to this girl I like and I’m flirting with her. She was our ride here. While in my drunken romantic rant to this girl I hear a commotion behind me. The girl looks and says “oh my god” while laughing. I turned around and see my big friend falling over shit like a walrus. He tried to sit on this chair that broke and rolled on to the ground. I guess I win.

He’s passed out. Still mumbling but basically passed out. It’s 3am at this time though and the girl wants to go home. She has like a 2 hour drive home(she didn’t drink btw) Me &amp; about 4 people try to pick this big limp fucker up. Shit wasn’t working while he’s mumbling “leave me alone” I’m like “we gotta go bitch” (I know I’m an asshole) he finally comes to a tiny bit and gets up and goes to the car with us.

Finally in the car I beg this girl to stop and get me something to eat not realizing it’s 4 am at this point. She goes to McDonald’s. The drive thru line is ridiculously long and I’m impatient. Also known to be an angry drunk I say fuck this and try to go inside. I go to the McDonald’s door and it’s locked. I bang on the window because I see a lady working inside I yell “what the fuck , let me in” I know, I’m stupid. The inside is closed but c’mon man do you know how drunk I am?!?!?

I get so angry I start pulling on the door and kicking it trying to break in, almost breaking the glass. What the fuck was I thinking. While doing this I assume the lady called the cops. My friends are still in the car in the drive thru line. I give up and go back to the car in the drive thru line NOT REALIZING THE LINE HAD MOVED FOWARD. My friends car was white and it was a white car in the same place so I went to it thinking it was my friends.

My drunk ass goes to the car door and its locked. I keep yanking the door handling while laughing and I’m like “stop playing guys.” The windows are tinted so I put both my hands to them and look in the window only to realize I don’t know who the fuck these people are but they looked scared as shit. In the background I here my friends yell “over here!” I’m like “oh shit sorry” and run to the right car.

In my head I know I just caused a scene in this drive thru so we gotta fucking leave. But we’re stuck in this drive thru line cars in front and cars behind and line not moving. I’m blackout drunk &amp; angry at this point. Finally cops come and knock on my side window of the car. Everyone in that car is like act cool... I wish I knew how. I roll my window down to talk to the cops barely making any sense I try talking to them. They realize I’m drunk and tell me step out the car.... fuck

I step out the car like a dumbass I ask “what I do” they look at me like a pile of shit. Their questioning me about the night and how much I had to drink and wanted to do a sobriety test. To save them time I just said “bruh, I’m drunk as shit” while talking they keep inching closer and closer to me. It was 3 cops. My friends hadn’t got out the car yet. I was paranoid &amp; drunk. It’s like I forgot they were cops haha.

While they step closer and closer to me they almost get in my face and I say “if y’all step closer I’m gonna steel off, please back up” they laugh amongst each other and keep inching in. I officially had a promise to fulfill. I yelled “I told you to back the fuck up” and I punch the closest cop like 4-5 or five times in the face before all three of them grab me like a fucking rag doll and tag team suplexed me into the nearby grass. Seriously, not even kidding I did a full front flip onto my fucking back.

Now I’m laying on the ground in pain. Staring at the sky. I have no words. One cop has his knee in my chest so I couldn’t speak without feeling a hint of lung cancer. The cops are asking me “what the fuck we’re you thinking” the cop I punched was pissed while checking his face for marks. My huge friend and the girl ran over to the cops begging them to let me go saying “please officers he’s not from here and he’s really drunk we’ll make sure he gets home safe” the girl starts crying.

The cops have a little sympathy that night and they let me up and they yell at my friends to make sure I get the fuck home. I’m so drunk when I stand up I look at the cop I punched and I try to shake his hand while saying “truce” he looked at my hand with disgust then looked me in my eyes like he wanted to spit in my face. In my head I’m thinking “what’s up his ass” but my friend grabs me by my shirt and throws me into the back of the car while repeatedly calling me a dumbass.

The whole ride home my friends are yelling at me how lucky I am i didn’t get shot. I disregard it. But honestly, when does a black kid ever get to punch a cop and get away with it !? Oh yea, huge plot twist, I’m black. The next morning I wake up in my bed in a pool of piss and a face full of throw up. I’m still so drunk I think “who the fuck pissed and threw up on me” seriously. I asked my roommate that shit and he looked at me like an idiot.

- Is there a best way to take it? Can you snort it for faster results?

- Is there a max dose that I need to stay under in a 24 hour period or something? Dangerous in taking too much in the same day or taking it sporadically/different doses everyday?

- What happens when you’re coming down from it and is there a good way to deal with this if it gets bad?

- When high, how is weed when combined with it? Alcohol? Xanax?

18788,Opioids,What is it with people believing kratom can't get you high?,"I often read comments on here where people say that kratom cannot get you high or that it is only a very subtle high comparable to coffee and not at all comparable with stronger opioids and act like I'm talking bullshit when I disagree with them. 

I've taken several opioids so I can compare the effects (Tramadol, Codeine, Tilidine, Morphine, Opium and Poppy tea) and good kratom in the right dose can certainly make you very high.

When taken in very low doses, especially with whites and greens, yes, kratom acts as a subtle stimulant and mood enhancer. Another factor is quality, there are many shops (not even starting on headshop kratom) out there, who sell really shitty kratom. If you take like 1-3g of that then yes, it will certainly be even less noticable. There is kratom out there that shitty that even 10g+ will be very very subtle. 

I won't link vendors here, but without a tolerance or a low tolerance (with heavy opioid tolerance you will need much more), a good red or green in the range of 4-8g can certainly make you very euphoric and sedated. 

Be careful though, nausea might occur even at 4g's for some people, it's a combination of the powder not being that stomach friendly and the typical opioid-nausea side effect that mitragynine and 7-ho-mitragynine can produce.  Ginger or in extreme cases an anthihistamine can help. I even prefer this over weaker opiods like tramadol or codeine, Kratom has a special warm and euphoric glow to it. Ilike to drink a beer after dosing to enhance the experience, Kratom puts me in a really dreamy, sedated state of bliss.

Be warned though, Kratom can be very addictive and tolerance rises fast.

18836,LSD,A hard trip on Acid and my Ego,"I want to share my experience and consult the experts which is at the end of this post: sorry for the long one

TDLR; tripped on acid, got into a tough trip, which I didn’t mind but I hated to see my ego controlling myself.

So I went to a 40hrs psytrance festival, very intense, deep and dark visuals and music, indoor of course this NYE, the setup was 4floors, 7stages built to be a maze, you get in and don't get out. I decided with my buddy to take acid, and thought the best option is to lower the dose since it’s very intense environment, instead of 150ug, we tried to take half of the liquid drop. 

Now we thought it didn’t kick in, after a couple of hrs we decided to smoke weed and hash, and after sometime everything started to change dramatically, started losing control and not able to think of anything except of my ego: I couldn’t control myself, neither find my friend and got freaked out (until this moment I didn't know what is happening with me and that is because of ACID) I started delusioning, and seeing  myself getting into infinite loops, moves and thoughts. I lost it, i knew it, felt of a strong need to throw up, and I wanted to leave this place. As I said it was a maze, indoor and very dark, I started going up trying to find the sun or something more relaxing, in the way found up my acid I found my friend and other friends, reached the last floor, was sunny and then my fear has changed into a clear picture, seeing people in perfect sync and jumping like they were praying and chanting as I felt we are closer to God above everyone and everyone was so happy, I felt a bit of relief and couldn’t believe what I saw, I felt a strong connection with these ppl, looking at me and looking at them as if they are inviting me to step inside the stage and felt this room is only for ppl who reached their ultimate high, ultimate spirituality. 

At the end, i managed to find my way out and go to my hotel with my acid friend. 

To be honest, this trip and hallucination didn’t worry me, it is expected from such a party and substance. What I was worried about is what I saw in myself and this is not the first time, I saw my ego, I do usually when I'm high but this time I met my ego, I was trying to stop it and resist the change, get away from it, I was worried people to see me fucked and insane, afraid of my image and perception of myself to change infornt of the crowd who could care less about me.

This ego limited me from being free, letting myself go and enjoy the moment.  

Everybody was fucked and high and everybody was in peace with everyone and wouldn’t give a damn of who I am or what I look, but I just hated to see this resistance in the purest moment of connection with myself and wasted my trip just trying to control myself and have this image of a nice looking guy in the dance floor who thinks everybody is looking at him, his moves as if I'm a rockstar who girls will approach him! who the fuck I am.

It’s just an ugly man! I always think and see people look at me and think of myself as an icon or someone noticeable, I want to let go, I don’t want to think of my image and how people perceive me! I feel I’m arrogant from the inside! I don’t know how to explain it better 

Also I realized the LSD kicked in, but I didn;t know that, even I lost control, I didn;t the reason and I forgot I took lsd, i was busy with my ego and I knew i lost it because of lsd when i left the venue which is maybe a total of 6 or 8hrs.

18884,Opioids,"The time ""bill the basehead"" broke into my locker at a homeless shelter and snorted a line of kratom in the bathroom, then proceeded to scream at me until we both got kicked out.","I cannot believe I forgot to post this story. I meant to post it once I got WiFi but totally forgot. This was last summer.      
       
1 night in the shelter, hell on Earth. I check in, ""do you have any needles on you?""      
       
First question. Dope, this is going to be great.    
          
They half-heartedly sift through my bag, I don't look like a junkie so I'm laughing with the guy, joking that he needs to make sure I don't get the shit beaten out of me while I'm here, as I'm a scrawny white dude who looks like he'd fold in half pretty easily. Also I look rich, not a good thing in a shelter.       
      
He asks if I have any drugs in there. I say ""nothing illegal, I know you guys are going to want to lock up my kratom though"".     
     
I willingly pull out my kilo, unopened, still in the shipping bubble mailer, they lock it up after a long-ass annoying conversation where I explain it's legal, they say I can have it back when I leave.       
       
I expected this, gotta give them something to find. Luckily I had 250g spread across my person, my backpack, etc. I actually had a shitton of weed in regular bud form, capsules, tinctures, wax, and carts. Easily $200 worth. So I was happy to have them lock up my kilo and let me in for the night of shitshow. They were all just out of where he was searching, if the dude unzipped my little pencil case I would've been in deep shit.         
         
In my right pocket, I've got a small baggie with exactly 5g of kratom. Looks so druggy it's just stupid.     
     
""Gotta get this shit off my person"", I think to myself.    
     
Crackhead, I say crackhead because the other people in the shelter affectionately called him ""Bill the basehead"", (actually the staff called him that too) watches me check in and get my shit confiscated. He also watches me get a locker.    
     
Bill is kinda jittery, a little scary, old af bit maybe just mid 30s and drugged to death?    
     
I've been to this shelter before, I've got friends. Mostly staff, but about 2 guys who are old and have my back.    
      
One is Frank, a white bearded old man who was so sweet the first time I was there and the only person I fept comfortable talking to.  
      
Now idk if anyone has ever been to one of these places. A staff member gives you the combo to your locker and it's not discreet. I noticed bill hovering around. I look around, nobody watching (so I thought), I transfer the little bag into my locker and shove it in my jacket.      
      
I head to the bathroom. I'm walking in, someone is walking out with a tape and cotton on his arm. Yeah, that kind of shelter. Just casually shoot up.     
       
Bill comes in a few minutes later. I'm brushing my teeth, he goes into a stall all anxious. The stalls are like every stall in America, there's a little crack. I see him dump green powder onto the toilet paper dispenser, and I fucking bolt out.     
        
I know exactly what is about to happen.    
      
He's going to snort a line of kratom, and be fucking pissed at me. 
       
I run to Frank, tell him what's about to go down, say I need to hide.    
      
*""Dude, you can't hide, you just checked in, this is going to go down so badly.""*    
     
*""So what the fuck do I do?""*    
     
*""Just get behind me""*     
     
Says Frank, the 5'4' old man trying to protect the 5'11"" scrawny white dude from the impending crack-pocalypse. He backs me right near the staff desk, the locked area where the staff are all able to see us from, and we brace for impact     
       
Then we hear it.      
       
# ""Owwww, aahhhhh what THE FUCKKKKK"".     
         
*Staff all perk up.*    
    
Bill comes storming out.     
       
""I'm going to fucking kill you!"" Says bill, nose and face covered green.     
      
Bill charges both of us and the staff are on him before he gets two steps further       
      
Bill is tackled. Bill is kicked out. I say that, I mean carried out kicking and screaming. Literally thrown on the concrete.        
       
They explain that I need to leave, but they are making sure I'll be safe outside first.     
       
They arrange a ride to another shelter, about 20 minutes away, a much much worse shelter, and I say alright.      
       
I'm handed my kratom kilo.       
 
It is only now that the staff puts the dots together. Frank is dying of laughter, the staff is dying of laughter, I'm cracking up while simultaneously checking my surroundings so I don't get fucking stabbed.    
        
I got into the cab.     
       
There is more to this story but I'm ending here.   
       
I saw Bill 2 more times that summer. That's what I'll hint at and end this post.  ",50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/agon5l/the_time_bill_the_basehead_broke_into_my_locker/

18974,Addiction Story,"| My Codeine Addiction Story | From start, to end | 20yo, UK |","I just want to thank the community here for the information and support. Y'all are great. 

# Hi guys, sorry for the long post! This is a story of how my addiction started, to the point where I'm at now!

&amp;#x200B;

We start with the first time taking it. At this point my mental health was fucked completely, to the point that I tried to kill myself with pills I found in my parent cupboard. (Co-Codamol, \[30mg, Codeine\] \[500mg, Paracetamol\]). So my naive self grabbed 6 strips of 10 pills and took them all, hoping for it to be enough to do the job cause there was nothing else there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of killing me, it made me feel so fucking good. I then started taking it every so often to block out the bad things in my head. Which I now realise was the worst idea of my life, as the bad things would just come right back after it wears off. Now I know codeine isn't the worst thing to get addicted to. But it gets worse from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few weeks after starting to take them every so often, I start getting generalised joint pain my my legs. So off I go to the worst doctor who was my only choice at the time; who then offers me a few different analgesics until I suggested the cocodamol tablets which are listed above, and of course. I said these would be the best option for me as I've taken them before and they really really work for my pain. All that bullshit of a desperate man wanting to zone out for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, they did end up prescribing me the Co-Codamol, and because the doctor, who was the worst at his job, well I wont lie, to me he was the best doctor around for giving me all these pills at the time. I was on Co-Codamol for a while until I admitted to the doctor that  I'd been using more than I should daily. In which he quickly swapped me to just Codeine Phosphate 30mg to prevent paracetamol from fucking up my organs. But kept me primarily on codeine, even after the recommended 2 weeks only. 

&amp;#x200B;

My tolerance increased quite quickly, so month on month I would up the dose even more. Then I'd eventually use more than my prescription, so I'd have to find a way to get more. I live near a lot of pharmacies in which I floated between them one by one, purchasing the strongest codeine based pain killer I could over the counter. Which fucked up my debt situation really bad as I was using my credit card to buy these. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nearly 2 years on, I'm still on these pills. The second I wake up in the morning. 600-900mg goes in and I chill. (I know people say there's a ceiling dose, but I dont go over 900mg cause for me it doesn't make the high any better it just wastes pills) This has happened every day for the past year, so my use is out of control. Mainly because I don't bother CWE'ing the paracetamol from the pills, and that's dangerous as fuck, I know. But having the high quickly is the thing running through my mind. Honestly, it has ruined my life. I aspire to go back to college(uk) and actually finish my courses and be semi-successful instead of living in a hostel, being on my own and popping pills to escape.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, I went to a place which helps with people who are addicted to substances. Talked about my situation, how much I'm taking, and what primarily caused my addiction. It felt so good to actually let it out to someone. It feels good getting it out in the open here. Anyway, the team there are so kind. And I'm getting in touch with the site doctor that will tell me which substitute would be the best for me to wean off completely. Cause dose reduction with the codeine itself is so hard. Mainly placebo in my head, thinking there's not the same amount, I wont feel as good.

&amp;#x200B;

But, the point where I'm at now, I'm hopeful that I can beat this shit. Cause any addiction is hard, it just depends on the person addicted and their will power to get off of their high of choice. I'm looking forward to where my road leads now, I don't see any addiction in my future!

&amp;#x200B;

To anyone thinking about giving up, or are having a bad time trying. If I can do this, then anyone can. My willpower is the lowest around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck all! Thanks,

George.

Let me tell you, I felt addicted before I was addicted. This makes no sense at the moment but for my whole life I couldn't function. Couldn't do anything cause of my crippling anxiety.

I started taking Xanax moderately and that's how I knew I'm gonna end up a fuck up in the end (spoiler: I did).
Everytime I was anxious I was taking a Xanax, everytime I felt bad I was taking a Xanax, I needed them to even go outside or socialize at all. 
Got heavily addicted until last October when I started cutting off BUT, it's not the dependence I have, it's that I can't function with even the normal levels of anxiety I have. Withdrawals make it worst so I am giving up slowly.

That drug fucked me over countless times but all I want is to be the person I wanna be.

I just hope someone else out here can relate to this situation. Unlike many others I don't care about being addicted or the consequences as long as I can act like a normal human that my severe anxiety prevents me from being.

19112,Psychedelics,My teenage experience with psychedelics. (I DO NOT CONDONE UNDERAGE USE).,"I highly recommend psychedelics to anyone ready enough to try them, **EXCEPT TEENAGERS.**

I'm nearly 18, and my occasional use of psychedelics has changed the way my malleable teenage brain works and I will be forever grateful for that. On the other hand, the sudden (few-month long) change in my mental/emotional acuity and general attitude towards life is hard to come to terms with, especially because my teen years have been the most formative of my life.

I believe that moderate use of psychedelic drugs can enhance the way that a person sees the world (drawing on my personal experiences). Since I tried psychs for the first time, I have become a more empathic, positive, and understanding person and I certainly wouldn't have adopted healthier mental health habits if it hadn't been for some revelations made on mushrooms, mescaline, LSD, etc.

That being said, part of me is always going to wish that I never tried those drugs at as early of an age, simply because it's too much **fucking** information for a seventeen year old kid to handle. Being shown the core values of humanity and the deepest, darkest corners of the human psyche definitely takes a toll on a young mind and I was not prepared for the journeys psychs would take me on. 

I find it really hard to conform to ""normal"" adolescent standards and views (of life?? Philosophy?? Not quite sure of the exact concept.) I find high school drama trivial and homework tedious and unnecessary because in the Grand Scheme of Things™️, homework, drama, and school doesn't matter. I no longer care for math, English, physics, or any other subjects that once held my attention. I'm more interested in psychology, art, and music. I spend my time seeking connections between natural/man made things that don't seem to exist to non-users. I see more beauty in nature and the free world than I ever did and I love being able to consciously switch in and out of that 'psychedelic headspace'. My creativity has soared higher and higher with every trip. I feel unstoppable with psychs.

Though, the bad always finds a way to hide among the good. I am obsessed with finding the answers to broad, philosophical concepts. I crave the psychedelic experience now more than ever before. I can't relate to the people around me anymore, which makes it harder than ever to connect with people who are important to me. I can no longer comfortably give people the advice they want to hear, the advice that pleases them; I feel the need to tell people exactly how things are, even if they are in the wrong (which used to make my brain itch a little, I felt like I was being a dick if I was 100% honest). I feel quite disconnected from society and expected social norms. I question everything at face value; the government, money/capitalism, tried-and-true ways of success, the meaning of life, etc.

Truthfully, I could go on and on and on about my personal psychedelic experiences for hours on end, but it wouldn't mean much, anyway. 

I would like the takeaway from this [small] article to be that psychedelics can and will change how ur brain works. Use them with caution, especially if you are underage (I personally don't recommend underage use at all, IMO.), but put in the rights hands at the right time, they can certainly change your life for the better. But only if you seek to better yourself.

19126,Methamphetamine,Adderall high vs the Meth high from my point of view.,"Now im blasted off adderall rn and felt like making this. Sorry if its a long block of unreadable text. One of the biggest reasons is before I ever tried methamphetamine I always looked up how similar the high was to adderall and never got many good answers. I have only done meth one time (ROA was smoking) but I have done adderall more than I care to admit. I would say I was full on addict at one point doing easily 200+ mg a day until I had enough of it and took a long break. I might not be the most qualified person to answer this because of only doing meth one time and only having experience with one ROA but i'd like to give my two cents none the less. FYI drugs in general are all subjective, your experience might and will differ.

So anyway, I think of the comparison like coke vs pepsi. Very clearly similar substances but at the same time differences that I can notice clearly. The main difference was the ROA. Smoking it gave you an instant peak, you literally feel different right when it goes into your lungs and within 10 seconds max I was feeling it fully. This makes a big difference to taking adderall orally or even snorting IMO because peaking instantly is more enjoyable for most and because of that more addictive. Even snorting adderall it takes around 5 minutes for me to feel it fully. 

Now as far as the peak on both, very similar. 10 times more similar than different but there were differences. One difference for me is I was able to focus more on one thing with meth. With adderall my mind is more all over and I wanna do so many different things but with meth doing one thing for hours sounded more appealing. Also, meth was more ""calming"" its hard to describe what I mean by that but adderall makes me twitch and tweak more I find. I would say that the adderall high to me feels more ""dirty"" than meth which is weird when you think about it considering addy is pharma grade. Now as far as sheer euphoria and confidence, meth takes it. Meth was more euphoric by quite a large bit and I had more of a  ""on top of the world"" feeling with meth. 

Another thing is the desire to redose. Im not sure what it is but the desire to redose on adderall never happened to nearly the extent of meth. Right when I started to feel it wearing off all I could think about was smoking more, and I did. For 2 days straight until I ran out and couldnt get anything more out of the pipe or the stem without burning my lips. With adderall I CAN go on day binges but with meth it just felt like what you HAD To do. Like the substance itself was telling me I had to keep doing it until I couldnt. Adderall I have been able to do it for the day, knock myself out with something, wake up and do it again. Meth I just wanted to stay up and do more and more and sleep wasnt on my mind. It was way more fiendish and made me the definition of a crackhead. I even started turning against my friend because i thought he was giving himself bigger hits than I was taking. From what I can tell a lot of this has to do with the ROA and not as much the substance itself.

The comedown for adderall is much worse though for me. With the adderall comedown I actually feel like SHIT and I just wanna go to bed and wake up sober. Meth it was more about the cravings and less ""I feel like shit."" I did candyflip shortly after I ran out of meth though without any true sleep and hadn't eaten or drank in 2 days. and the comedown from that was something ill never forget, espeically cause I didn't drink or eat while candy flipping either. But thats off topic. Ever since I sobered up from everything I do think about meth quite a lot but its pretty easy to resist going to get more when I wasn't coming off from it. But thats how it gets you, dont trust that. You think it's easy enough to control until you are making excuses as to why you are breaking your rule of ""only doing once every few months"" or whatever your personal rule is. I know a lot of people with that exact story.

Goddamn this is long so im gonna wrap it up but again, this is all my subjective experience and I just wanted to go in a good amount of detail on what the differences are to me personally. I would like to eventually take meth orally and snorted (though it would be hard for me to not smoke it) because a lot of these differences can be explained due to the ROA from what I can gather.

EDIT: Thanks to someone in the comments im gonna add this, I do not know the quality of the product I had. I do not know much about meth in that regard and REALLY didnt when I tried it. If I had a pic I would post it in the stims subreddit and ask but I do not. I assume it was good because of the source (being someone very experienced in meth and a good friend of my friend) but that doesn't really mean shit now does it. Im in las vegas and im not 100% on the general quality you can expect of meth around here so if anyone knows lmk. I assume good, the quality of everything here is usually top notch.

In the past 2 years only i have lost so many people to this same drug and i cant even describe how im feeling right now. I just lost one of my homies to this shit on fucking christmas. 

Right away i started telling him what horrible mistake he made and that this drug is nothing to play around with. He was hesitant at first and tried to tell me how ”it isnt that bad” and ”im only doing it this one time”. I told him how i cant even count the people i have lost to this shit with two hands and  how it is basically comparable to heroin and he got pretty shook and worried but knowing his addictive personality i dont think that will help much. I had pretty heavy lean addiction myself couple years back and i know this shit aint no joke. 

I have no idea how should i stop him from ruining his life but im not going to lose another friend so im asking is there anything i can do? I have tried to help my addict friends in the past without success but this time im ready to do all it takes. Hell i will lock him to my basement for a week if nothing else works.

19280,yourtexthere,My SO and I want to try drugs/alcohol together. We want recommendations. (More info in text),"Hello r/drugs! To be clear- my SO will probably be reading this thread from his account- quietly lurking away. Thank you for any thoughts and recommendations. 

For context, we completely have different drug preferences. He likes psychedelics like LSD, and mushrooms and sometimes marijuana. 

When I took drugs I liked opiates and benzos. (I DO NOT Like marijuana) I have not taken drugs for a long time because I am a recovering heroin addict which my SO supports. I’ve been clean from H for over four years now and I don’t have any urges to go back. 

We’ve recently discussed to try drugs together recreationally. He takes some drugs-sparingly and recreationally but until recently I haven’t done anything. Last weekend we drank together. That was fun and we’d want to do it again. This is where the recommendation part comes in. 

What would you all suggest- alcohol wise- that can get us relatively drunk quickly (it took us three Angry Orchards last week each) and doesn’t taste at all like alcohol ? Hopefully isn’t that expensive. The only thing I can think of is Angry Orchards and Smirnoffs because they don’t “taste like alcohol” and have ridiculous sugar. (We started with alcohol because it’s the easiest to find... but we have access. ) 

Also, what drugs would you recommend for us to use together even though we have completely different drug preferences? Perhaps something mellow? 

Important note: We are both level headed, safe adults. We make sure to do our research on drug interactions, dosaging, safety steps and harm reduction. 

Thanks everyone for reading and your recommendations! 

TLDR: Looking for alcohol/drugs recommendations that my SO and I can take with each other. We want meaningful drug use and have experience separately but not together. Please read text for more info. ^^

19301,I :love: Drugs,I don't want to feel guilty about my habits.,"So I'm fairly new to drugs and just started smoking weed eight months ago and in that time I've also taken acid, molly, and nitrous. I make sure that I get high safely and I take care to minimize harm. I really enjoy getting high and being high but I feel horrible for it. I'm in college to be an elementary school teacher, I work at a before school and after school program where I can have from 15-35 pupils by myself, and I volunteer regularly at my local elementary school. I enjoy my job and I can't wait to have a classroom to myself but I feel like as a future teacher and someone who currently works with children I am held to a much different standard. In my introduction to education class (basically we learned how a teacher functions in a community) we talked at length about leading a life that can't be scrutinized by parents. I've been warned to not go to bars and get drunk it public and it is total bullshit. Just because I am a teacher does not mean that I cannot enjoy drinking and getting high and I believe it makes me a better teacher. My job is so stressful and I'm often thrown into situations that I have no training for like when I'm being bit, hit, and having a pupil threaten my life. Before I started smoking wed I would go home and cry about these situations and I wouldn't be able to let go but with weed I get to relax. I only smoke weed and drink when school is in sessions and I would never come to school in an altered state. I feel like it makes me not only a better person but a better teacher and it break my heart that parents and other workers at the school would shun me and I would be fired if they knew about my habits. I don't want to feel so bad for doing things that relax me and make me better at teaching.

 I can't imagine another profession and I have never had a day when I didn't want to got to work. This is my dream job and I can't wait to be a teacher but I just wish that parents understood that we are human too and enjoy these things just as much as other people.

19330,Caffeine,Sensitivity to stimulants? Lack of focus?,"*long post alert*
*typing on stimulants alert*

From the flair tag in the post, yes, to many of you individuals browsing through this sub-Reddit, it may seem as a mere joke, but I can assure you that it isn’t so. 

I don’t consume caffeine on a frequent basis at all, minus sodas, and we’re talking about 16 fl oz. bottles or the cans (not sure about the fl oz quantity). Those sodas contain maybe about ~60 mg tops from what the label states, and I really don’t drink soda for the caffeine at all, whatsoever.

Anyhow, I rarely drink coffee because for one, caffeine tends to upset my stomach, leading me to have bowel movements and stomaches. I have gotten real twitchy from coffee before, and decided to take l-theanine with it, which helps stabilize my jitteriness to a certain extent.

I’m currently “tweaking” as I write this, after having consumed roughly a bit more than half of a can of Bang energy drink, which contains roughly ~300 mg of caffeine. I have experimented with nootropics by dosing caffeine from the typical 200 mg tablets, anywhere from 10 to the full 200 mg. By the time I reach the 100 mg+ threshold, it’s as if I have taken a microdose of Adderall or some other amphetamine derivative. Sometimes, I even get euphoria along with it, and the stomach issues I frequently get, tend to come more than 90% of the time.

I end up becoming overstimulated, restless, and I feel my heart possibly palpitating and pounding in my chest. Now for the important part, I have yet to consume 100+ mg for driving during the daytime, but rather at night or the later evening, when I’ve had a long day and need to drive later in the day. I notice a more than decent lack of focus while experiencing extreme energy and jitteriness, to the point where I actually end up not being as sharp, while believing that I feel “sharp”. I’ve read an article on a man who has received a DUI from caffeine, but toxicology reports were after his arrest, and I have yet to find any additional articles regarding stimulant oversensitivity and driving. 

For my own sake, I’d rather not experiment and there are many other circumstances and conditions to my particular experiences, but I was wondering if anyone else has insight on this matter?

mainly interested in how dmt, shrooms, acid, and ecstasy might affect me. 

have been in a severe depression for a few years now, but it was taken to a whole other level a few months ago- unlike anything i ever thought possible. 

i've done shrooms and ecstasy before-- and also was a massive pothead for a couple years in my mid-20's (now 29)--, but not while in this state. 

i think back to some of my trips on potent edibles and the idea of going to such a place scares the shit out of me. at the same time it also excites me because of how random trips can be. i know all the drugs i'm asking about are more potent than edibles on paper, but edibles in particular have always had an especially powerful effect on me, causing some of the most spectacular visuals and ideas. smoking pot, on the other hand, rarely does anything for me anymore as i really overdid it when i was in my pothead stage, smoking up to 12 massive joints a day. was going through an ounce a week, easily. tolerance became obscene. i stopped smoking about a year ago, only partaking once every few months now, but the effect is very mild now. 

i want to take drugs so that i can be taken away from my very grim reality, even if for just a few short moments. trips have always been a source of much inspiration- and knowing that such a place (as the one i experience in my trips) exists is reason enough for me to keep going.

I'm on here a lot so I didnt really learn much but I could tell it was good for some of the fellow users who are stupid.overall it was a very good class and I really feel like a lot more schools should be reaching for harm reduction over preventing people from starting in the first place.

This is my experience with acid and shrooms: 
I was curious of shrooms so I took about 2.5 grams and felt nothing but after I got more I had about 6 grams and like an idiot took all at once, I started to see lines behind my hands after a bit and knew it had kicked in but within about 5-10 min I got up and felt sick to my stomach and ended up laying on my back on the floor for about 20-30 min. I slowly stopped breathing because it felt like I didn’t need to anymore and I got tunnel vision until after a few minutes i got a large heart beat and took the breath of my life. After getting into bed shook af I didn’t sleep all night and on the way to college the next day I was in the car with my mom (cause I can’t drive because of seizures) and I took a breath that felt like it trapped a bubble in my chest and after a few moments I started to pass out in the car for a few minutes........ but that’s not all, cause I’m an idiot and depression got the best of me again, I started taking acid a few months later and got addicted to it. I started taking 1 tab a night then 2 a night until a few days later I was taking 5 a night. But after about 2-3 weeks I was taking 10 a night for about 2-3 nights and when I took 5 tabs at work on break I realized I had a problem so I called a drug help line a few times and the guy on the line was very helpful until he mentioned a rehab like center and I had to decline when he mentioned my insurance didn’t cover it and it would cost 15k😕 so I had to force myself to give it up. It was super easy for me to say no for about a month but then I had an extreme depression experience one night( which I normally have depression but not like this) I sat there and started thinking about suicide and started searching quick and painless ways to commit suicide.

19613,Deliriants,"""The lady"" on 1,100 mgs dph and 500 mg dxm I WAS TORTURED","IMPORTANT INFO: I am experienced with this drugs and yet it was a stupid choice, know what you are doing and be safe. Also I am a male, 24 and weight about 95 kgs.

So one day I was alone in my room and bored so I decided to do the magic dxm dph convo. 

I planned on takin 450 mg of dxm and 350 mg of dph to just keep things not too wild as I didn't have a sitter (I was home alone). So I always take the dxm first and I must add that I drank a lot of fresh grapefruit juice during the day. Right before the dxm peak I take the dph and they peaked at the same time (sorta) and ofc it was amazing. But thats not whats interesting about this trip.

So at some point, since I didn't hide my dph I began havin this thought loop in which I would get up and take a couple more 50 mgs dph pills to ""get it to 450"" and without realizin I took a lot more than I thought.

A few minutes after that I decided to ""get it to 500 mgs of dph"" but to my surprise the whole blister was empty and heres when I freaked out, I still had more dph but I had deff taken a lot and I wasnt able to know how much exactly.

And I didn't have any notion of takin more than two pills, turns out I got my dose to over a gram with a really low tolerance and dxm.

At some point I got out of a sea of never ending thought loops, and in my last moments of clearity I realized that even if I had taken the whole blister I was probably going to be okay (delirious thinkin cuz the whole thing was 1500 mgs but I didnt take more) i didnt manage to get back to my bed so I was layin on the floor.

Now I could try to grasp what happened next but there are no words, I was out of this world for hours that felt like ages.

I saw lots of entities, heard lots of voices. I heard my dad mad at me, my friends sayin I was a piece of shit it was trully a paranoia and psychotic attack. (Important to clarify, my set and settin were good, my life was going good).

At aome point I kinda calmed down, but I was so confused I was not able to think in the traditional linear way, my thoughts made no sense AT ALL,  I was in a enterely different room, i didn't know who I was, i didn't know anything at all and ofc I forgot I had taken any drug.

So gettin to the point because this is too long to read already. At some point someone opened the door of my room...  Ive seen people that are not there hundreds of times on dph right, but this one was even more intense and real... just different...

I saw a women Ive never seen before, she was beautiful but at the same time I was very very scared of her, I thought she was the devil but when she first talked, I remember I thought she was much worse than the devil himself.

Her voice was beautiful too, but I felt it go through my body a rip my organs apart... very VERY INTENSE. 

She was... the best way to describe it is like if she was using like spells to make me feel weird and suffer and she kept laughin all the time, she would destroy me with her voice and gaze and then do something to build me up again just to tear me apart over and over.

I physically felt the pain of her words, it felt so real... I was trully being tortured by this being. And at some point, after what felt like months of pure agony she said in clear English something like ""You are gonna have a rough time trying to put yourself back together after all of this"" she laughted and dissapeared, I think she kinda had a snake's tongue.. dunno.

And man I was so happy I was cryin... I was so happy she was gone. The rest of the trip wasn't pleasant either until the very end when it felt like the low dose trip I wanted. At some point I passed out thanks to some koppins and woke up fine, with a bit of anxiety.

I will finish this already long post saying that this is the only trip among all the trips Ive had on lsd, shrooms, dxm, weed and salvia that I consider a ""bad trip"". I am very careful with my set and setting and it's the first time I didn't enjoy not being in control, not only that... I suffered a long torture from this weird being (Is it real? I dont think so and I dont want to think she is real, but at the same time it also scares me how my brain was able to jist materialize pure evil and yet inside a beautiful woman)

Ive been havin pretty bad and wicked nightmares since the experience, I don't dream of her and I dont even remember her face now. But I am still gettin over this experience and it's been a while already... I also quit dph since and even tho I miss it..
 It does scare the shit out of me.

As we chased him and grabbed him dude went crazy “WHAT THE F*** YALL GONNA DO” all gangsta mood like if he didn’t know us, as we tried to tell him “we are here to help”he then passed out again for like the 10th time. We were so scared we were about to call 12. As we put inside again we put him in the chair only this time. He is whispering things, he looks possessed doing weird body moment like being stuck,  he then does a MEDITATION BODY LANGUAGE LIKE HOW MONKS DO and started to whisper sh^^. So I’m thinking to my self, is this even B? Is he in meditation mode and if so how ? Without any training?A hour goes by, we ask what is he seeing, he replies with a scared voice, “that....” What’s that we asked. “Idk...” so we are taking care of him giving him water, him doing weird ****,4:30ish I said a joke, B then starts to smile. We ask you good? He like yea why? As if nothing happened. “Are you serious ? 2 hours of all that and you don’t remember ? We asked if it was a good trip he said yea bc he didn’t remember any of that happened. Does anyone have a clue what went down ? I wanted to record but I was thinking about that, I was so scared I thought he was gonna die. I was thinking maybe when he went to sleep ? Mind you he’s done acid plenty of times, and I gotta give credit to J for not tripping. He’s good he’s acting normal, maybe ego death?

19623,Cocaine,My Girlfriend HAs Said I Have A 'Coke Habit'. I need help!,"My girlfriend has said I have a coke habit and need to get help.  I'm to sure what to do?

&amp;#x200B;

We have a big family of 5 children.  I have always paid all the bills (she has never worked up until recently where she works an hour a day).  It's a lot to deal with and recently work has been short so there is pressure on me to keep paying the bills.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a big house and a small mortgage now, and I've kept all of us going for 12 years without any complaints (I love my family and spend every minute I can with them). earning of approx £80k a year so no one ever went without (this is relevant to the coke thing).

&amp;#x200B;

Every now and again I dabble in a bit of coke.  If I'm out with the lads (which is rare as I always have the kids with me), I may go halves on a £25.00 wrap.  I don't drink too often, but when I do it's all for fun and when out with friends and their kids etc.  Maybe once of twice a week, or the odd pint after work with the kids etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Work has been reduced lately so it is a bit of a struggle, and she rightly thinks anything like this is a waste, but I am not a machine and we waste more money on takeaways (but granted those are for the whole family).

&amp;#x200B;

I may do a £12.50 worth, and then not go out for a week etc, but it is at least £12.50 every 2 weeks when letting my hair down. I don't ever think about it in between, in fact the only time I do is when she has a go at me about it?

&amp;#x200B;

We think I have a coke problem and need help, she raises it all the time and it's getting more frequent.  She keeps using the words ""coke habit"" and this is an awful phrase that is making me feel terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

As another note, she has never offered any praise for me keeping everyone in a house and nice(ish) life etc, she seems to wait for a bad thing to happen and that's all she talks to me about (the bad things - of which I think there are few).  This may be a bad thing without any excuse, but my point is I have never done anytign good in her eyes that she tells me about.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend all my time with my children as they are the love of my life. I work hard.  I am outgoing, never miserable (that's not my department....). I don't smoke or do any other drugs.  I'm home every night, I cook, help with cleaning etc, do football with kids, take them everywhere with me etc, so this is a small bit for me (at least thats how I see it, and perhaps I am just being selfish).

&amp;#x200B;

I am worried this £30 approx per month of coke per month is going to affect my girlfriend and me, as it is currently a big problem for her.  I can stop if this seems excessive, but wanted some thoughts to guide me.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

19660,Psychedelics,Lsdxm trip report - 300 mcg lsd and 450 mg dxm... plus killer weed,"So to add some context this trip occured on January first 2019, me and my friends wanted to ""give the year a decent stary"". Lets call my friends Dave and Kevin, so Dave and I wanted to give the lsdxm a second try but this time trying to make them peak at the same time. My friend Kevin just wants to smoke weed and take a 2nd plat dxm dose.

DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT INFO: This combo is a whole new level of intensity and no one should try it unless they know what they are doing and are experienced in both lsd and dxm beforehand.

I am a male, 24 years old and I weight about 95 kg, I have low tolerance to lsd because I don't take it often and medium tolerance to dissociatives (ket and dxm usage).

So first I will describe what was on the journal I was taking at the begining of the trip and then I will contruct the story based on my memory and what my friends told me (specially kevin since he was lucid).

00:00 We take 3 tabs each of tested lsd that we estimate to be around 100-125 mcgs per tab. 

00:30 We beging to feel the mood lift quite strongly, I want to get balloons for some reason?

01:00 The effects are starting to kick in, I see colourful halos around the points sun light lands. (Forgot to mention, we are at my living room). We decided to take 300 mgs of dxm (syrup) and then smoke a few bols and eat a few chips.

02:00 The acid is peaking and its really hars to think clearly. Kevin put a movie on but I have no idea whats going on, for I moment I thought I was part of the movie.

02:30 I feel the impulse to smoke more weed, by the way this was honey bananas strain, it's just amazing. Stupid me takes to huge hits and 10 mins later I am out if this world.

I can definately feel the dxm, mostly because the acid head space begins to slowly vanish, I kind of lose the acid ""change of perspective"" and get a more wicked headspace, but wicked in a goos way.

03:00 It's only been another 15 mins but it felt like ages, my friend tries to explain me what movie we are watching but I dont understand at all what movies are. Also my friend begins to turn into a raven-ish humanoid? Very cool but I started to freak out a bit so I stoped talkin to him and just tried to watch the movie.

For what felt like ages I was so into the movie I felt I was there, but it was something entirely different to what was actually going on in the movie. Turns out he decided to watch the movie ""Life"" YES THE ALIEN CREEPY ONE because he read somewhere it goes well with the weed strain? Ofc at the moment I had no idea of what was going on. The boundaries between the tv screen and the real world disapeared, I felt as if the characters were in the room... I also lost my concept of ""room"".

I can tell you, for those who haven't done the combo that it is very confusing, ego death is deep and pretty much inevitable... so be careful, also the lsd visuals kinda turn dark-ish, definately they're similar but the colors are not bright and you feel they're just... ""wicked but in a good way"".

I don't remember much detail of what happened next, but I kept going back to this idea of the universe consisting on tree ""gods"" and also tree ""dimensions"" like the low dimension is quantum mechanics and chemistry... the medium dimension is us and biology, the dimention that explores the others... and finally the upper one is the planets, logic, psychics... and ""empty space"". 

But this idea was everywhere, on patterns on the walls, in music, in the movie and even the trip itself... I ended up calling Kevin ""the god of nature"" because ""he does nothing beyond his animal being"" aka he lazy as fuck, and he also was the ""less high guy"" the my friend Dave was ""balance"", the ""God of balance"" as he didn't drink more dxm (forgot to mention at some point I drank 150 mg dxm) and I was the ""god of nothingness"" guess Imma cut the details here because you had to be there, if someones interestes I may make a new post...

During the peak of the experience I went through a very intense ego death. I had no idea of what anything was including myself. I put on some viking music and had amazing internal trips (imagine the serie vikings) with lots of raven-ish people and shit and fractals and indescribable things. I felt like time and space didn't exist and I could have sworn I discovered every truth about the universe but Kevin insists I was just laughing hysterically saying random words with no sense whatsoever.

I had lots of open eyed visuals of small people and rats (reminded me of a dph + dxm trip) and my friends kept morphing into whatever I thought they were... raven people, aliens, gods...

At some point we were to the park for a walk but I just couldn't follow then robowalking.

I loved that the lsd fixed the double vision of the dxm and the dxm makes the lsd less personal and you spend less time thinking about your life and more time enjoying the CRAZY hallucinations.

Everything had texture, everything was breathing, patterns on wals and some dark entities like hallucinafing ghosts or shit like that.

I'm sorry I can't get every detail here but this is a good sumary, around t+11:00 I felt almost back in reality but still Kevin had to force me to eat a bit and take 50 mgs of dph to help me sleep. It didnt help so I also took 2.5 mg of diacepam and just passed out.

I am open to questions and I hope you enjoyed the story or at least found it interesring  and if people seem to like my reports I will make more... got lots of notes from my salvia divinorum trips, ketamine, shrooms... I may even make some harm reduction posts or pharmacology ones.",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/agwox6/lsdxm_trip_report_300_mcg_lsd_and_450_mg_dxm_plus/

Of course, it didn't stop me from doing it again, so this time I had barely put the mushroom I'm mouth and I was already feeling like throwing up, and I did 2 minutes latter after I eat like 2g (I just wanted a nice light trip), and got again, a headache, not such a terrible one but still..

I think I'm allergic to it, I get the same thing if I get too much dairy, which I know I'm allergic to.

Last February, 2018, I was hospitalized with Myocarditis, essentially inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart caused by a viral infection (in my case from the common flu).

Doctors said that my heart was still very strong even right after the incident, and after a follow-up scan a few months later they concluded that my heart was fully functional, if anything slightly ""scarred"" but nothing that affects its function.

My question is, would MDMA be safe to take in my position? I'm aware it raises heart rate, but only by about 30bmp from what I understand, which is akin to moderate-heavy exercise. Something I can handle normally, especially since I quit smoking cigarettes last month.

I don't suspect anything about the MDMA itself, its from a reliable source and we plan to purchase a test kit tomorrow.

he didn’t have the best home life. he either dropped out or got expelled freshman year. i’m not sure if anyone knows 100% what happened. i’m a junior right now. he should be too and he deserves so much more than this.

20009,Dissociatives,Questions about DXM? Beginner..,"I've been contemplating experimenting with other drugs. Realistically the only one I've ever done is Cannabis in its many forms. I've been wanting to partake in Shrooms or possibly acid (I'm still too unclear to partake for the second one) ,but I'm currently a broke college student, and none of the dealers in town (my collective knowledge of all like 3 dealers)  carry either of these. The next foray for someone who can't procure drugs is to make some out of what they have. (When life gives you lemons) The spearhead of this idea is DXM, specifically Nyquil. I have many questions about every aspect and I was hoping you could alleviate some of my misunderstandings, misgivings, and misinformation. Thank you for your time and any responses. 


1) Is it dangerous? 
This is the biggest concern. I'm a very careful person by nature when it comes to unknown substances, and I just wanna make sure I'm not trying my brain with this. Is there a risk of death? (No matter how minute) Am I gonna get Olney's lesions on my brain? I'm using the worst case scenarios, but you get my point. 


2) is my phone a yay or a nay? 

In case something does happen, I wanna have my phone handy to call or text someone if something happens, but I also don't wanna trip-text my girlfriend or something. 



3) How should I dose? I'm aiming for in between the first and second plateaus, so I was thinking 150-175mg. I've heard that the Eiffel Tower does is at 7.5mg to kg, but I'm currently going to be closer to 2.5mg/kg.   (This corresponds to about half a bottle of Dayquil cough suppressant.) (Dayquil cough suppressant is one of the only ones that I've found that only has DXM.) 



4) Gaming? 

I was planning on playing The ESO, but I dont know how the trip is going to feel. (Would this be described as a trip?) In your experiences, is gaming on DXM fun? 


5) Thank you for reading this far. And thank you for helping a newbie.

So, all I know is the depressant and mild hallucination side of highs.

I'm wondering what its like to be high on something like Coke, compared to what I've been on.

I imagine you remember a lot more, and are very alert and anxious, but the closest I've been to that state is a ton of coffee and clearly that doesn't compare..

20023,Psychedelics,Story time fuckers!,"I am an avid fan of all psychedelics. 
Let me tell you guys a little story about the time an Avril Lavigne film clip made me throw up.

We were young at the time, it was myself and my 3 best mates at my house, I had recently brought 30 tabs and my one of my mates had never tripped before so we were like fuck it let’s do it.

We dropped a tab and a half each and just chilled at home for a while waiting for it to kick in. It was about 9.30 at night. Everything was great we were having fun so we decided to drive into town and see what was going on there. I know I shouldn’t drive on acid remember I was young and dumb. We were in town a while but it wasn’t too exciting so we decided to head home, by this point it had been a few hour we were definitely tripping, driving was much much more of an intense experience. We made it home and decided to drop another tab each. 

After a while things started getting weird we turned all the lights off and turned the music up we were laying on the ground together making a torch light dance to the music on the roof. 

Fast forward a few hours the sun starts coming up. We decided to venture out side. I should mention throughout this entire trip we were smashing come after come of weed. 
After watching the torch light spin around for hours anything I looked at for too long would start to spin. I wasn’t feeling great but I couldn’t communicate it to my friends. 
Once we got to the river the running water was deafening and it was just spinning around so I was like nah fuck the river and went to sit on a log at the car park near the bush, then the road started dropping away and making spinning mulitcoloured shapes. I was like fuck this, and started walking home, without saying anything to my mates, I just couldn’t get words out. 

They were following me quietly then I hear my friend (who’s first time tripping) say “it feels like Sesame Street is coming out of my mouth”.
I could not comprehend that. I ran home. 

Once we were back inside I sat on a recliner in the corner and all 3 of my other mates sat on the couch. I felt alone, but I also wanted to be alone. 
I turned on tv to a music channel, the film clip playing was walking on a dream by empire of the sun, the clip was way too colourful and sucking me in I couldn’t handle it, without saying anything I turned the tv off. 
My mates were like what the fuck chuck it back on.  I did but I changed the channel, next it was the fray cable car, that song is sooooo sad and dark, I turned it off. 

Again they were like what are you doing? Without saying anything I turned it back on. 
Next channel was playing Avril Lavigne when she sings it’s a damn cold night. All of a sudden when the camera panned in to her face it started spinning so fast and it was just too fucking sad I couldn’t handle it, I got up real quick and was trying to unlock the veranda door, I just got it opened and before I could step out into the fresh air I projectile vomited all over the veranda floor, I just shut the door and looked at my friends, I hadn’t spoken in hours then that happens, they all looked so worried, then my house mate says “you gotta clean that”

And we laughed and laughed then I went into my room and cocooned myself in my blanket and prayed to sleep just so shit would stop spinning. 

It sounds like it was a bad trip but it was definitely one of the most hilarious and memorable.

Lesson I took from that nice don’t do acid when your tired, Avril Lavigne sucks, work on your natural body clock and day tripping is the fucking best. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ah2gzc/story_time_fuckers/
20033,yourtexthere,Be careful who you hang around with,"So when I was freshman, I thought I was more grown than I was and used to hang out with people 20+ years old at the time. So I went to the kids apartment (he picked me up w/ his brother) and got down to the usual, smoking a ton of weed. Except this time was different, idk if it was the weed or if maybe I drank / did other drugs, but I had no recollection of the night at all. I just remember getting there and that’s it, but here’s why I feel the need to write this. There was a girl there (20+ at least) and she was heavy (or at least was) into coke, she’s OD’d multiple times, like dying and being revived. Ik I was hitting her bowl, which is a bad idea as here people will use bowls for everything. Either way, my friend eventually told me what went down when I left. I left with this girl, and apparently before she dropped me off, had sex with me. I truly have no idea how it went down, as me and that friend fell out of contact because of a situation. I never would have thought that something like that would ever happen, especially to me as I’m a male. People might seem nice, but don’t trust anyone, ik peoples who’s best friends be snitchin on em. You need to be careful who’s stuff your using, what your using together, who your using what with, you never know. Really don’t go out a whole lot after this experience as I can’t trust anyone now.

20091,LSD,Horrifying Acid Trip,"Within the past year I have becomed interested in physcadelics due to its potential to change your outlook on reality as well as adventure. After doing plenty of research and finally being able to obtain physcadelics, I tripped on 1.5 grams of mushrooms and then on a tab (supposedly 150 ug) of acid a month later. Both experiences I saw some cool visuals and overall had a good time. However, I failed to gain anything revelatory or experience anything mind blowing. The next trip, however, was different. The way I viewed the universe was about to change forever. 

Late December of this past year I obtained two tabs of LSD. Due to my current living situation, it is very hard to trip, as my roommates aren’t to keen with drug use. One day I was over at my buddy’s, who I’ll call F, house smoking, and I mentioned the tabs that I had obtained. He told me he was having guys night tonight and that I could stay over and trip. I was friends with all the people who were coming to his house and I knew I wouldn’t have another opportunity to trip in the near future, so I took him up on his offer.

Later that evening I popped the two tabs (supposedly 300 ug in total) and waited for the adventure to begin. In the meantime F had on some random movie. In total there was nine other guys in the house. About 30 minutes into the movie a faint kaleidoscope visual fleeted across screen, signaling the trip had begun. I became incredibly ancy to the point where it actually hurted. I decided to leave the movie room and look at his stairs because it had cool patterns on it. Apparently I was talking to the stairs for a full ten minutes. From outside the theater room, I could still here the movie, and there was a lot of gun shooting noises, stuff that would startle me. I decided to go into the bathroom so I wouldn’t here the movie.
In the bathroom I stared at the mirror. I was looking at patterned move across my face when suddenly I felt as if I was being watched. I looked down on the granite counter top to see that it was covered with eyeballs. It didn’t scare me or anything I just found that really cool.

Eventually about half the guys left, leaving me, F, and two guys who were drunk and too cheap to pay for an Uber. The two drunk guys wanted some food, so we all piled in F’s car. This is where the trip begins to go south. It’s 1:30am at this point and my asshole roommate calls me complaining that I left the light on in my room and that I’m going to have to pay extra on the next electric bill. I said ok but he kept being a baby about it and continued to text me. I shut off my phone because I was starting to get worked up. After this point, the trip had an off feeling that didn’t quite go away until the trip was over. For the rest of the car ride, F played trippy music and images and colors exploded in my brain. I was sedated by the visuals they were so intense. 

When we made it back to F’s house, him and the drunk guys went out to smoke. I sat there for what I could’ve sworn was two hours but was actually only ten minutes by myself. Time was all out of whack. When they came back in, they decided to go to bed, just as I had begun to peak. I couldn’t stop questioning everything on an existential level, so I decided to turn on the Maddy Smokes episode of Cody Ko. This is where the trip became awful. When I saw Maddy Smokes and his friend group on the scene, I immediately became horribly upset because I thought those four kids are better than me and that it is official (None of that even makes sense now, acid is so weird). When Cody Ko and his friend were roasting those kids, that’s when I had a relevation. How are any of these insults valid when we’re all just vulnerable humans that are confused and trying to figure out how to survive in a universe that is trying to destroy us? What do words like cool and land even meen. They’re just fabricated constructs made by humans to validate themselves. These thoughts shook me to my core. Everything visually would lapse in on its self, and I could see what it was lapsing towards-pure nothingness. I realized that everything in my life, the whole story, doesn’t matter because it will all disappear at anytime the universe wants it too. I began to think about all the lives that end in disappointment, those kids who die when they were supposed to grow old and have grandkids, those people who were supposed to find love but never did, those people who did have it all but then the universe killed them and ended it. I fell to the floor. I began to physically feel the pain of the world. A sharp, intense pain shot through every cell. I began to convulse uncontrollably. For what felt like an enternity, I crawled on the ground, dry heaving. It wasn’t until the trip began to where off that the pain mellowed. 

Although I had a very devastating and nilistic trip, that is not say that I didn’t learn from it. Ever since the trip, I know it sounds cliche but I have lived my life more fully, because the universe doesn’t give a damn about your expectations. I haven’t been reckless, but I’ve been more daring, trying new experiences that have taken me out of my comfort zone. I don’t plan things out as much. Why should I suffer through work and playing safe now so I could be happy someday? Why can’t I be happy right now in the moment when I know I still have a chance?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ah3c4w/horrifying_acid_trip/

He can go without ok, has a bit of a sleep but is generally his normal happy self except his motivation is shot. Even during the year off it he struggled with getting up and out of bed to get to work. 
This time we’re trying to taper off usage so that he at least can get to work.

We picked up a few grams, mind you we had both been on a tolerance break for a little over a week but didn’t think it would affect us too much since we’ve been avid smokers for the last few years...

We were completely wrong...

Usually it takes us about 5 or 6 bowls to get a good high but within 2-3 bowl we were fucked up (just smoking out of a pipe btw lol). We stopped at a gas station &amp; I went inside while my sister waited in the car. I was trippin hard &amp; she was trippin even harder starting to slur her words &amp; shit so then I started getting paranoid as fuck... next thing I know this bitch just straight passed out in her seat. At the time I didn’t put it together that she had just passed out I was over here thinking she was having a seizure, I started shaking her trying to wake her up but she wouldn’t wake up...

That’s when I decided to jump out of the fucking car &amp; start screaming “HELP! HELP! SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY SISTER!!!”(like a dumb high bitch😂).. by then I had about 4 different people rushing over to help and a few about to call 911. Then my sister came to bc of how loud I was screaming &amp; had no idea why the fuck I was screaming so she started trying to calm me down at the same time I’m trying to calm her down... then she started just THROWING UP on herself bc I had convinced her she had had a seizure....

20160,Psychedelics,"Psychedelics, ego death, stuck in loop","wow I don't even know how to begin this, I made a reddit so I could get some outside information/experiences that would help me justify how I felt last night. My friends and I, (group of five including myself), had just gotten ahold of some acid, I hadn't tripped in about a year, this was my fourth time. I've never had a bad trip, I've only seen someone have a bad trip and he immediately had went to bed once he identified it. I took a single tab of 200mg at approximately 4:16, we had taken a little walk with my best friends dog, things were feeling pretty nice around the one hour mark, we started to head back because the sun was very close to setting. 

&amp;#x200B;

The visuals started to kick in when we went into the ""dungeon""(room with multicolored changing lights). I recall the boys going to the store and coming back a little while after, to go smoke a GB outside. Thats when it really started to get weird. I had been noticing things that didn't seem to be quite right, like myself in the conversation fading in and out, I didn't want to tell anyone because everyone seemed like they were having a nice time, shouldn't I be too? The next few hours get a little hazy yet so vivid for me. One minute we were sitting on the couch and trying to log into my Hulu account and the next I was hearing only the first few words of each sentence over and over, I looked down at my phone and could not even realize what was in my hand, all I could hear or see were distant talking and the same movement we had been doing for what I'm sure was less than 10 seconds but I was stuck in that time frame, being played over and over, the more I heard the worst it became, at that very instant my brain convinced me that the reason I was feeling the way I was is because something had happened during the trip, that I could not see what had happened to me because I was re-living it, there were 3 places in the room that I had ""died"".

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like a ticking time bomb, I was getting so cold and could not breathe, I try and step outside to break the loop only to get trapped again. I don't remember getting between the 3 places I remember in the trip, but I remember where I had died and why. My last recollection is myself on a couch in a blanket watching planet earth, which seemed to be the only thing that took me out of that, as soon as I realized what had happened I gathered my things because it was time for me to go home, truly. I ingested the tab at 4:16 and seemed to be relieved of my unpleasantness around 10ish, which felt like I was stuck in an eternity of watching myself die over and over again. I have been informed by some of my friends that what I witnessed was my ""ego death"", but all I could see was my utter destruction in that loop. If I had known about the likeliness of this happening I could have definitely prepared for it and maybe even gotten a little more out of it other than terror. I know that some people are sensitive to different environments but I had dropped acid at a festival before, I thought this would be like every other time, I'm no new user to drugs, I have a pretty low tolerance but its because I space certain things out so I won't build up one to them, I have just never experienced anything like this before.

Months later I tried LSD with very low quantities to make sure to not live this bad experience twice. I took like 50ug and it was Okay but definitly not strong enough. I recently tried a little more (like 65/70ug) and had little visuals (especially when closing my eyes). And a bad trip again...

The first experience today was in the morning before sunrise after smoking and using my dry herb vape (I just had a T-break) and I saw a white dragon in the snow. It turned toward me and started moving its tail. I realized that it was two baby sheep, and had to check to make sure they were real. They were. I went inside seeing CEVs.

After I smoked a FAT bowl of bud and mostly ABV and used a chamber of my dry herb vape, I was slightly out of breath and my CEVs were intense for weed. Then, I looked at a rock on rock wall of a cliff about 1.5x my height and it kinda morphed. I walked to a bigger, flatter one and stared. I got closer and kept staring. I moved my eyes to the left.


There was a Darth Vader shaped whitish patch in the rock. I stared and stared. Eventually, eyes popped in. Simple enough, I get these in the dark. Cev overlays with open eyes. Eventually I heard whispers or something. I looked deep inside the rock, and I let my imagination do what it wanted. Aztec imagery appeared. Started small with figures of people, but eventually I saw symbols, spirals outward, patterns, 2d moving things across the surface of the rock. Very vivid. Some were menacing, some stared deep into my soul and wrongdoings, some wanted to show me. I started chanting ""Oh-men-ay"" to the rock, which powered the visuals. I heard a witch's laugh as a recurring auditory hallucination. There's so much more I'm forgetting.



That was cool, but **this is what made me write the post**. All the visuals stopped. I held onto the sensation and brought it back, intensifying the visuals past anything before. The witch laughed more and more. I saw so much I'm forgetting. Auditory hallucinations became frequent, and eventually the visuals were no longer 2d. I flashed back to my most recent nitrous experience, and my biggest success. I felt the same effects. Everything was warped, magnified, and I was zoomed into the wall. I felt light in the air. I got tracers, and I saw indescribable patterns on the wall as well. I can't believe I forget all this. I will add more when I remember more.



Edit: smoked ONE bowl and it happened again, on everything as last time. I actually holed. I zoomed back from my vision and only saw the one thing I was looking at. Again and again. Then my vision disappeared for a second. I got the nitrous experience effects again and also got the repeating cubes of vision. I got a hallway of repeated vision. And Darth Vader. More I'm forgetting too.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ah577c/didnt_really_know_this_was_possible_on_cannabis/

20288,Cannabis,Cop Made Me Eat Weed,"I just got a 25 grams brick from my cousin and got a chocolate blunt. went to the nearest park and i was very excited to roll it.

I cutted a piece from the brick and then i saw a huge black cop coming with a big fucking assault rifle with scope and everything. I threw the brick in the near vegetation and got just a small part of it in my stuff to say that was all i had. When the cops saw the piece they told me to eat it. I enjoy cannabis smell and stuff but not the taste. Specially on this kind of weed, bricks are often dirty.THEY RIPPED my BLUNT, took my CLIPPER (beautiful one tho) and made me throw all my eye drop's liquid in the ground.

After this, they released me and i waited in the backstreet for them to exit the place.

I ran to where my brick should have landed, found it plus my eye drops with a little bit of liquid in it.

I was so paranoid that i hided the brick between my ass cheeks and walked home.

At home trying to do my stuff without getting upset, hided my lil brick in my room.

At dinner i first notice my eyes getting red and me feeling some slight high sensation when suddenly i got too much high with red demon eyes and stoned talking to my mom and laughing about shit.

Stupid guy, made me eat weed thinking i would never smoke it again, but still it made me high as f\*ck!!!

Also, in one month, i did something like 5 whole nbome blotters, some trips alone and always smoking a lot of weed. I really noticed changes at my weed high and the only cannabutter that worked on me was after my first 2 nbomes.

20438,Cannabis,Recently started smoking weed,"So, over the last two or three years I'd smoke a little here and there, but never really got much into it. Mainly because of the horrible anxiety, as well as not having a source other than brother (except I only saw him a couple times a year). 

But I recently got a plug. He goes up to Oregon every week so this is medical quality. I stopped getting anxious, and I think that mainly had to do with set and setting, and how much I would smoke at a time.

The last two weeks I've smoked nearly every night. And it's starting to lose the novelty that drew me to it in the first place. Obviously I can just use more, but it still feels like something is missing. Will a tolerance break solve this?

20540,Psychedelics,Into the V O I D with Lucy,"This is a recount of the only challenging trip I ever had.  I say challenging because it wasn’t bad but it was difficult to exist through.  There was no fear or trauma throughout the experience save one brief moment.  This was approximately 9 months ago and it was my last deep dive with LSD since.  

(Ridiculously long read, I have a problem) I once knew this guy.  We’ll call him leechy fucking cuck boy for reasons I’ll probably never explain, also we’re going to call him Leech for short.  Leech claimed to know a chemist, Leech was also a narcissist and chronic liar, Leech usually got his LSD off of the dark web.  Leech was paranoid constantly due to near constant drug consumption of all kinds.  Uppers, downers, sidewaysers, it didn’t matter to him.  Due to this paranoia, the first time I tried to purchase a sheet from him he greeted me at his filthy little shack house by shoving 700 mics of LSD into my mouth.  Sure I could’ve spit it out but at the time I kind of liked him and I was willing to trip with him to prove I wasn’t a narc or some shit.  

Now for a little personal info.  At this late stage of my psychonaut career I am a bit of a freak about set and setting.  I spend weeks mentally preparing for a trip and the day of I usually fast, only taking water until nightfall where I eat a light meal, prepare my setting and then drop.  This guerrilla style trip put me on edge, especially since I was in a place I didn’t know that well and I hadn’t planned on tripping until the next day.  Ohwell.jpeg I said and tried to calm my breathing as I felt the come up hitting.

The discomfort was pretty strong, it felt like all of my bones had edges and were digging into my body, I was very aware of my rib cage and the soft organs beneath.  It wasn’t anything I hadn’t dealt with though so I kept cool and laid on the couch with my eyes closed.  About an hour in and I’m on a bullet train to peaksville, everything is passing by in a blur that I can’t comprehend.  Leech is constantly talking to me but I can’t really understand anything and I keep starting my sentences backwards so mostly I just listen.  

I don’t really know how long this lasted.  It felt like maybe 30 minutes but realistically I think it was closer to 3 hours.  At the end of it I was released for a few minutes into limbo.  This is where whatever the fuck God is begins speaking directly to me, could be spiritual but is most likely minor psychosis.  I prefer to believe the former.  So God inhabits Leech who hops up and grabs a guitar, he props one leg onto the couch and begins loudly playing and basically shouting “Craig Christ”.  I’m in absolute awe of the message behind the song and even though Leech breaks down into rambling nonsense by the end of the song I am reeling at the sheer beauty of humanity.  

Once the song was over God promptly left Leech and inhabited the Tv which was playing some commercial about eye exams.  I don’t exactly remember how the message was conveyed but I was specifically told not to get into vehicles driven by intoxicated people.  I filed the lesson away and was surprised when Leech became antsy and decided he wanted to go for a drive.  At the time Leech was on more acid than me and he thought repeating the alphabet backwards would convince me to go along with him but I consistently refused.  God inhabited me and I began a very weird conversation with Leech.  

As he opened the fridge to get a beer for the drive (!) I recognised something within him that I can’t really explain.  It was like understanding a person entirely without knowing anything about them.  We walked outside and Leech said something like “I’m going now” I followed with “I really shouldn’t” where he said “I have to” I said “I can wait” (him), “they’re expecting me” (me) “they’d want me to be safe”.  This weird little game continued for a while as we walked back and forth between his truck and then back into the house.  For a moment I thought I was winning him over, convincing him to stay but I watched him shake off whatever influence I had as he exclaimed that he was looking for a bottle opener.  

For some idiot fucking reason I grabbed the beer from him and used my teeth to open it.  Except I just broke the top off of it and sliced my lip open.  I can’t rightly imagine what I looked like to this man who was on at least 8 tabs as I held out a busted beer bottle with a blood stained smile.  Some reasoning part of me understood that I should make sure I wasn’t bleeding to death so while Leech freaked the hell out I went inside and found a dirty T-shirt to stick in my mouth.  The cut wasn’t that bad and the bleeding quickly stopped.  After making sure I was ok and making one final attempt at dragging me along Leech left in his truck.  I sat on the couch thinking how I had failed everyone everywhere and how if Leech killed anyone it would basically be my fault for not stopping him.  Thus began the plateau.  

I laid down on the couch and stared at the ceiling.  Uncomfortable.  I tried to start up ol’ reliable (trippy YouTube playlist).  Boring.  I went outside to see how beautiful nature was.  The air was incredibly dry and still, everything just felt entirely off.  I sat down on the porch and stared out at a barren field for at least an hour. Or maybe it was ten minutes.  Time didn’t make sense.  I looked down at the grass hoping for a crawling carpet of life but instead I became hyper focused on all the little empty gaps in between each blade of grass.  Some movement on the porch caught my eye, there was a grasshopper just sitting there, not three inches away from my foot.  Still, lifeless, disgusting, alien, unknown... my thoughts spiralled into visceral disgust for this tiny creature and I found myself wanting to smash it, to crush it into oblivion for no other reason than pure hatred.  I rushed inside trying to escape the damn thing and it’s stupid plastic eyes.  

The situation hadn’t changed inside, it was too cold, or maybe too hot.  The couches were cheap and uncomfortable.  It smelled like old beer and ashtrays in the house, drawing breath was like breathing molasses.  Yet despite all of this I felt nothing.  I couldn’t even try to reach out for emotion, I spent a solid couple hours staring blankly at the muted tv listening to the never ending hum of the window unit.  I closed my eyes hoping for some fractals or something to take my mind off of all the nothing but I was just alone, in darkness.  I felt my heart jump and I became suddenly terrified that I would be lost here.  I began panicking, I could feel my heart rate increasing.  I could feel it *tearing*.  “I’m having a heart attack and I’m going to die on this shitty couch.” Was my first thought before I realised I was just high and that I should calm myself before I propelled into some nightmare of a trip.  It didn’t take long, numbness crept back over me like some eldritch horror.  

I had never felt so alone before.  I looked around the room, at the blank white walls with no decoration, lit blindingly by fluorescent light (who tf puts fluorescent lights in their home?!) and I tried to cry.  I couldn’t, couldn’t even muster a half sob, my emotions were stunted.  I tried opening myself to the universe, inviting any number of things to come my way but I was met by a chorus of absolute silence.  God would not speak to me and I was surrounded by nothing.  

Leech didn’t come back until much later, I had been tripping for approximately 10 hours by this point.  I had thought his arrival would bring relief but it did not.  I sat next to him while he procured a baggie full of meth from his pocket.  I watched him smoke it with absolute apathy.  I had never even seen meth prior to this and I felt like I should be worried but I didn’t care.  He offered the pipe to me and I took it, wondering if I would even feel anything.  It seemed like everything happened in slow motion.  I watched the crystal vaporise and I inhaled.  I was expecting a taste but there was nothing, “how fitting” I thought idly.  Feeling nothing I turned to Leech and shrugged as I slowly exhaled.  He urged me to keep going so I did until suddenly *all* the dopamine hit my brain.  I leapt up, ecstatic to be free from the void, finally.  I chattered away with Leech for a good fifteen minutes but soon he became obsessed with his phone and began ignoring me.  I was alone again-so I smoked more meth. 

About two hours later I’m tweaked the fuck out for the first time in my life.  I’m constantly peaking out of the blinds, pacing around the house and cleaning whatever I can get my hands on.  But there’s no joy in it, no pleasure or fun, just distraction.  Hours go by and I can’t sleep (because meth) and I’m laying on the couch absolutely exhausted.  I refused to smoke anymore meth because I knew it would just keep me up longer and I wanted badly for this day to end.  As I lay there staring at the ceiling I began disassociating, the edges of my vision began to blacken and the ceiling seemed to be miles away.  I have no idea what it was but I felt like I was in a pit, alone, with no friends to call, no food, no emotion, and eventually no physical body.  I was only barely aware that I existed, I was floating somewhere in between the floor and ceiling when I finally, mercifully fell asleep.  

Integration: (you won’t offend me if you don’t read this but a few people have asked in my previous reports so I figured I’d include it this time)  This trip was the one that ended the reckless self medication of my depression.  I was viciously depressed and I relied on psychedelic use to “reset” the cycle and give myself a few weeks of release.   As you can imagine there wasn’t much of a reset from this trip, if anything it exacerbated my neuroticism.  This trip turned me away from psychedelics for a long time and without any sort of coping mechanism I quickly succumbed to a death spiral of suicidal intent.  It was due to the severity of that depression that I was finally able to go for broke and express to my family just how precarious my situation was.  On a whim they took me into a hormone therapy clinic and it drastically changed my life for the better in ways that would take another 5 paragraphs to explain.  Now I’m doing better than I ever thought I would and I credit that trip with turning me away from a semi effective but mostly incomplete method of coping.  I thought it was a cruelty at first but now I’m not so sure.  I find myself looking back and thinking about how unhappy I was even with the psychedelic use and wondering if maybe everything really does happen for a reason.  I’m not sure and I’m definitely not here to sell you a religion, I’m just here to write trip reports and hope you enjoy them.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ah7eb6/into_the_v_o_i_d_with_lucy/
20552,Cannabis,Is there anything milder than weed?,"No idea why, even a little bit of weed is uncomfortable for me. This is even with 5:1 and up CBD:THC strains, even with taking small doses with a vaporizer... I just don't like it.

Nicotine is a shitty drug in every regard. Alcohol is a bad idea given the level of alcoholism that runs in the family, and after quitting I can't have even half a beer without it triggering a panic attack two days later like clockwork.

I guess I'm looking for an afternoon enhancer that actually works without major side effects, major addiction risks, major costs.

20603,Cannabinoids,My first experience with edibles,"Yesterday I bought a 100mg edible from one of my friends. I have never eaten one although ive smoked a lot. Anyways, I got home and ate about a quarter of it ~25mg. 

I decided to lay on my couch and wait for it to kick in. About 45 minutes later i start to feel something. The first hour or so was really enjoyable, I was just watching Netflix and enjoying being high as fuck. I started to get the munchies and decided to make some soup that looked really good. I made it and ate it in about 2 minutes. 

Everything was fine until I started to feel a little dizzy, this is about the point where everything went downhill. I went to the bathroom to wash my face off and drink some water in an effort to calm my self down. I sat down and i started to get even dizzier and my stomach started feeling uneasy. I went upstairs to my room and laid down trying to take my mind off how shitty I felt.

Suddenly I had this urge to vomit, but it was different from other times. It was like I could feel the blood flowing out of my brain and it was going down to my stomach and trying to force everything out. I ran (stumbled) back to the bathroom and started drinking water straight out of the sink. Then I threw up. I've always had this irrational fear of throwing up so I was trying to force it down as much as possible but it wasn't happening. I threw up so much I nearly filled the small sink. I didn't really know how to clean it up so I just turned on the water and sat on the floor. 

After I sat there for a couple minutes I decided I needed to get back to my room. I couldn't stand up so I crawled back to my room. I started to get the urge again so I sat against the wall trying to force it down and called my sister to bring me water and a towel. I couldn't keep it down so I quickly threw up against into the trash can. I drank some water and cleaned myself up a little and laid down to sleep. I felt fine in the morning.

About an hour later I decided to pre roll a few blunts for later in the week (generally I take several days or week breaks after a while.) and smoked 3 of the pre rolls, the first one was smoked and I waited until about 2 hours had passed from smoking, and took 1mg of Klonopin during that timespan, while picking up Tums for later, And proceeded to smoke the other 2 back to back just now. Currently I am incredibly baked. And I begin to insulfate 30mg of Adderall, and wait a little while for the second.... 

Updated Effects: As the lines went into my nose, Incredible euphoria with an intense rush. Still fried but beginning to speed hard, went outside to smoke half of a blunt immediately after snorting, now with everything in full effect, specifically at this point Weed and Amphetamine.

20725,Cannabis,Weed after and combined with LSD,"I know its pretty common for LSD to make weed more psychedelic, but I don't seem to find people with similar highs to mine. 

Whenever I get blazed my vision seems to lose opacity. I can see black behind the pixels that form my vision, it sort of shimmers through in patterns. I always get this effect when I get high lately. 

I have trouble chilling out when high because of this, given that this whole thing is very overwhelming. I wouldn't call it a bad trip because I am always able to keep my cool &amp; roll with it, but the experience just isn't enjoyable. 

I have smoked on LSD trips, and the effect is exactly the same only a lot stronger. It just puts me in this overwhelming sensation and forces me to endure it until it kind of wears off. It is almost like my brain is trying to solve impossible problems and I cant do anything but sit through it. It feels like my consciousness is trying to observe it's self, resulting in an infinite paradox.

20759,I :love: Drugs,"Been a fairly heavy drug user, this is my funniest so far.","So lets get to it, it was around 9pm me and my buddy got a crate of 12 beers between us. He didnt know i had got my hands on some pure codeine pills 30mg, had around 7 i think. Anyway i didnt tell him till we was a few beers in cos hey everyones eaiser to persuade when drinking. So he popped 2 straight away and i did 3 cos i had done it before and others like it such as tramadol etc. I started drinking alot more when i felt them coming on and we started to get some bongs going whilst watching netflix we had about 2g of some nice stardawg. After about 40m of smoking shisha and bongs we decided to drop another 1 each, around 20m later dropped another and we held back on them as of now cos thats 4 already and it was only around 12am so after some spacing out and chatting nonsense for awhile we started to run low on weed at this point so its late and we wasnt able to get anyone to sort us that was close by to his house. So we had co pletely ran out and for some daft reason we got a hold of some lad about 5-6 miles away and it was some banging stardawg like we had. We was wanting some for morning and bevause we was high as fuck we decided to walk it.. just before we set off we dropped another 1 and half each and was empty then. It was quater past 1 we set off at night, we had plenty of tobacco and water etc but at the time we thought it was a good idea bare in mind it was only getting 10 bag. We got half way there and im like so fucmed im reallywanting to call a taxi. So i did but in my mind i thought i said something fine but listening to the call when he ended the call i soome how said 'please come help me i really need a taxi i will send you my gps i have 10 pounds' this dude just cuts off lmao so we had the choice of walk back or just get it done since we was there so we did. Got outside the store we was meeting him at. It was like 3am and we had to wait 25m for him to get here so us being fucked out our brains i fell asleep outside this huge tesco supermarket and shit you not had a right sleep haha but freaked me out cos i woke up exactly as he was coming towards me on his bike around 30meters away.

Now the walk back begins after abit of sleep im feeling less drained and we got to where we called the taxi, and layed down for 5m my friend fell asleep for fuck sake so i wake him up and im like we gotta go dude. He gets up and the walk back always seems faster in my opinion, we get home about half 4 and my girlfriends in my friends house just chilling on the sofa like where the fuck have you been and i told her cos couldnt lie to her and she said what if i wanted to come?

Then it hit me. I remember she went to sleep just after 9... she wasnt happy but when i showed the stardawg she soon forgave lol. At the time i thought it was a stupid idea and it was but thinking about it, its so funny just imagine if he didnt turn up and we wake up at like 7am with shoppers everywhere with trollies and shit and we would be there passed out.

If you ar looking a substitute for MDMA this is for you. I feel an indcredible euphoria (higher than M), the body high was out of this world, feeling orgasm all over the body, the level of conection whit the music was very high, I could speek with other people easily and with a clear head espace. The visuals were strong but not overhelming, and dancing with the eyes closed transported me to other dimesions.
For last, the crash was far away better than MDMA despite I was 8 hours dancing...

About a week or two later he told me he was trying to get messed up and do lsd and shrooms, he took about a tab and 50mg of some 4acodmt. Now he tells me he's trying to do it again a week later. My friend always seemed like he needed an escape from reality sort of speak, because to me at least, he always seems to be smoking weed whenever he gets the chance just because he can, and even though I dont have a problem with weed as I smoke it myself, he does it just because he's bored, and lsd showed me I was using weed as an escape from reality a couple months back.

I took 5mg Valium (Prescribed) as I had a stressful situation I had to deal with this morning (~9am) and my doctor told me to take 5mg if my anxiety gets really bad.

I was gonna have some drinks tonight starting around 7:30pm, maybe around 10 (approx.) units with friends but you know how it is youre not counting units when youre drinking.

I've heard horror stories about stopping breathing while drinking on valium, however I've seen a lot of people say its overblown and it's not like Im taking them in the same timeframe, and I'm not taking the valium recreationally. I also checked a drug interaction site and it didn't list death as a side effect of mixing these drugs. However I have always been a sleepy drunk and really struggle staying awake while drinking - could this facilitate the stopping breathing issue?

I'm also on 30mg of Mirtazipine per night to help me sleep, however I often don't take it if I've had a drink because after drinking Im out like a light.

20863,Psychedelics,"In Virginia, prepping for my first psych trip. What do I do?","After a ton of research, I'm about to take the plunge and try psychedelics. I'm not interested in recreational value, but rather their ability to help anxiety issues. I have a friend that is willing to learn how to be a guide (or at least a sitter) so I'm not worried about doing something stupid. 

Now, the problem is that I'm still in school. For the moment, I live with my parents, who are usually pretty open minded, but have a no-tolerance attitude when it comes to drugs. My dad is also a former LEO. I'm pretty close to my parents, so I would really like to keep this to myself. Another complication is that I live in Virginia. In addition to having ridiculous sentencing laws, a number of rc psychs are also illegal here. So, what do I do? I have never taken or bought any illegal drugs, and I have 0 social connections that could lead me to a dealer in person. 

Based on my research I would prefer psilocybin mushrooms, but anyway here's what I got:

1. Order mushrooms off the dark web and take the risk of it being found. 
2. Wait until spring and try to find mushrooms outdoors; try not to get poisoned.
3. Drive out of state to Maryland, where I could realistically have some 1P-LSD, AL-LAD, or 4-AcO-DMT shipped to me through the USPS pickup program (1P-LSD and AL-LAD are explicitly S1 in VA). 
4. Take the risk of ordering 4-AcO-DMT through the clearnet, even though I'm not sure it's legal (code of Virginia mentions that ""AcO-DMT"" is prohibited, not sure what that means).
5. Make a crude Ayahuasca brew with legal plants.

Any recommendations?

Help?,"Background: I am 2 years older than this kid and he is a senior in the very Catholic high school that we both grew up in. I am a sophomore in college now and started smoking early in my freshman year. Back in high school, the teachers taught us that it's incredibly addictive, can kill you, is in your system for months to years etc. Pretty much every stigma you can think of, this kid fully believes in.

I don't even consider myself a stoner because I only smoke twice maybe 3 times a week. I usually ignore morons who think weed is dangerous but I would consider this kid one of my best friends, and this little argument is affecting our friendship drastically.

I have tried everything from showing him scientific research, to easily consumable youtube videos. All of this is rebutted by ""you know these videos are made by druggies to make drugs look good"" followed by ""you lie to yourself so much about weed.""

20916,Scumbags-R-US!,Sleep in Alley on NEW YEARS,"It was January 1st 2018. I had just moved to LA after a bad breakup. I knew today was the day I got back in the game. My friend Chaz calls me and tells me about a few parties. One is in Hollywood and a few were in Echo Park. I pre-game with a few friends I was staying with in Silver Lake then I got meet with Chaz at his house. 

We link up at his house and decide to go to this mansion party first. I knew was a hit or miss based on Hollywood lame ass socialite scale. We get to the mansion and it’s packed. Cars everywhere and people lined up all going to the same place. We get to the front door of the house and I knew it was over for me once I saw security. Security at a Hollywood house just screams “only pretentious dickheads are getting in” and I wasn’t wrong. 

The guy at the door is giving me a hard time. I’m already drunk and known for causing a scene. I ask my friend if I should start some shit. Let’s be honest I was embarrassed who wouldn’t let me in in front of all these people. My friends begs me to just chill out so I do. Chaz isn’t a confrontational guy. Chaz calls a female friend of his that’s inside to come get him. He’s screaming into the phone over the loud music blaring. It’s beautiful/ugly pencil shaped model looking rich bitches getting let in passed me during all this. I felt so small. 

The female friend finally comes, but she says it’s a commotion because a certain “celebrity” showed up and everyone is trying to get in. Fuck celebrities 😤... she proceeds to tell Chaz she can only get him in, because nobody here knows me. It’s New Years and Chaz really wanted that girl so I told him to go ahead and check it out I’ll stay outside and try to find other moves. Plus I had a flask filled with tequila in my pocket. I wasn’t tripping.

I wait outside near the road where more and more people are coming. It’s a lot of pretty girls with no guys and I’m drunk so I try to make due with the situation. I start trying to talk to some of the girls by flirting and being talkative. A few girls respond some even stop to talk but none reciprocated the flirtatious vibes I was giving off. This hurt my confidence. I keep drinking out my flask. As a southern guy, I hate LA girls... bet if I offered some coke they’d wanna talk.

Chaz finally comes back and I’m pretty faded at this point. He has the girl with him and she has a friend. I’m too drunk to tell if she’s cute or not but I didn’t care I wanted to have fun. We take a Uber to a smaller house party with regularly cool people. On the way there I try talking to the friend to catch a vibe and see if she’d be interested in me. She gives me a cold ice vibe instantly. I never get upset about those things I just move on. I’m not an unattractive guy and I never have problems getting woman usually so I don’t trip.

We get to the party and it’s not even packed. It’s maybe 30-40 people. A lot of weed smoke, cigarette smoking in the back yard. Some dweebs are doing Karaoke in the living room. There’s no fur coats just a lot of normal shitbags. Felt like a dive bar. Perfect place for a scumbag like me. There’s instantly a girl there that catches my eye. She had a demeanor a lot like mine. She was really talkative and had slight hint of asshole sprinkled into her body language.

She looked Indian and black. She had a gypsy outfit but with pink grudge accented clothing with it draped over her very skinny body. I thought it was amazing. She had tattoos on her knuckles and a red dot on her forehead I noticed while she was smoking a cigarette. I struck conversation with her and we seemed to had hit it off. The conversation was pure sarcasm and we just started joking about everyone’s outfits at the party.

She’s tried to read me telling me she thinks I look like a wild boy. Knowing I am stayed in a modest lane. She’s touching me and giving me all the signs that she’s into me. We even take a drunk selfie video for her Snapchat. She puts her cigarette out in her hand. Just out of random boldness I lick her hand. She was amazed at how shitty I was. Conversation continues and I don’t know how but we got into the conversation of fighting. She says I look like a fighter. I tell her she does too. The conversation turns into me betting her that I can take a punch to the face from her like it’s nothing. We’re both laughing but we were serious.

A little crowd starts forming around us and her friend starts recording. I perk my face out and tell her you got one chance. She winds up her fist and clocks me in the chin pretty hard. Wow. This girl can hit. I’d been in so many fights though it didn’t effect me. Everyone at that party is ecstatic. She’s laughing and saying oh my god. She comes and hugs me and kisses me on the cheek, I jokingly say “my turn” but the night moved.

I had totally forgotten about Chaz and the other 2 girls, because this girl had me in a trance. I didn’t even know her name. We stay outside alone talking about our lives and a bunch of shit we won’t remember in the morning. Chaz comes out with the 2 girls and saying he wants to go home , I tell him I want to stay. He says he already called the Uber. I would’ve let him go without me but I was really broke after the break up and my phone was off so I couldn’t call a Uber myself. So I went with him.

The whole Uber ride I’m upset. I keep thinking about the girl and how that it would for sure be a missed connection. Not realizing I’m saying all of this out loud the cold shoulder girls looks to me and says “You’re an asshole” I was so confused. Me and her argue , and I’m telling her how am I an asshole if you gave me the most uninterested vibes and I just left you alone. Chaz had tried to set us up and it tried with you but you shorted on me. Chaz interrupts and says “bro if you want I’ll call you an Uber back to the party for that girl, but you gotta find a way back” and like the dumbass I am I take the offer.

I get out the car and a new Uber comes to pick me up. I get back to the party, go inside and what I saw makes me eligible for the dumbass of the year award. The Indian Gypsy Punk Girl was kissing this guy in the hallway. Not even cute kissing. They’re swapping tongue and his hands are literally down her pants and she’s rubbing his dick outside the jeans. Fuck man I had only been gone for like an hour and a half. I’m fucking 24 at the time. Who goes through this kind of shit at 24. This shit happens to 17 year old high schoolers at prom, not fucking ME!?

I take my loss with a grain of sat. I say fuck it imma just drink as much of their liquor as I can and pass out on this random persons floor wake up and deal with it tomorrow. The night is winding down anyway people are passing out all over this girls house. Suddenly I here a lot of noise coming from the back. Apparently the girls roommate had got into with some guy there and she storms into the living room yelling for everyone to get the fuck out. Fuck... I’m poor. My phones off and idk where the fuck I’m at.

Everyone starts leaving and getting into their cars. I don’t know any of these people. I start asking people for a ride or to even use a phone. I guess my asshole karma is kicking In because nobody gives a fuck. I had a genius idea to look at the map on Uber app on my phone to guide me back to silver lake as long as I walk in the right direction. It’s 4 am and I start walking. An hour goes by an I realize I’ve only covered maybe 30% of the walk. Fuck. Here’s the kicker, I check my phone battery and it says 10% 

I’m too drunk to even comprehend what’s going on and I don’t know my way back to the house I came from, my best idea was to RUN! I literally sprinted in the direction of Silver Lake trying to beat my phone battery from dying. I’m an idiot.
It’s now 5am my phone is on 3% and I can’t even run anymore. My legs won’t let me. I catch my breathe and let reality of me sleeping outside sink in. I’m drunk and exhausted.

I find a nice secluded alley way to lay down in. I see a concrete parking block I lay my head on. I take off my coat and ball it up to use as a pillow. This sucks. I fall asleep for maybe 10 minutes but I wake up out of paranoia. I look around me and see a forklift in the distance behind some building. I go to it and luckily the door was unlocked. I crawl into forklift and lay on the cushions. Not luxury but it’ll do. I turn my phone off hoping that 3% battery will help me in the morning, iPhones can be assholes sometimes. 

I wake up the next morning to full blown daylight. At first I was confused like where the fuck am I. I instantly remember my idiot night. I put my coat on and as soon as I get up to hop out the forklift a worker comes out the building what I soon find out to be a coffee shop in a apron holding a tray of some shit I don’t know. He sees me and freaks the fuck out , I just know realized how sketchy this looks. He runs back inside yelling in Spanish and I yell “sorry” and run off before any trouble occurs.

I run across and down the street to a smoothie shop. They for sure have WiFi. I turn on my phone in hopes that 3% can save my life right now. It works! I connect to the WiFi and FaceTime audio call a female friend of mine that I knew would come in a split second for me. I would’ve called Chaz but he doesn’t have a car and my phone would’ve died while he was calling me a fuck up. I look at my clothes and I looked wrecked. There’s back marking all over my coat and blue jeans. My once white were slaughtered from the running I did. The female friend of mine picks up I tell her I have no time to explain and to please come get me. She agrees and I share my location. 

She takes me to meet Chaz at the house we pregamed at. I come in looking like the night before and Chaz asks “bro what the fuck happened to you” while I’m getting ready to take a shower I tell him the whole story of my entire night. Can you guess what this motherfucker said to me after i told him?! ....”I don’t believe you”

20950,Dissociatives,I shit my pants on a DXM trip last night,"Last night I took DXM for the first and last time. 

I was alone and I had done dissociative drugs before so I figured I'd be alright. WRONG

I drank the whole bottle of cough syrup at around 7:00pm (that fucking shit should be illegal just for its taste) which was around 750mg. I believe this should've been a Tier 3 trip.

So an hour goes by, still not feeling much when suddenly, my belly hurts. And it HURTS, I felt like I was dying just there, but little did I know, this was only the beginning. I was starting to feel a little nauseous but nothing I couldn't handle, I thought to myself.

Now I wasn't enjoying this at all, I was getting more and more disoriented and confused, but mixed with the nausea and belly ache I regretted not simply smoking a bowl and going to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

*And then it happened*

&amp;#x200B;

The nausea wasn't going away and I suddenly had the urge to throw up. I got to the bathroom as fast as I could, but walking was pretty fucking hard at this point. 

My knees dropped to the floor in front of the toilet and I threw up like never before, then Mr.PooPoo came to say *Hello* and I shat myself. I got into the shower still fully clothed and just sat there under the water for what felt like an eternity, puking maybe every 5 minutes and shitting myself a bit more every once in a while, wondering what the fuck went wrong in my life that led me to drink cough syrup and lay in my own feces and vomit.

I'm not proud of this. Mom, if you ever read this, I'm sorry.

TL;DR : Took too much DXM for first trip, I shat and puked all over myself

Edit : Thanks for the support and advice, it does make me feel slightly better to read similar reports. The day after the experience I had the worst hangover but today I actually feel great, almost euphoric.
I guess all I really needed to have a positive afterglow was to crap my pants. Go figure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",418,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahdq3u/i_shit_my_pants_on_a_dxm_trip_last_night/
20984,Cannabinoids,I think I suffered from a Cannabis induced Panic Attack last night," 

smoked  a small piece of weed and took ibuprofen earlier in the day and when I  smoked this weed for whatever reason prior and after smoking I was  worried that I would develop a mental illness and be trapped in a  psychotic state forever because the previous day I read an article that  said cannabis can cause serious mental illness. And the more the THC  kicked in the more worried I became until I checked my blood pressure  and it read very high 170/114, I knew something was wrong. This issue  happened 10 minutes after smoking the weed, I was so scared it felt like  my heart was about to explode. I should also note I fell down in work  earlier that day and hit my chest very hard which is why I took the  ibuprofen earlier that day 6 hours prior to smoking the weed, other  symptons I got was extremely dry mouth like you wouldn't believe, I  forgot how to breathe my body wouldn't do it naturally and I was unable  to burb because my body forgot how to burb. Since then I threw out all  the rest of my weed and swore to never ever smoke weed again even if it  becomes legal.

PS: During the first 30  minutes I could hear a wolf barking and clawing away at my brain, very  dark and scary moment in my life, I hope nothing is permanent as I feel  97% better today but not 100% as yet. I was a huge advocate for  marijuana but never again, I won't try to prevent people from using it  or hamper its legalization however I will never touch it again.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahe7j9/i_think_i_suffered_from_a_cannabis_induced_panic/

I enjoy it immensely while playing video games, guitar, and even reading, but this past week literally every time I smoke any amount, I end up having an uncontrollable panic attack. It starts off as just weird tightness in my chest then progresses to a painful tightness followed by dizziness.

The anxiety appears out of thin air. I could be watching Netflix laughing with my roommates, but the second that I take a hit of a joint or anything, the tightness starts. They usually like 30-45 minutes and the first time I got one, I ended up calling 911 because I thought I had a heart attack. Luckily the operator calmed me down and explained that it's most likely a panic attack and no ambulance was needed, but dude, THEY ARE SCARY. You start to think that something is happening in your body that could kill you and ever little thing becomes a big thing and only contributes to the anxiety

21054,Psychedelics,I find that the best trip sitter is using the language barrier,"I know this sounds strange but I find myself taking comfort in changing back in forth between tongues while at different parts of my trips, it has this unreal smooth and natural feeling that sort of comes to you as a wave down your spine that feels like relief but also increases your ego along with it. I can’t compare it with anything else other than being on a “roll”😆 while gambling, it’s simply amazing to be able to slide yourself into emotions you feel would be the top shelf ones for that situation.

Then of-course my favorite, is playing on the pronunciation of certain words and translating them to where they sound funny or mean something funny that is completely irrelevant to the actual other definition.

Always made myself think of the language barrier as being the fountain of youth the conquistadors were looking for in South America.. it just makes sense to me.. (cause the never actually “found” it, they just slaughtered everyone.) And I have also find this profound intrigue in the Nazca lines down in Peru that is awkwardly relieving..

I live back alone in Europe now after being raised in southern USA for 12 years and I find the diversity of people all around to be awesome here, I can punctually just use either French, English or Spanish (only ones I know fluently) wherever I choose and be greeted back almost immediately in that tongue. I find that festivals here are really something else compared to what I’ve been to in America (buku,counterpoint,bonaroo..etc), they make me feel more in touch with others and I can open up about a lot more things depending on the person which opens up a huge potential for adventures 😁

I'm really not joking I told all that happened in a past post and people started downvoting it and being very rude.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ah5cvi/cop\_made\_me\_eat\_weed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ah5cvi/cop_made_me_eat_weed/)

A cop here in Brazil forced me to eat my weed. I got home, really affected by what happened.

YES i know raw buds don't give you any high because THC-A isn't active right?

I tried eating raw cannabis before and it didn't worked. Also, i've tried making cannabutter without decarbing a lot of times and none worked. After doing some nbomes i really felt the post effects like HPPD or feeling a little more dumb but nothing to worry about.

WELL, after \~\~1 hour i started feeling weird and looked at the mirror and my eyes were RED. I couldn't believe i was getting high and was hoping it to be a placebo.

I started eating dinner with my mom when i felt my eyes really fucking heavy and started observing my mental state and weed like effects. I started to get slowed down and laughing, being very open to my mom but getting contradicted in some ideas. I looked at the mirror again and well fuck, i was very stoned. I started laughing and saying:

\- ""stupid cop thought i would never smoke again after eating this shit but instead it got me even more high!""

i used my notebook and started telling some friends what happened, and every time i remembered everything i started laughing as fuck. I walked home with a brick of weed in my ass. And it repeated over and over until i layed on my bed.

The walls were moving strongly (usually my hppd make it happen all time but this one was another level of it, almost a flashback)

I saw some eyes blinking in the walls and when i closed my eyes i saw other people's eyes appearing randomly very fast like a thousand of pictures of all kind of eyes being showed up very fast.

I masturbated very pleased by my strong weed orgasm.I have no reasons to lie here and i ain't looking for bullshit too, so i wanted to know what you people think about it.

I already told my friends a lot about decarbing weed before eating it and even i would call someone a liar but today, i am the person to be doubted so there is nothing i can do unless count on good people. thank you",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahgmg7/im_not_a_liar_and_i_got_high_from_eating_normal/

I've been a pot smoker for 4 years and used LSD every now and then for one year. I almost always had a good time and it was overall fun while I was high, except when it wasn't.

I'm a depressed person. I tried to make dugs be my getaway from all my problems, but they only made them worst.

I lost the love of my life because I was not strong enough to stay off weed. I had actually quitted for 6 months but I never planned on making it a long term thing, and I thought I could convince my SO that smoking pot regularly wasn't a bad thing. I still think it is not bad, but it definitely isn't worth it for me and I've come to realize this very late. I put drugs and having a good time on top of my priorities and that caused me to break up with someone that loved me like no one has, because she wouldn't accept who I thought I was. And now I'm facing the consequences of my actions.

I'm working on becoming a better person for myself, and hopefully she will see that I can actually make a change in my life and we be together once again. But even if it doesn't work, I'm truly done with drugs. They've caused me more pain than enjoyment.

I still support legalization and if people are ok using drugs then I respect their decision. Drugs are cool, but they're not for everyone.

21396,Methamphetamine,Meth Addiction is Completely Fucked,"I'm a recovering meth addict. One year sober. For most of the past year I've spent a lot of time reminiscing on my meth days with euphoric recall if not outright craving. In general I've tended to think of meth as something good in the moment, that has horrible long term consequences, but I'm now starting to revise my opinion on that. What happened was I re-opened my 'camera roll' on Windows (the place where camera shots and videos are automatically stored), and found some old pics I'd taken during my meth days. Revelations include:

* Photographic proof that I DID in fact look like a stereotypical tweaker with sunken in cheeks and tons of scabs. At the time I was adamant that I didn't look weird at all.
* Short video clips of me staring into the camera like a zombie for no apparent reason.
* Pics of me making weird, creepy, menacing faces.
* Porn-ish images I thought were hot at the time, but were in fact completely disgusting.

Basically my photographic 'paper trail' from my meth days paints a picture of a person who's just completely unhealthy and insane. There's a strange, eerie feeling to each and every single one of these images, like you can see in the person's eyes that he's totally nuts. I'm really starting to think that what meth does is just basically put you somewhere on the edge of schizophrenia and the early euphoric stage is just one where the break from reality is not so far gone as to become scary (to you in the moment I mean--you probably do look scary to random observers even then).

21582,I :love: Drugs,Pre-ingestion safety checklist.,"Here are the things I think are most important to check before you take any substance. Please add your own steps to the comments.

What are your taking?

Do you know if you actually getting what you were sold. Please buy a test kit if possible. But I know many of you won't. So please use sites like the drugs.com pill identifier. That anyone who uses persription pills, should use. 

How much are you taking?
Yeah, I know. This is just the same shit youve heard hundreds of times. But you'd be surprised how easy it is to get lost in a high. And redose thoughtlessly. And end up blacking out, or dying. 

Make sure you have an empty or organized schedule for the duration of the drug. And it's potential comedown. This way it's a much calmer and stress free time. 

Set a limit. This is extremely important. If you don't set a limit. Your likely going to go overboard. And end up getting using more,losing money. If you fallow the limit strictly, your much less likely to form a habit.

21649,Diazepam,30mg Valium disappointment,"I had 30mg of Valium alongside about 5 cans of larger and a small amount of vodka and felt virtually nothing, maybe I was going into this with the wrong mind set thinking the Valium would have a profound effect which I did not experience. The initial feeling, before any alcohol consumption, was how I expected, a heavy body/eye feeling and a relaxed mind how ever it did not progress from this. Me and my friend were hoping for a little more than this feeling, hearing so much about the effects of Xanax and benzos as a whole, what would be the recreational dose of diazepam recommended since the dose we were suggested (35mg) did next to nothing for us. We were thinking 60mg maybe  a decent dose for next time. I saw no reason for one to become addicted to such a drug and don’t understand the so called ‘hype’ around it. Thanks 👍🏻

(Keep in mind that alprazolam (Xanax) is not readily available in my area and is not an option however I have heard that it has a more euphoric feeling and maybe what I looked for in Valium. I am also unable to smoke bud at this time due to pressures from work and is as so out of the question, I am mainly looking for an alternate to smoking bud to do on the irregular occasion, I am very good with self control and know I will not become addicted to substances easily if at all so I am open to all suggestions, avoiding opiates of course)",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahjznt/30mg_valium_disappointment/

21676,Stimulants,Beat that Ritalin comedown in an hour tops!!,"So... As I'm sure many of you will agree, Ritalin has a pretty nasty horrible long comedown. Some users swear by Weed, others by Benzos, etc.. I myself, am not the biggest fan of either of the 2, however I am a long term Kratom connoisseur (I take it for managing my chronic back pain, as it's waaaaay stronger than Tramadol, etc).

Long story short, I recently came off a 12 hour, 100mg Ritalin binge, starting at 9pm last night, taking my last 15mg thereof at 9am this morning. Bottom line, I'm spent and dead tired, but obviously cannot sleep..

Soon after the last Ritalin dose, I call it quits, and so the comedown sets in. The usual sweats, anxiety, depression, pumping heart and so on, when I get the idea to try and counter act the Stimulant with a sedative Red Maeng Da Kratom strain I have lying around. My thoughts here being that general calming and relaxing effects of a Red strain ""might"" just even out the dirty Ritalin shakes.

Essentially, I took a double dose (for me) of 10g Red Maeng Da roughly 25min ago, and Holy shit, IT WORKED!!! As in completely leveled out this shitty comedown to the point where I feel so incredibly relaxed and content, I'm actually enjoying this state too much and will more than likely fall asleep very soon after submitting this post. 

So there you have it, thought I'd share my small success with anyone who's having a hard time with the dirty dirty Ritalin comedown, and hope this can be of use to somebody in need. 

I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but it's definitely worth a try for those desperately in need of a quick fix. 

Feel free to ask any questions you may have or share any other solutions you may have come across that also work.

21773,Cannabis,My friend has started smoking weed at 14. Help.,"I honestly don't know where I should post this, I just need some help. Sorry mods if this isn't the type of thing that should be posted.

&amp;#x200B;

Me (male) and my friend (female - who we will call Isabella) are both teenagers. I'm pretty sheltered and haven't been near drugs before. Isabella has been the victim of gang attacks and forceful inhalation of weed. Recently she's been having a really tough time with friends and has lost quite a few due to false accusations against her.

Recently Isabella has been sneaking out of the house and going to her ""gang friend"" to get weed because of her tough friendships. This friend has participated in attacking her in the past, but she somehow still considers them a friend. She's been doing this for a little while now.

Whenever I talk to her about it, she gets furious at me for trying to understand. No matter how I phrase it, she says that she ""doesn't care"" and that she'll ""do whatever she wants"". Of course I respect her to make her own choices, and understand her point of view, however anything that I do seems to make her believe otherwise.

In general circumstances I wouldn't be posting this, as it's their own choice and they have the power to stop. My only problem is that Isabella is very easily addicted to stuff no matter the consequences, and has destroyed long-term friendships in the past because of her addicted nature. She can't look at the long-term effects of depending on weed whenever she's feeling down. If Isabella likes something, she'll do it, no matter what problems come with it.

I don't know whether I should let her do her own thing, or try and help to ensure she doesn't start depending on it at 14. What should I do? She's got mental health problems already and I don't know if I can help. I don't want to take any action until I can get some info from experienced people.

21791,Stimulants,Cramp muscles and passing out every time I stand up while high on MDMA. Why?,"
So this New year's Eve, my friends and I decided to have a sesh to celebrate, and we bought a bunch of mdma pills. 

The first one was strong (it was from another batch I was saving) but during the night I took 2 and a half more that didn't affect me as much. They felt quite mild. 

We were laying down most of the night and once in a while I needed to go to the bathroom. Around the middle of the night and feeling a medium high, I standed up and passed out. I woke up a few seconds later on the floor. It was the first time in my life that I had lost consciousness. My legs were completely tense (specially my calfs and feet) and I had to massage them to relax them. I did not feel bad, I had eaten  and it wasn't my first time taking mdma, though I suspect it was mixed with something else. 

During the rest of the night I passed out 4 times in total. They happened when I standed up. In some of them I had the cramping, in others I didn't, but the cramping happened a few times without me passing out. After sleeping 5 or 6 hours and waking up in the morning, I passed out again and felt dizzie the whole next day. 

I wasn't taking medicine appart from anti-depressants (and I had already mixed them with mdma without any problems). Nobody else had a problem with the pills appart from a friend that felt dizzie the morning after. I'm quite skinny but I had eaten well. 

Any ideas why this might have happened? Anyone with a similar experience? What should I do the next time I take mdma?

21851,Cannabis,How i use weed to drive away negative energy/spirits if anyones intrested.,"Materials needed:

Sparay bottles

Salt

Water

Cedar leaves

White sage

Frankinsense 

Myrrh

Charcoal disks( important note use the ones for 

incense or hookah)

White sand ( also important )

Incense burner 

Feather ( or not your choice)

Broom


Mortar and pestle or coffee grinder( but please use mortar and pestle)
Weed


Step 1) smoke weed. It puts me in a relaxed and positive state of mind

Step 2) grind herbs and resins ( may take a while if your using a mortar and pestil. ( we will use this mix later )

Step 3) make salt water ( i prefer sea salt) and say a blessing or prayer over it( can be simple or complicated as you want again we will be using this later) pour into spray bottle.


Step 4) open windows

Step 5) remember that broom ? Sweep the floor. I like to imagine the negative energy being swept up. 

Step 6 ) whoa we are finally at the fun/relaxing part.  Put the white sand in the incense burner ( helps even out heat ) and light the charcoal disk ( remember not the kind for cooking on the grill  don't be dumb)

Step 7) once the charcoal disk is light all the way put that powdered herb and resin mix that we made earlier on it and if you want you can say a prayer or whatever and use a feather to spread the smoke( or not its up to you).

Step 8) once the incense that we made is burned and cooled off  clean up the mess. 

Step 9) remember that salt water that we made ? Well now we are gonna use it. Spray all of the windows,doors,etc with it.

You could be really boring and copy and paste the assignment just like lots of other people (just like the system and society everyone doing what everyone else is doing no changes). Or you could brighten up the assignment with pictures and write it all yourself. Taking acid/psychedelics could be the opening to making this assignment so special and so truly unique because it is all you. You could even be in the middle, you are influenced by words of others and copy and paste a little bit but you write it in your own words. My point being: don't follow what everyone else is doing, don't go for the easy route in life, make your life more you and spice it up a bit by being fun and enjoying your life to the max.

Things were good.

If you've been lucky enough to do acid you'll likely know that food, fresh food in particular, is the shit.

I need to confess something. I am mildly lactose intolerant. Not so bad I need to avoid dairy 100% but enough I do have to watch how much I have and what type I have. But being that at this point I was tripping dicks, and this fresh cheese was the literal best thing I've ever eaten.

Cut to 20 minutes later (probably), or 20 years later (less likely, but like I said I was tripping hard and time had lost meaning). I have the strongest urge to shit. So I do. And then I shower. And repeat several times.

Somewhere between my dance with shitting and showering I waddled out to my GF and said to her that I think I have shit myself. This continues for some time, and I can distinctly remember sort of rotating between the toilet, the shower, and the living room where my GF was.

Redosed at 11:10
 180mg

This was my first experience with dxm. I have taken dph, acid, weed, coke, mdma, shrooms, and probably some other shit I'm forgetting, but I'm not a beginner in drugs is the point.
I didn't expect this kind of trip, honestly, I was expecting more a weird edm type trip with stripes and melting stuff, but it was completely different from anything I've ever encountered. 
If I'm honest 690 was too high for my first dose, and I have no idea what time but at some point I began dry heaving, and ran to the toilet to throw up. But it was an overall, good (?) Experience.

The first couple hours before I redosed I hit a couple dabs with the dex, so I just felt like crazy stoned, and was having coordination problems. My mind was going normal speed but my body was going slow motion. Very interesting. My body also felt very light and floaty. It kept getting harder and harder to walk because I was so fucked up. I remember near the end of the trip during the comedown, I ended up basically crawling upstairs  (were in the basement) to go use the restroom, and I remember looking at myself in the mirror for a second and not even being able to tell if it was me. I was just so fu ked up guys like honestly, it was crazy. 
When I started tripping, like hard, maybe an hour after I redosed, we were just listening to music, and the sound of the music was taking up the entire room, I thought it was a little loud, but I wasn't too bothered by it

Little info I forgot to give at the beginning. I'm tripping with two other people, my best friend, and a friend I hadn't seen since 2st grade. We are all sophomores in hs now. Both were on dxm and dabs as well, but not as much as me, and both had done it a lot as well

When my peripheral vision went to black, static kinda look, and all I could see was what was right in front of me, it seemed like that's all that's there. The tv, playing music, I could see the colors on the screen but couldn't make out what it actually was. I saw weird shit on the tv, and the music was really loud and nice. Things just got more intense from there.

Once I was super tired and began to nod off, was when the closed eye visuals began. This part was insane, because I had only ever gotten Closed eye visuals when I smoked on the comedown of mdma. The shit I was seeing is indescribable. A truly out of this world experience, and I don't even remember most of it. All I could hear was the music, and mumbles that were my friends voices.
I saw images of my girlfriend and realized that she is the one I want to be with forever. I saw my whole life flash before my eyes and honestly thought I was dying for half a second, but was so out of it i couldnt freak out.
 then, at the very top of the peak, I turned to my friends, so fucked up I could barely understand what I was even saying. But I told them not to talk and to just leave me alone for a while. I felt sick, but amazing, and I knew something crazy was coming. I closed my eyes. My body went completely numb, and I couldn't make out any sound coming from the real world, because at that point I didn't know what the real world was. I feel like I remember some kind of yellow press machine that was supposed to fit me in it, and I was getting in it when my friends were talking, then I told them to hush, and got in. It was all black, and everything in this world and the next was irrelevant. All I felt was euphoria for god knows how long, and I didn't even know what was going on. I fell asleep after thst, and don't remember much else. I remember my dreams weren't really normal dreams but just crazy trips similar to what I was getting before I went numb. I would wake up every once in a while, each time, less dissociated than the last time. But I woke up once shaking and I could barely see, everything looked fake in the room. The last couple times I woke up I remember seeing double vision of everything like I was drunk, or my eyes were stuck crossed, and I was so scared it was gonna be like that when I stopped tripping. When I finally woke around 9:30, I was in a good mood, not tripping anymore. I still had the headspace and the robowalk. But other than that. Good exp.

Sorry for the long read but I know some of you guys like these. I've never done ketamine, but people say you can get into the k hole at high doses of dxm as well, is that what I experienced?
Questions comments and concerns are very much welcomed. 

Thank You! (Sorry my typing is a little shitty, I'm still feeling it in my head a little bit.)

22010,Cannabis,Anyone else feels like weed is worse for cognition than alcohol?,"19M

Over the past year I have increased my weed consumption. Worry not, my current consumption isn't worthy of this subreddit. By this 'increase' I mean I went to occassionally smoking once at a party every few months, to smoking once or twice every month.

And it's like I became dumber. Seriously.

My short term memory is making me feel annoyed sometimes. Today I was driving with my mom and as I started to park my car she said, haha, don't forget to pay for the parking so you don't get a ticket. 3 seconds later, I get out of the car and don't pay for the parking. Countless more examples like suddenly I start forgetting keys in my car. Remember myself to get something the forget it seconds later. Sometimes my thought gets lost which leaves me frustrated. 

My father is very forgetfull and it's as if I am starting to impersonate him in that regard. Way too early.


I know alcohol is this sub's devil but I binge drinked way too hard in the years prior and I never realized it gave me anything negative regarding cognition.


Alcohol for me feels more 'natural' for the brain, whereas it's as if weed 'changes' my brain chemistry way too hard. Bro-terms I know, but I am just intuitively describing how I feel about these substances.


Another thing, I get blasted off weed every-fucking-time. I smoke with my mates and we should have the same tolerance. Sometimes after the 1st or 2nd joint I'm already sleeping while they go to smoke 2 more. Could it be that weed is just so much more potent for me?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aho38z/anyone_else_feels_like_weed_is_worse_for/

22065,Methamphetamine,I tried meth for the first time but I honestly don't understand what all the fuzz is about,"*TL;DR: methamphetamine is similar to other stimulants and it is possible to exercise restraint whilst using. Don't smoke or inject meth and plan your usage carefully.*

When discussing methamphetamine there always seem to be two strongly divided groups: people who hate the drug because it is addictive and damaging, and people who use it every day or weekend because it is so good.

I have some moderate experience with 'regular' amphetamine and I always believed that methamphetamine would be quite similar, but a little longer lasting with a tad stronger dose-response.

So Thursday evening I decided to give meth a try, with the proper precautions to prevent compulsive redosing, weekend long binges and to minimize toxic effects. I weighed 120 milligrams of the clear crystals, reagent test confirmed, put it aside and flushed the remainings of the bag. This 120 mg would be my maximum dose and if I would get cravings I was going to have to deal with them, because there's no additional stash.

For my first dose I weighed 30 milligrams and put it in a capsule. I think it is important to take methamphetamine orally, because it causes a less steep curve of dopamine stimulation that smoking or injecting meth causes, which is an important predictor for cravings. I also stacked up on vitamine-supplements rich in anti-oxidants and had some bottles of fruit juice at hand for keeping energy levels in check.

It took longer for the first effects to kick in than I'm used to of amphetamine. The first effects, some basic restlessness, started appearing after 30 minutes, but it took over an hour before the signature effects became noticeable.  I became a bit nauseous, but nothing too uncomfortable. The stimulation resembled that of amphetamine a lot; a relatively clean alertness and some restlessness. What I didn't see coming was the warm feeling, especially in my stomach, what you might experience from some entactogens like MDMA, 4-MMC or 6-APB.

The 30 milligrams were a nice starting dose to get an idea of the subjective effects. It lasted about 4-5 hours before the initial peak effects started to wear off a bit. But honestly the cravings weren't nearly as bad as with 4-MMC. Though  I weighed the second dose, again 30 milligrams, put it in a capsule and swallowed it. The second dose helped me through the night without the excessive sweating I sometimes experience with amphetamine.

I took the last third dose of 40 milligrams halfway through the morning, so I would get through the day and sleep at a normal time. I had some small leftovers which again I flushed because I  had enough and I like to tell myself this was just some one-time experiment. In the end I went to sleep on Friday evening around midnight.

Today, Saturday, I do have a hangover. I have less energy, concentration is impaired, I have a slight head ache and there is some feeling of stress; like I have to do something but I can't remember what. This hangover feeling is quite similar to the after-effects of amphetamine. Though I'm not having depressed or suicidal thoughts which I sometimes experience after large doses of amphetamine. All in all the hangover is manageable, considering it is caused by staying awake for 2 days in total and not eating much in the mean time.

In the end: are the subjective effects of methamphetamine worth the side-effects and the risks? I would say **definitely not**. If you really love your life and yourself you wouldn't want to feel stressed, drained and possibly depressed for several days after using, just so you can stay up a night and/or indulge in some extreme and impersonal sex parties.

This, of course, is the main pitfall of methamphetamine. The euphoria and stimulation overpower all other feelings or doubts, what makes it a good flight for insecurity or general dissatisfaction. Especially when meth is injected or smoked, the sudden and strong euphoria is quick and overwhelming, but so is the decline in effects, which causes stronger cravings. This is why you should plan your usage intensively before considering taking a dose. If you just exercise some restraint, meth is not the horribly addictive devil's product that causes your teeth to fall out and  to have gay sex parties for days on end, which it is often projected to be.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aholof/i_tried_meth_for_the_first_time_but_i_honestly/

I am a grade school male that is going through some rough shit right now. I took 5 20mg vyvanses over the past 2-3 days. I have been constantly bugging, getting lost in my thoughts, and analyzing intricate details about the peak every time it hits.
       This may sound fine and dandy, except for the whole grade school part, but every time I peak, I have a strong rush of emotions based on whatever the woes in my life are at the current moment. I have started writing these thought down and talking to close friends. They can only help to a degree, considering the worst thing any of them has done is drink a beer or smoke once with me. So when my emotions started flossing the first time I took it at home 3 hours after, it truly put me in perspective. My additive in school is not the greatest. I have all B’s in my advanced classes. But my behavior isn’t tolerable. I get sent to the office almost once a week for it. I am a very compulsive person in nature when it comes to barred activities. But I’m getting sidetracked. I was talking to my friend with really bad social anxiety about what she does to help. She was calming me down and it helps knowing that someone is here for you. But it can only help do a degree, since she’s never done any drugs besides caffeine in her life.

22110,LSD,Do you think my part werewolf mate is ready for acid?,"So a little background on why I'm asking. Me &amp; let's call him Z did some 2CB (Z's first psychedelic) with two other mates at our place a month or so. However, on the come up Z started acting a bit weird like initially taking his top off because he was really itchy. Fine, I've heard people get weird itches on 2CB, so we kind off just went along. Then on the peak things get really wonky, he keeps making abrupt noises and growls in random directions. We made sure he was okay, and the strange thing is when we asked him he answered like he was normal but would continue mid-conversations spazing out (often tilting his head and trying his best to impersonate a lion). Then as the trip ended we headed home and laughed it off. 

Fast forward to current time, and I still hang out with him loads and he seems completely normal. Yet just a few days ago we smoke some weed (albeit it was quite potent and maybe a bit too much). We're all good till it really hits and Z starts channeling his inner rabies and turns half werewolf, this is full on now and every few words is a spasmodic sound and gesture. We head to our class and on the tube I talk about it and basically tell him to chill the fuck down; if he continued others would take notice. At this point he says how he can't really control the fits but will be much better by the time we get to class. Something to point out as well is that when we were discussing bandersnatcher, when he was tweaking, he said in a super serious way how in reality life is one big game. I knew exactly what he meant and at this point I realised he's not psychotic or anything but rather coming to terms with reality. 

Now onto the acid, we agreed that we (+another close friend) would take a single 105ug of voidrealm in a months time. It will be the first time for both of them, and I want it to be a great experience. I personally think his fits are induced by being in this hyper aware state that psychedelics and weed gives you, and though they're not harming anyone it is very strange (might even trip my other mate out, but he did do the 2CB with us so knows about it). 

So this is where I want to ask you guys: 1) have you or anyone else ever had this canine-like fits &amp; do you know anything to help 2) would you recommend giving him acid. I want to make clear Z is one of the chillest and sane guys I know, and even when he trips out he's still very well grounded- just can't control his physical state. Also, I will talk to him about this more and get a better understanding of his condition.

22184,Harm Reduction + History,An Introduction to Diethyl Ether: The Antique Inhalant [LONG POST],"TL;DR at the bottom, because fuck me this is way too long.

Diethyl Ether is personally one of my favorite drugs, but on the internet I continually see a frightening amount of misinformation about the preparation and administration of this wonderful substance. Ether is not without its risks, but the shitty harm reduction info I continually see out there is certainly not making the use of this drug any safer for anyone, so today I'm going to discuss some of the ways to minimize the risks of abusing this substance as well as the history of its use. As always, don't take just my word on the subject. Do your own research elsewhere. I am capable of making mistakes just like everyone else.

Now, the next few paragraphs are a bit of history about this drug as it is quite historically significant even if it is virtually unheard of these days. Feel free to skip these bits to read up on the harm reduction later on.

Diethyl Ether was first synthesized centuries ago by the reaction of concentrated sulfuric acid (oil of vitriol) and ethanol (spirit of grain) in the presence of heat. This method was used until vapor phase reactions became the new industrial norm several centuries later.

Diethyl Ether was discovered to be analgesic on animals around 1500 A.D. but this property was not tested on humans until the 1840s when Ether began being demonstrated as an anasthetic for surgeries in common medical practice. Ether in the medical practice was eventually replaced by chloroform in this setting because chloroform, while more dangerous to patients, was also not flammable.

During the prohibition of alcohol in Europe, Ether was often made and sold as a substitute to alcohol due to the similar effects felt at lower doses. Ether was either huffed or a small drop was placed on a drink and downed (drinking is not advised, this will be discussed later on). Around this time, people started realizing just how addictive Ether was, and a condition known as ""Etheromania"" became widespread around Europe. Ether is terribly addictive, and as the addiction became more and more prevalent, institutions like the Catholic church started to weigh in, declaring Ether abuse an unabsolvable sin and refusing reconcilliation to addicts. Police began attempting to prosecute ether addicts for public intoxication but the effects of Ether wore off so quickly that by the time the police got an addict to the jailhouse the person would in most cases be stone cold sober.

As soon as alcohol prohibition was lifted, Ether abuse almost completely evaporated (pun not intended), and the drug was soon forgotten by most people, as by that time it had also passed out of use in medical settings.

Ether today is rarely abused (perhaps untrue among the people of this sub) as most people just don't know about its intoxicant properties apart from Hunter S. Thompson fans, civil war nuts, and drug nerds. In the United States, Ether is completely unscheduled and unregulated, often making up a good portion of the contents of starter fluid in stores (more on this soon).

Ether at first has effects similar to nitrous oxide yet longer lasting, but this is followed by a sort of drunken state that wears off after about 15 minutes to an hour. Higher doses can cause a ""psychedelic"" state that people say is absolutely terrifying yet addictive for whatever reason. Ether affects NMDA receptors making it a dissociative anesthetic. I do not know how best to describe this drug beyond this, only that a whipped cream can can get you to a pretty similar state but for significantly less time. Anyways, on with the harm reduction!

SKIP TO HERE IF YOU'RE SICK OF ME TALKING ABOUT HISTORY!

Anyways, there's a bit of history on this drug, now for the harm reduction stuff:

Harm Reduction Tip 1: Ether is flammable as shit, and the vapors (while fun to inhale) are also explosive in the presence of higher temperatures (flames, cigarettes, joints, stovetops, etc.). Ether vapors are heavier than air and will creep along the floor for a considerable distance (several yards/meters) until they find a source of ignition. This ignition source doesn't even need to be a fire or a spark, it can just be a hot surface. There is a reason that Ether is often about half of the makeup of starter fluid, it's really fucking flammable. Don't fuck with Ether in a place without good ventillation and keep Ether away from anything remotely hot. If something is too hot to touch, it's a risk.

HRT2: Ether, when exposed to air for long periods of time, forms explosive compounds within it called organic peroxides. Usually commercial Ether is stabilized against the formation of these chemicals but stabilizers don't last forever, so it is still not a good idea to have it stored for more than a few months. The organic peroxides formed by ether are extremely sensitive to friction and shock, so much so that taking the lid off of the Ether bottle can cause an explosion. This explosion may be small but it will light the Ether in the bottle and the person unlucky enough to open the bottle will become a human fireball. Old Ether is one of the leading causes of fires and explosions in professional laboratories and meth labs alike. Once you crack open a bottle of Ether, either binge it away over a few weeks or make sure you break it out for a group of people who can finish it. Long term storage for this stuff is a big no.

HRT3: Ether has a very low boiling point, below the internal temperature of your body actually. Drinking this stuff causes it to boil in your stomach and become a gas, and that can lead to a ruptured stomach in extreme cases. Also the vapor tastes shit enough so why fuck with it in even more concentrated form?

HRT4: PUTTING STARTER FLUID ON WATER DOESN'T GET RID OF ANY FUCKING HEPTANE FOR FUCKS SAKE EVERY FUCKING TIME I FUCKING SEE SOME RETARDED MOTHERFUCKER SPOUTING THIS STUPID FUCKING SHIT I GET REALLY FUCKING MAD! Heptane does NOT dissolve in water. Ether dissolves WAY BETTER in heptane than Ether dissolves in water. If one were to add starter fluid to a mixture of Ether and water, ALL of the Ether would be sucked up by the heptane in the starter fluid! Simple. Goddamn. Chemistry. Google exists, or did the neurotoxicity of the heptane you stupid fucks were huffing make you all too retarded to use a keyboard? Fuck whoever started spreading this shit it's downright dangerous. Starter fluid Ether CANNOT be made safe unless one has training in chemistry and has the equipment necessary to fractionate out the Ether. Usually those people have access to pure Ether though. Buy your Ether pure online. Yes it's more expensive, but it's not neurotoxic like fucking starter fluid... /rant

HRT5: Sit against a wall and hold the Ether rag up to your face while huffing, that way if you pass out you'll drop the rag. If you pass out with a rag over your face you are in danger of suffocation and overdose. While Ether has a pretty high therapeutic index, that doesn't mean you can't die. Youll pass out long before you reach dangerous levels of Ether in your system but you're only safe if you're no longer breathing Ether.

HRT6: This one isn't so much harm reduction as it is a heads up. Ether gets into every part of you and it fucking smells. You'll be exuding an odor of Ether for several days after you decide to huff this stuff, though the first 24 hours are when the smell is most detectable.

HRT7: Ether is HIGHLY addictive! Some people say it's more addictive than cocaine, though I have not yet tried cocaine so I cannot personally vouch for this. Earlier in the history portion that everyone likely skipped I mentioned a condition called ""Etheromania"" and this is the name for dependency on Ether. This drug is so addictive that the addiction to it has it's own name, if that means anything. Dependency thankfully only causes a craving for more Ether so no nasty physical withdrawals but addiction is addiction and fucking with Ether always carries that risk. Know yourself and be careful, people have been known to start huffing starter fluid for their fix, and while Ether alone probably won't cause nasty physical side effects, heptane sure as hell will.

Anyways thanks to all of you who made it this far, I just wanted to inform people about one of the lesser known legal highs out there, and also because I get irrationally angry when I hear about the water extraction tek. Total bullshit that is...anyways, stay safe all, respect Ether for the drug it is and don't fuck with starter fluid!

TL;DR:

Some history blah blah blah...

HRT1: Ether is flammable.

HRT2: Ether goes bad by forming explosive shit in it due to contact with air.

HRT3: Don't drink Ether, you could rupture your stomach.

HRT4: The starter fluid/water extraction tek is total bullshit. Don't fuck with starter fluid unless you have chemistry knowledge/equipment or are a whore for brain damage.

HRT5: Sit against a wall or a tree and make sure you huff from the rag such that if you pass out it will fall away from your face.

HRT6: Ether fucking stinks and stays on you for a long fucking time.

HRT7: Ether is fucking addictive as shit. Know yourself and how you react to these sorts of things.

Don't fuck with starter fluid.",51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahpl3j/an_introduction_to_diethyl_ether_the_antique/
22191,Psychedelics,First time taking acid.,"Formatted on mobile.
 The first time i took acid, I was on the run from a juvenile placement when I was 16 and I couldn't find a ride out of the city, so I started chilling with the homeless people.
 I had some of the best moments of my life during this time, but the one that sticks out the most was the acid, it was around 7 or 8 i remember that because the bars were open. We ended up sharing a bottle of captain Morgan and smoked a sploof between three of us and, then we took the tabs. They have me half of one because it was my first time, and about 10 minutes go by and we see some of are friends smoking some weed and we smoked with them for a while, and then it started to kick in, we were at that point running through a park, and the guy who we called pirate was with us, started doing some kind of diving roll thing, and that's when our friend we called hippie started freaking out, thinking pirate was the leader of some kind of cult, and controlled the whole town.
  Around this point I started laughing at every little thing and was tripping hard. We decided to get some food so we walked down the street to Jimmy John's and I started to see longitude and latitude lines forming on the ground, and suddenly I knew exactly where we were, where we where headed, and where I wanted to go. I started going into some philosophical conversation with myself.
   A little bit later the thought of pirate in a cult came back around, and every person I passed on the street, was doing some ahoy matey, thing one guy even started talking about captain hook and jumped up and clicked his ankles together, so I just ran, and ran, until i felt safe. I remembered we had another bottle of liquor in my bag and me being high asf out of my mind I gave it to another homeless dude who wasn't having a good night. And to my surprise two days later he saved up enough money and bought me lunch.

22217,I :love: Drugs,Beyoncé saved me from a bad trip,"So back in 2016 I did a lot of LSD, me and my friend used to trip every single weekend and sometimes in other days too. We used to take it, smoke some weed, and either watch movies, listen to music or play xbox. 

Ok so in one of these sessions, I took more than my usual dose (I used to only take 1 hit usually, but my friend talked me into taking two) and yeah some of you might say that ain’t shit but I’m a very anxious person and I know my limits ok? So anyways, after like one hour I was freaking the fuck out because I couldn’t stop thinking on how my (then) heavy drug use made me fail college, and I was all like “wtf am I going to do wtf” and I was in like a loop thinking “I’m a junkie&gt;I failed college&gt;I failed at life&gt;I’m a junkie&gt;I failed college&gt;I failed at life” and repeat you know?. I was in this state for a good 40 minutes, and my anxiety kept increasing. I remember I was so uncomfortable that even the colors of everything around me seemed like darker, like if someone applied a filter to my vision idk.

My friend was playing music from his phone, and his music is usually like indie and shit (st Vincent, Grimes, Bjork...) but then the universe decided to throw me a bone and Beyoncé’s *Schoolin Life* started to play. I immediately recognized her voice but I never heard that song before so I asked my friend to keep it playing. The song basically says “chill, live your life, whatever” but not from like a hedonistic perspective, but from an optimistic one. Damn, I felt as if she was talking to me, personally. The colors started to feel normal again, the awful anxiety faded away and it sounds very stupid but at the time it felt mind-blowing, like “everything is going to be OK because Beyoncé said that” and if you’re as gay as I am you know what I’m saying. I wasn’t even a fan of hers before but daaaaaamn, she unknowingly calmed me the fuck down and I will always appreciate her for it. It’s not even a quiet song, it’s a big, 80s vibe song with synths and choruses and shit but damn it worked so good. That great feeling stayed with me for days after taking the acid and every time I listen to this song I remember that night and can’t help but smile a little. Oh and BTW, my life did get better (I still do drugs, just not as intensely as before, and everything sort of worked out and I’m in a pretty good place right now).

Last night, about 15 of my friends and I went to a music festival to see diplo (EDM music). I have done molly twice before but I had never rolled, or gotten high off of it. 

My friends and I picked up lots of molly and popped 3 caps each when we got inside (I wanted to be sure I would roll). It didn’t hit for about 45 minutes to an hour. I was beginning to get skeptical when I looked to my left and saw my friends face light up. 

My friends eyes were huge and he had this incredible smile, he grabbed me by the shoulders and screamed “I’m rolling son I’m fucking rolling”!!!!

Seconds later my world blew up. The lights from the stage twisted and brightened. The crowd around me seemed to move in freeze frame, and warmth shot up through me like morphine.

As I reached peak, about two hours after taking the molly, Diplo came on stage. At this point my body was overwhelmed with the most intense pleasurable feeling I consider possible. I was basically riding full orgasm throughout my entire body and it had been going on for over 30 minutes.

I felt one with the crowd, I couldn’t tell you how many girls I kissed but it had to have been over 15. Each time my lips touched another persons sparks exploded behind my eyes in the truest sense of euphoria I have ever felt. 

The night continued on, much like a the project x party edit. I felt more connected and alive then I even knew was possible... the best way to describe it was your child like imagination and wonder fully restored, mixed with love, euphoria and a continuous, intense orgasm AND head rush, for hours non stop.

It was so beautiful I almost wanted to cry. I was lifted by some of my friends and since we were toward the front of the stage, I was able to look back and see nearly 100,000 people behind me. I felt connected to each and every one of them, as if they were all cheering me on, and knew all my flaws and secrets yet still loved me for who I am.

When I woke up this morning, my body tinged and my mind felt free. I have so much more love for the world, and for each and every living being. 

This experience truly changed my view of the world, and opened my eyes to another, more beautiful side of life. One in which souls are allowed outside their cage, and fear is not a thing. 

For anybody considering the use of this drug, I highly recommend it. However do not take it lightly, please stay hydrated as you will sweat. Make sure you’re with people whom you love and trust, and don’t do too much. 

Let me know if anybody else has had an experience similar to mine! I would love to hear :)

22416,I :love: Drugs,Adenosine Trip Report,"Adenosine, a component of Adenosine triphosphate, or atp which is how our cells respirating turn glucose into fuel (atp) accumulates throughout the day in the brain and causes fatigue. High doses can cause hallucinations though, so One could theoritically trip on adenosine after 48+ hours of buildup. Now you might think that stimulants would get you there easily but as far as I can see, there's no way to catalyze the adenosine buildup in the brain, and stims only work to ward fatigue by slowing adenosine production, but you still need energy so the body turns to reserves. So my recommendation if you want to try, and what I did is to get your body into ketosis, take no other drugs period, especially not stimulants, not even caffeine, and fight sleep. I made it to 50 hours. around 40 hours my body load changed and I felt light. My skin became exponentially more sensitive and sounds had a lot more depth. Not music, but all sound. I went through all of kanye wests discography and about half of lil waynes. Check out his song ""dr carter"" from tha carter iii by the way, lil wayne really is a poet, and the real deal, I use to think he was pop culture crap lie most of it, but he really has a mystique. Kanye however on examination is much worse than I thought lyrically. He is a spectacular producer, maybe the best, just a very average lyricist and boring thinker.

as far as harm reduction goes, you want to try to finally sleep at the same time you normally would when you finally succumb and in multiples of 90 minutes if you use an alarm clock, although its best to recover on a rest day naturally, and if done properly you might not feel any sleep debt at all. It's best to pay all your sleep debt as well, I think, before attempting adenosine. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a serious substance, and not one I've ever even heard of anyone using, should be fine as long as you eat and drink steadily thoughout the entire duration.

22460,Psychedelics,NEVER take lsd if you are taking perscribed lithium,"I will put a tl;dr at the bottom if you don’t feel like reading.

Also yes the LSD was tested it wasn’t Nbome. It doesn’t have to be Nbome to nearly kill you if you are on Lithium.

So I was the trip sitter in this situation. I’ve tripped and trip sat many times so I was up for it. Didn’t really expect much to happen except for a good time watching my 5 friends trip dick on 2 tabs. Boy was I wrong. I ended up saving a life and witnessing some of the most fuck shit I’ve seen so far in my life. 

The trip started off very good. Everyone was laughing, talking, and just enjoying the experience. I felt at ease. It was going to be a piece of cake trip sitting this night. 

I put on some trippy videos for everyone and everything was going great. Until my friend, “Kate”, started having a slightly bad trip. Her and her boyfriend got in a fight earlier that day and she got stuck in a thought loop that she needed to call him. We all discouraged her many times and tried to help her out but we eventually gave up. 

She would come back and leave the room to call him at least 5 times until she was finally satisfied. Then out of nowhere she had a seizure lasting about 1-2 minutes. Everyone else was kind of freaking out but I managed to calm them down. Once she came back I asked her if she knew what just happened but she had no idea.

She was fine for about a half an hour after that until she eventually became unable to speak. She would cycle in and out of consciousness while her whole body was constantly twitching. We would yell her name and she would open her eyes and form an oddly creepy smile. 

I checked her heart rate and it was clocked at 145 bpm. This was enough to have me make the decision to take her to the hospital. 

“Kate we are going to take you to the hospital do you understand?”

Still no response. Another friend and I helped her up. She seemed to cooperate. She was able to walk as long as we were holding her and directing her. I helped her put on some slip on boots. She knew how to put on the first one as I put her foot in it. I assumed she could get on the second one but she just picked it up, put it on her hand and stared in confusion. This is what made me worry if she was ever going to come back. If I was ever going to see the real her again. 

I had 2 (tripping) friends come with me. We escorted her to my car, got her seatbelt on and drove to the hospital. It was a struggle to get her to step out of the car. We parked on the wrong side of the hospital so we had to walk to the other side about 100 meters away. 

As we got to the side of the building, she stopped and stood. She looked like she didn’t want to be there. Her face showed a combination of anger and fear. Her arms jutted out rapidly, she choked trying to breathe and collapsed on to the ground. It looked like she had just died. She wasn’t moving until after about 10 seconds when she started violently thrashing on the ground, stuggling to breathe. 

I called 911 immediately and described our location. The violent thrashing didn’t stop. The ambulance pulled up and I flagged it to where she was. The paramedics stepped out of the ambulance and asked me some questions. 

I told them everything. When she had her first seizure, what drugs she took, and how she was completely unresponsive for the hours prior. 

A fire truck showed up to help carry her into the ambulance. It was very hard for them to pick her up. She was thrashing even harder than before while screaming almost demonic sounding screams. 

“It’s okay Kate, we’re going to help you” 

They were frightened by how she was so resistant towards them. They then told us we could leave so we did. 

On the drive back we all talked about how worried we were about her. I assumed that she would be fine the next day and not remember a single thing. 

And I was correct. We visited her the next day in the hospital. She was on an Ativan drip and explained how sorry she was that she put us through this. Also how she remember almost nothing from the night. We told her we were just so relieved that she was okay and she didn’t need to be sorry. The doctor told us that she had serotonin syndrome and that she could have died if we didn’t take her to the hospital. 

Her parents were not mad at all about what happened. They just thanked us for taking care of her and making the right decision. 

Moral of the story, don’t take LSD and lithium together or any other harmful combinations. Always do your research before taking ANY substance. I emailed the psychonaut wiki team about this and they have recently added lithium as an interaction for LSD and other psychs. 

tl;dr: my friend took LSD while on prescription lithium, had multiple seizures, got serotonin syndrome and almost died",1754,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahrrp4/never_take_lsd_if_you_are_taking_perscribed/

It seems that every time I smoke and I'm not actively listening to music or watching TV, I start physically hearing clear voices, like people talking to me and responding to what I think and say and they do NOT stop talking when I tell them to shut up. I also notice that the paranoia is bad because if I look into a dark room I'll see faces and shadowy people appear and sometimes just stare at me and move about. It's basically like the normal pareidolia and what not but x100. The voices consist of a woman with a soft voice in her 20's, my own voice, and another woman who is slightly older, but sometimes I'll hear new ones. The shadowy figures and faces are usually monstrous and a bit demonic and when I'm high I usually think they are watching me, but last night I felt safe because I think that I thought my window screen was some sort of magical barrier. Not the stupidest thing I've thought stoned out of my mind like that.


I guess my question would be, is this normal? Will it go away with time? How long will it take before I can actually get ""high"" and happy like other people who smoke?

22834,I :love: Drugs,MDMA Dosing Question for my Girlfriend?,"Hey everyone,  


I hope its cool if I ask you all a question real quick..  


  
So my girlfriend and I have been in a pretty nasty argument/fight the past couple of days, and finally today we made up..   


She is moving away to be closer to her work, and its only like an hour north of where I live currently its been causing her to stress quite a bit and she's afraid that I am never going to want to see her and that its never going to work.. I honestly dont think its that drastic considering I have property in the city I rent out and am up there quite a bit already, and so I think it will be just fine.  


Anyways, I think she feels guilty about the move, and so thats why tonight when she agreed and offered to do molly with me I couldn't be more ecstatic!  She has never really done any drugs, maybe experimented with coke and smoked weed a handful of times, but yeah when it comes to drugs shes a complete newbie.  

&amp;#x200B;

I on the other hand would have an easier time naming you the drugs I have not tried, rather than the drugs I have tried.  So I am comfortable and pretty well experienced with the drug, and have no fear or expect any complications when it comes to dosing size for myself.  Her on the other hand, I am a bit worried..  


I know this has never really happened to me with molly and the molly I have right now is extremely clean and good, but I know with ecstacy tablets, I have from time to time gotten that overwhelming feeling, the one where you start to get really nervous and your anxiety starts to build..    


The one where you suddenly start to look around and wonder how everyone else is functioning right now when you feel the way that you do and you just dont know whats going to happen or if you going to live haha.. Maybe thats just me or maybe its just a bunch of piperazine and shitty tablets that I tried... But whatever the case I just want to make sure that she doesn't get overwhelmed and was curious to see what you all think would be appropriate dosing size for her to try out for the first time?  


She is probably  
Height 5'4"" - 5'5""    
Weight 115-120lbs  


Maybe?    


Anyway, we had planned on maybe going out to grab a bite to eat and having a drink or two at dinner and then coming back and dosing and hanging out in the bed all night fooling around : ) or who knows maybe we will end up doing something else crazy, but I dont know the original plan was to stay in and enjoy each others company while on it and mess around, especially since it is her first time and I know she is rather nervous.  


Im not scared and I think she will love it and so I am stoked for the night to happen already lol  


So please let me know your thoughts and any information you all might have as far as dosing guide for Molly

22861,Cannabis,Weed is physically addictive,"So just last week there was a post about hiw weed is addictive and that a lot of pot smokers have a pretty unhealthy ""smoke weed everyday"" atttitude towarda it, and lately there have been a lot of posts on this forum about people strugglong to take a tolerance break. All of these posts though always want to specify that it is psychologically addictkve not physically addictive. 

Well im here to tell all of you that it is absolutely 100% physically addictive and anybody who says it isnt doesnt have any idea what they are talking about.

I have been physically and psychologically addicted to crack cocaine, IV heroin, and weed. Specifically dabs and hash. I smoked weed for a year straight all day everyday from the moment i woke up until i went to sleep. I would smoke a gram a day bare minimum. Usually on an average day i could smoke 3-5 grams. On a good day if i was making money i could smoke 10+ grams. I could face 10 blunts by myself. After a year of this with no break my tolerance was so fucked up i switched to dabs and withkn a few months i was smoking 1-2 grams of dabs a day. Then slowly but surely over the coutse of about 2-3 months weed started feeling very different. It didnt feel the same it made me very paranlid and depressed and anxious. Until onr day i had a full on panic attack. It felt lime a heart attack i thought i was dying. I started freakkng ojt and had my GF take me to the hospital and they explakned i was just havkng a panic attack. I insisted i was having a stroke or a heart attack, but after a few monutes of bejng in the ER and being surrounded by doctors i calmed down because i knew i would be ok since i was there and rhen i started to feel normal again. The attack lasted a solid 25 minutes and it scared me to death. I started having panic attacks like this every single day sometimes multiple times a day. Then i quit smoking weed because i thought it was causing them. The panic attacks went away but i went through 2 weeks of withdrawl. Nightmares no appetite, aches and pains all over my body, no energy, depression. I felt awful the whole time. It took me about a full month to reocver back to my old self. 

Take this from somebody who has been addicted to freebase and heroin also. The physical addiction from weed is not as serious as hard drugs but it is very serious. It exists. Im really tired of seeing people on this forum acting like weed is not addictive and its ok to blaze 24/7. I havent smoked weed in 4 months and dont ever want to again. Weed used to be my favorite drug and i smoked so fucking much of it that i cant enjoy it anymore i hate it now its makes me sad and paranoid and have panic attacks. If for no other reason than dont overdo it with weed and esprcially dabs because it could ruin your brain chemistry to the point where you can no longer enjoy it at all.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahu6sn/weed_is_physically_addictive/

I know this is something I should be acting my psychiatrist directly, but I currently have no phone service or method of contacting him until my next appointment, which is almost a week away and I'm seriously worried about this right now.

I have very severe panic disorder with extremely frequent panic attacks, starting about a month and a half ago or so. They ended up ruining my life enough to make me suicidal and land me in an inpatient hospital on two occasions. In total, I was in there for a little over two weeks.

During that time, they had me on Ativan (1mg if I remember correctly) as needed. Over the course of my stays, I took an average of one a day, give or take. They sent me home with a supply of 10 pills and I continued to use them at roughly the same rate until I ran out.

After the second discharge, however, my psychiatrist switched me to 1mg Xanax and told me to take it three times a day PLUS one as needed (!!). I instead have been taking them only as needed, which so far has been two on my first day back and two today. I'm just now learning about how serious and potentially deadly Xanax/benzo withdrawals are and am becoming extremely worried. Have I been on Ativan long enough to develop an addiction? How long can I continue taking the Xanax at this rate before I risk addiction and serious withdrawals (seizures, more panic attacks, etc).? Do I have to take them at certain times to avoid withdrawals now or can I continue only as needed?

I'm extremely conflicted because my life has been a waking nightmare since the panic attacks started and the Xanax works beautifully in stopping them, but I'm terrified of becoming addicted and potentially having a seizure from withdrawals.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr severe panic disorder, constant panic attacks, spent about 2 weeks in inpatient care where I took Ativan roughly once a day give or take, doc changed prescription to 1mg xanax three times a day, been taking only as needed instead. Do I have to worry about Ativan withdrawals from taking them for that long? How long before I get physically addicted to the Xanax and have to worry about serious withdrawals? Am I fucked?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahv6e7/questions_about_therapeutic_ativanxanax_use_am_i/
23045,Lisdexamphetamine,Vyvanse + 5 HTP Experience,"I'm not sure if I figured out my problem's solution.

Issue: ADHD-PI given Vyvanse. Worked for 1 hour or 2, then cognitive shutdown, tired. Little scary to have a completely empty head- thinking was hard. Short term memory was worse and I couldn't even follow as well as I could unmedicated. I learnt that after Vyvanse wore-off, I felt much better and if I re-dosed or used IR Adderall- it worked as intended.

Read that this shutdown was due to dopamine-serotonin imbalance causing panic attack like shutdown. Took 5HTP because Psych dint want to give me an SSRI. Looks like it's working- but its only been one day and I don't want to get excited because life experiences have been crappy. *Dosing Advice for 5-HTP*, similar experiences, thoughts, ideas welcome.

**TL;DR: Stimulants put me to sleep. Using 5-HTP seemingly corrected serotonin imbalance &amp; make them work. Dosing advise for 5 HTP, thoughts?**

23068,yourtexthere,Help me understand whether she is on drugs?,"Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask, I thought you guys might be able to help me.

My sister struggles with mental health and alcohol abuse, but I wonder if she is also using drugs to self medicate? Want to know so I can better help her, any thoughts appreciated. 

She has been up for two nights in a row with it any sleep, which i thought was uncommon with only alcohol. 

She often have a white thing in her mouth, not sure if it’s her saliva or something she eats or what. 

She falls over a lot, is very clumsy, completely stops detecting social cues. She seems relaxed, not the usual anxious and paranoid behavior she has when she has had a few drinks, which is also making me think she is using something else. 

The main reason I think it’s not alcohol is that she doesn’t fall asleep or vomit. Her eyes goes beady and shiny. 

Anything I can look for to figure out more?

23129,Cannabis,Question about Shipping Weed to a state with Legal Recreational Marijuana.,"So I’ve been doing a lot of searching and really don’t know how to word this question but I’m gonna try and see if anyone here knows an answer. 

So I live in a state that has recently decriminalized recreational marijuana. Recreational dispensaries will be opening up here in a couple of years. We already have plenty of medical dispensaries, but recently ALL 70 dispensaries in my area were shut down due to bullshit government regulations. 

I am very sick and need my medicine to be able to function properly in day to day life. I have no hookups in this new city and don’t have any options of legally obtaining some weed now that the government fucked us all hard. 

Now I am expereinced with computers and am well and able to get weed from the onion fields. I have ordered a few things in the past with no issues. I haven’t ordered in months because I’m a little paranoid about LE. But mainly I just want to know the legality of this.

So let’s say I do order some wax or bud and my state is legal, would there be any repercussions if LE somehow discovered the contents of the mail? If anyone has any answers I would greatly appreciate it. I only have enough medication to get me through the week, and after that I’m screwed. 

Sorry if this question has been asked. Any response is appreciated. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahvnbw/question_about_shipping_weed_to_a_state_with/
23155,I :love: Drugs,Why i love Lyrica(Pregabalin),"Hi guys and girls,
I just want to share with you why i think Pregabalin is the drug of the future and i really wonder why it isn't so popular in the western drug scene. 
So first of all, i am volunteering in Israel for 7 months and i found a dealer here who gives me a full pack of 150mg Lyrica for about 10€. 
And the working times i have here are really shitty, i have to work every day from 7:00-8:30 and then again at 14:30-20:00. 
So if i want to take a stimulant in the working week, it is really hard to take it without being high when i work or having a bad comedown while i work. But Lyrica is the wonderdrug for ending a stimulant high, i just snort a 150mg capsule and in 5 minutes i'm completely sober. And also the high of just lyrica is really nice, and it even has the effect to boost opioids, so if i have a 10mg oxycontin left, from which i wouldn't feel really much, i just take 150 or 300mg lyrica and the 10mg and i'm really high.
By the way does anybody know how high the risk for addiction is and if it has a physical addiction potential, because it does in a way affect the GABA receptors and GABAerg drugs normally have a physical addiction potential. 
Just wanted to share this, thank you for reading and have a nice day.

23181,Antidepressants,About SSRIs for anxiety (my case),"I've been taking SSRIs for a long time. Took Citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine and I'm taking sertraline by now. Before change the antidepressant the doctor made me took them for the time of six months, okay so. The thing is, THEY NEVER WORKED IN ANYWAY TO HELP ME ON MY ANXIETY'S. I also have depression and in this the medicines helped a lot, so it wasn't really useless, but man anxiety is really painful. I got diagnosis for general anxiety disorder, social anxiety and when it comes to a anxiety crisis I actually reached to points in that I started hitting my head in the wall. Why would I do this? I HAVE NO IDEA.
I think I'm more calm now so I'll continue.
At the start of the treatment I was also prescribed clonazepam. I started taking it at the morning, slowly increasing the dose, 3mg was the dose I reported the doctor that was doing cool (gold times). So I moved and my new doctor thought I was in benzo  dependence (2 months and half of use), he didn't get me more clonazepam prescriptions, but got me cloxazolam 1mg. I took 1 in the morning, for a month, he didn't get more, it was ""dangerous"".

 Thats it, I'll die from this shit when unconsciously jump in front of a car or some shit just because I got embarrassed or whatever. Maybe I'm just overreacting as I always do.

Another negative point of all of this, I got on search of drugs as exit to my stress, anxiety and depressed and suicidal thoughts. Not bad at all, knowledge is always good and I think responsible use of drugs can lead to good moments. But I just keep thinking in how many people had/have their lives ruined by drugs, and how easy is to get in this way.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahvvus/about_ssris_for_anxiety_my_case/
23189,Psychedelics,Psilocybin mushrooms and nature - a beautiful trip #report,"So this trip report comes from a trip I had with a couple close friends around august last year. We just had a conversation remembering those moments and I thought it would be neat to share it with you guys.

So straight to it: one of my friends has a house in the country side of this already stranded-away town, and it is very close to a pretty neat virgin (except for occasional camping sites and psychonauts) forest, he's been telling us about it for quite a while so we decided to finally pay a visit and go shroom hunting to get ourselves some yummi magic mushroom.

We got there around 10 am and I'm gonna be quick with this part: we settled the camping site, drank a couple of beers and went around looking for some shrooms, the plan was to get at least 2 - 3 grams each, but to be honest we didn't have a scale so we just followed our ""instincts"".

Around 1 pm we were back at the rustic camping site we'd built and decided to have a light snack before the trip. We also drank one or maybe two beers, around half and hour later we decided to eat a decent amount of shrooms and hoped for the best, we put on some chill music and decided to smoke a blunt (divided in between 4 people so it wasn't that much).

Just to be clear, one of my friends took maybe half the shrooms the rest did in order to tripsit us.

Around an hour or maybe hour and a half later we started to feel the effect of the shrooms, I got the classical head space and the funny and weird thoughts that came along with a profound sensarion of bliss and happiness. This is when we decided to go for a walk, so we headed to this place nearby where you can swim at this small river (it's rather shallow so no risk of drowning) and we jumped right into the water, this is where things began to get trippy but in an amazing way.

I remember feeling just so happy and in ""the right place"" I was so at bliss and having so much fun, I began to see patterns forming on top of the water and how the small waves we were making kinda ""talked to me"" as if I could  see or rather ""feel"" meaning in them.

At some point the water began to look just like glass but really really bright, and it actually made me feel weird because I was sure I wasn't going to be able to move on this new ""solid crystal water"" but as I moved the crystals seemed to break and form sharp waves instead of regular ones full of colours and I just got lost into it for what it felt like ages. At some point I realized one of my friends put some music on a speaker and it just made everythin better.

After a little while, and to I think was about the peak I was feeling too overwhelmed by water (even tho it was just to my knees at this point) and also I think the music kinda gave me a funny vibe so i decided to get out of the water and just sit by a tree to take some sun light. My friends quickly followed me and at this point I remember I started to think of them as my ""pack"" and that we were just a bunch of very smart animals hangin up together (and ofc we were) but this thought made me laugh and happy and I kept thinking about it for a while.

The shrooms made me feel lazy at this point, very lazy and it was probably just around 4 pm (3 hours since we ate them) and I for some reason felt it going down already so I decided to smoke a joint, but none of my friends wanted so I head back to the camping site (not far away) and I felt like it took me years to roll a thin one and I smoked it on my way back.

Just as I hoped it sent me back up a bit, but I was getting amazing visuals walking back... the trees, all the leaves and the colours and the sun light passing through it all was just astonishing and so beautiful I think it was one of my happiest trips ever. Thats why I do recommend that once you are comfortable with a substance like lsd or psilocybin it is worth it to go out and try in nature... provided you have a nice and safe place with friends of course.

We spent the rest of the evening chilling by the trees, talking about life and our feelings and how beautiful nature is. We ended up smoking just a bit more but right at the end of the trip, we went back at the camping site and lightd some fire as it was begining to get dark and a bit cold.

This story has a second part in which we took a lil more shrooms, weed and smoked an special salvia blunts I make... which made the night shamanic and very interesting, but that is a story for another time, right now I just wanted to share with you the beauty of this trip in the nature.

Peace, hope you enjoy the reading.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahvxs7/psilocybin_mushrooms_and_nature_a_beautiful_trip/

23216,Cocaine,Is it possible to get high off second hand crack fumes?

23220,Long Post,Report Of A Very Bad Trip: 200ug LSD + two 75mg~ lines of Ketamine.,"**TL;DR: Ego-death is the single most terrifying experience possible.**

Dropped the 200ug tab on Friday night around 9:30pm and waited for the come-up by painting my nails blue. I was around my friend’s house with three of my closest friends and one of them dropped his last two 200ug tabs, the other two were on other drugs.

Whilst I was coming up, I was having a brilliant trip. I had the giggles and was laughing at the most ridiculous stuff, like an image I found of a house with legs smoking a pipe. I was in such an amazing headspace and honestly it was the best I’d ever felt on LSD before – I had dropped a tab on the Monday night prior to this Friday so I was expecting tolerance to come into play and I thought I wouldn’t trip nearly as intensely as I did then, so I decided to partake in the smoking of a spliff that was being passed around and had no qualms about accepting bongs, to bring the trip up to a standard level.

We were planning on spending that night on ketamine only, but couldn’t get a hold of the dealer so we decided to just drop tabs instead. Eventually the ketamine dealer pulled through anyway and I decided to get myself a bag like I was originally planning to – this was my ultimate downfall as I was in a brilliant place in the trip before I started sniffing lines of ketamine. The other two people who had ket only had one little bump each before they passed me the mirror, but I’m impatient and a big fan of ketamine so I started racking up lines of ketamine that would fuck me up quickly.

I didn’t feel anything from the ketamine for a good ten minutes, but my trip started to get more and more intense as my stoned-ness set in, and I thought I could handle this easily. Eventually however, I started to dissociate from my body without even noticing the effects of the ketamine taking place, maybe because I was so lost in the body-load the acid had given me.

What really started to go wrong was I started to thought-loop pretty hard, and my thought process involved repeatedly convincing myself I didn’t exist in my own head, over and over and over again. I could bring myself back into reality and try and anchor myself in but this would only last a couple of minutes at best before I got distracted by something and the thought process of convincing myself I didn’t exist happened again, and again, and again quicker and quicker until it really started to freak me out.

By the time I started to freak out, I was nearly crying. I’d mentioned this to my friends and I remember saying things like “I keep tripping myself out man, I don’t like this trip anymore” I had to repeatedly ask everyone “Am I real?” and “What the fuck is happening to me?” with increasing desperation, I had to know they were sure that I, they and this reality were actually real and they were doing their absolute hardest to convince me so, but it was for nought. I was trying as hard as I could to anchor myself into reality which I believe is what actually fucked me up in the long run.

I kept getting more and more scared and freaked out, until suddenly, without me even knowing about it until after it had happened, I felt my everything implode violently. And when I say everything, I mean my body, my consciousness, reality itself and the entire universe all squeezed down into the tiniest little mote of space and actually imploded violently. According to my friends, I yeeted myself across the living room with my arms and legs flailing violently while screaming louder than they’d ever heard a human scream.

It felt like my body got ripped inside out like I’d been left in the vacuum of outer space. This happened more than one time, where I’d feel my body implode in on itself. There were times where I thought there were 2 separate realities and I was living in both. There was a time where I thought I was one of the split personalities inside my friend’s head. There was a point where I convinced myself I had gone actually completely blind. There was a bunch of other really bad shit happening to me but I can’t/don’t want to remember everything that was going on – all I know is that I was scared.

I have never felt true terror like I felt. I have never experienced anything quite as terrifying as I felt. I have never screamed like that, and I screamed as loudly as my body would let me, multiple times, against my own will.

I had managed to completely dissociate out of my body, whilst repeatedly convincing myself out of reality. After a certain amount of time doing this, I had actually convinced myself that I did not exist. It felt like being in the void of reality. The absence of consciousness. The pure dark nothingness. I saw everything and I saw absolutely nothing. I had absolutely no idea what was actually going on and honestly I don’t remember the experience perfectly. I really don’t want to think about it more than I have to however I’m writing this down in as much detail as I can process so that I have something to come back to if ever I want to reflect on the experience.

I don’t know how I felt when I was in that void of reality, when I didn’t exist, other than terror. 

If I had to describe it, I would choose three words: 
“infinite screaming insanity.”

Imagine infinitely battling with the idea that you exist only to then lose to indescribable agony and the most unimaginable terror.

Once my peak had finished, I kind of ‘woke up’ back into my body. I existed again. I was shocked and it took all the effort I could muster to not scream, but I was glad to be alive. I was breathing hard. I had felt an infinite amount of realities and my own existence literally implode. After I’d calmed down a bit and my friends had explained to me what was going on, I felt okay. I could still feel my body wanting to implode in on itself but I could keep it under control. I finally felt anchored into a reality, but only just. 

While coming down from the acid, because I knew I wasn’t going to be able to sleep, I watched a couple of Studio Ghibli movies to take my mind away from what had just happened, however it was ultimately futile as random flashbacks from throughout the night kept popping into my head – the terror I felt, the way my body had felt like it had been violently ripped inside out. Not even Ponyo’s beauty could distract me. My friend drove me home, I ate pie, drank tea and watched more Studio Ghibli movies to sleep. I was actually scared of being unconscious for a good while because I wanted to be conscious and awake and thinking. The famous phrase “I think, therefore I am” by Descartes began to make a great deal of sense to me.

For the entire day after, I had really weird visual snow and it looked like I was watching a movie through my own eyes, but as of typing this up two days after the event, my vision has thankfully gone back to normal.

The only things I’m going to be able to take away from this experience are:
I suddenly want to stay grounded into reality as much as possible, instead of being desperate to escape it. And, don’t fuck with acid. I won’t be partaking in psychedelics for a long while, and if I do ever decide to get back into it, I’m definitely only going to be dosing very lowly, at the 50ug end.

After this trip, I feel deeply psychologically wounded, I have the looming fear that one day in the future when I’ve completely forgotten about the experience, I’m going to have a PTSD level flashback where I feel that true primal terror once again and my body gets ripped inside out as my reality implodes. I can feel it coming and I’m not looking forward to it. I’ve been left with the horrifying knowledge that my sense of reality can just be completely detached from my consciousness at any given time, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I don't even want to finish off the rest of my ketamine anymore, and I'm the biggest ket fiend I know.

I dropped the tabs 12:00am yesterday with three others where only 1 of them also got the same effects by the tab as I had. He was seriously fucked too, he could literally not say anything other than ""wow"" then if asked why he said wow it'd be something new catch his damn eye. I had to travel home yesterday too from where I was tripping, and at this point it had gone twelve hours. I had abseloutely no problem or anxiety going around in public, though I did feel a slight fair of coming home because the thought about explaining my day to one of my parents is something that got me to trip out and almost spiral into a bad thought pattern that I avoided several times. When I got home about to open my door, I just prayed to myself that I wasn't high anymore. I look down at my phone and it had only gotten worse. Stuff was moving all out of my control. I enter my house and look into my living room where my parents are sitting. They say ""hey"", and I say the same back as I walk past them, while getting a bit freaked out by the way things are moving inour living room, and the face of my dad.

23290,Cannabis,Tripping on weed?,"So 2 days ago I went out with 2 buddies to have a few beers and smoke 2 joints. We ended up meeting 3 new people in the process.

We set outside of the college building where we met up, rolled the 2 joints and started passing them. After a few puffs it started hitting me (I've only started smoking recently so it hits me farely quickly).

After a few short minutes I felt really hydrated and started to feel like I was going to faint my vision even blacked out for a second. So I decided to sit down.

I felt better and decided to put on some music since I always wanted to do it while high.

And then it started. First I felt like I was rolling around in circles while free falling and every time I opened up my eyes it have to ""catch myself"". After that I saw and felt every single part of the song (MA - angle). They were all in different colors and shapes and even felt differently, the bass was constantly stroking my ear drums and kept them warm for example. Once the song ended it stopped so I got up and felt better.

Is it possible to trip on weed, or better yet on a few puffs of weed, or was it possibly laced with something else? The girl we got it from later said they sprayed it with speed, yet all my friends claim it's impossible.

9:30 I took the oral dose of 2C-B

10:30 I smoked some hash.

At this point things were feeling a little underwhelming so at around 11 I decided to snort a little more 2C-B. God damn did that kick it up a notch. Smoked some more hash at 11:30 and god damn man. Laying in my bed I felt layers of myself being peeled away. My body dissolved for a time. And all with such a clear and calm head space. Visuals were decent but not super colourful. Definitely recommend this combo if you're looking for a nice 5-6 hour trip. Next time I think I'll up the dose of the 4-AcO a little. Maybe 18mg while keeping the 2C-B the same. 

Don't think I'll even bother taking 2C-B alone anymore. Like it's nice and all but it just has so much more potential when combining with other psychs. The only other combo I've done was with 50ug LSD which was very different but also incredible. Likely going to try it with MDMA next, and when I've had a proper breakthrough on DMT alone I'll try it with a little bit of that, maybe on top of another 4-AcO/2C-B combo.

But after I experienced my opioid pain medication overdose and flatlined multiple times, was revived with two intramuscular injections of Nar**n from first responders, and realized I am in fact a mere mortal.... I had extreme PTSD and thought I could possibly turn to the World Wide Web and find lots of stories of similar experience to commiserate with. Well, I was extremely disappointed. As common as this epidemic is, there are many rehab/intervention ads available when you google the subject. But not enough real-life experiences being shared. So, I decided to share mine from start to finish. Because it is not a “typical” one (not that any are)... But I want to help anyone who may have experienced an accidental overdose and are left with questions about the experience and post trauma. Here is my story:

I am a generally healthy, 30 year old female residing in Southern California. I am very fit and active, I am successful in a fast-paced career field, and maintain a healthy long-term relationship. Doesn’t sound that odd, does it? Well it isn’t... Besides the fact that I was diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis when I was in my early 20’s In 2008. For those who do not know, it is an Acute, autoimmune disease I will unfortunately have for life. Back in my diagnosis time frame... (I’m cutting the story very short)... The doctors would treat me with short term anti inflammatories to elucidate some of my symptoms. And for the painful symptoms that persisted and prevented this young, early twenty something woman from living a normal life, they prescribed me Vico**n to mask the basic pain so I could lead a somewhat normal life. Well, after a month or so at first on the Vic’s, my colitis went Into remission. I was able to discontinue the pain meds and return to a “normal” life. 

Fast forward 5 years. Suddenly my ulcerative colitis returns with a vengeance. (This disease does that unannounced.) after another colonoscopy I am treated very similarly to the first severe flare. Anti inflammatories for my colon and narcotic pain meds to help me get through daily life. This time they were No**o 10/325’s (the yellows). This is the first time I realized I liked the way they made me feel other than just for pain relief. They made my work days go by faster. My attitude with people was more cheery in general. My tolerance for things that would have otherwise agitated me was much higher. When I again went into remission, I kicked the pain meds once more, but this time I found it quite a bit more difficult. 

Fast forward again. (1 1/2 years ago to be more specific). Colitis returns. Same regimen. Colonoscopy, anti inflammatories, No**co. However, this time I’m under extreme stress in my personal life. I find myself taking more and more the recommended dose of my pain meds and requesting earlier and earlier refills. My doctors catch on, I get cut down, and ultimately cut off completely. By this time my body is completely dependent on No**co. At this point I was up to 12 10/325’s per day. Let me say also, that I am 5’7” and 116lbs (small). My tolerance is now through the roof. I begin buying them on the street and spending thousands of dollars on them. I’ll do anything to keep those withdrawals at bay. My mind and body are obsessed. I need them to function. My tolerance keeps growing. I eventually find a connect who tells me I need stronger pills. Ox**ntin 
 that have more of the opioid and less of the acetaminophen that damages your liver and organs so much. 

So begins that dragon which latches onto my back. I graduate from blowing through a monthly script of 90 10/325 No**os to snorting almost 10 blue 30mg Oxy’s per day. Obviously my body nor my wallet could support this ridiculous habit anymore. I know I need to get off the pills. This is uncommon, especially for my size and weight and the amount of pills i was consuming daily.... But I went through an at-home 7 day detox with the help of a close family member. It was Hell. I was sure I would die. But I did it. I dealt with about a month of post acute  withdrawal symptoms... Such as constant goosebumps, cold sweats, and runny nose, etc. It was not fun but I got through that and at about a month and some change I was free. No cravings for the pills. Energy levels back up. Mental clarity back. Feeling myself for the first time in almost 2 years. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago. If you are reading this as an addict, you know that even if you think you don’t want those drugs or pills anymore, if someone puts one in front of you, you think: “Ahhhh. I’ve been clean 6 months. One dose and a little high isn’t going to put me back into being a full blown addict.” And for some, this is correct. They can relapse once, twice, or a few times and that’s it. Others eat thrown right back down the rabbit hole into the throws of full on addiction again to have to go through the whole awful detox/clean process again. Agony. Anyways, I fall into the: “I’ll just do one for fun because it’s been six months and I have control of this thing.” Well.... I went from ingesting  10-12 30mg blue Ox’s per day in the peak of my habit... To having 1/2 of the same pill, ingested the same way as always (snorting), so yes, that’s only 15mg of Oxy... Literally making me overdose and sending me into respiratory arrest and killing me for about a minute and a half before my heart was shocked back to beating. So, what did merely half of a tablet of the usual stuff I could have previously snorted 10-12 of per day with no incident cause this near death experience? I will begin by saying that no, these pills were not counterfeit or laced with Fen**nyl. They were the real deal. This is what happened:

My boyfriend (a veteran of the US Air Force, only 31 years old himself) and I decided to get sushi and have our normal shared bottle of Saki and beer. We had a very pleasant evening, caught a slight buzz, and headed home. Upon getting home, I hadn’t eaten as much as I normally would have and I was feeling quite buzzed. In my altered state of mind I had a bit of a headache so I took a couple ibuprofen. I take 20mg Lexapro in the evening for the last 6 years for anxiety. I took my usual tablet. This is where it gets foggy:
My boyfriend and I were lying in bed and talking and laughing and enjoying each other’s company. (I remember this clearly.) I generally have trouble sleeping so I decided to take some Amitryptalyne to help my sleep. It is typically safe. In my alcohol induced mind I took 2 tablets instead of one. I vaguely remember quietly shuffling off to snort one last half blue 30mg Oxy pill I still had hanging around. I thought maybe I would get a great night’s sleep. Well, I got the kind I never imagined could even happen to me.

My last memory of the earlier events of that evening were talking to my boyfriend as we were lying in bed. Then nothing. Until I was violently awoken to what felt like a dream state to multiple uniformed men wearing eye protection/large goggles (which for some reason made it scarier) informing me, in what were hitting my dazed ears as warped words, that I had had some sort of an opioid overdose as I was being wheeled out of the front door of my home on a gurney to an awaiting ambulance. Let me just say... Because I have not seen this spoken about before... Waking up from an opioid overdose by Narcan is absolutely a blessing. However, I have read stories that people wake right up and are walking and talking and normal. I woke up violently. Terrified, confused, combative, swinging at the paramedics. I was shaking so violently I thought I may have been having a seizure. My teeth were clenching and chattering and  it hurt to breathe. I was continuing to be confused as I was being wheeled out and the paramedics told me over and over I was having an overdose because all I could manage to say was “this isn’t real”.. It felt still like a dream. But I felt the winter air hit me and saw the awaiting emergency response vehicles and realized this nightmare was a reality. I was put in the ambulance to be transported to the hospital and I told the paramedics how I was in disbelief this was reality. One of the senior paramedics seemed a bit agitated and told me he knew I had overdosed and asked what I had taken. I was still confused as I was barely coming to at this point and processing what was happening. I asked him if he had administered Nar**n to me. He was surprised by me asking this.... I knew, however, from educating myself previously with my over use of opioids what Nar**n is and that it is the holy grail to what will reverse an opioid OD. He looked at me and said: “Yes, I actually hit you with two doses in the thigh via injection, so what did you take??”. All I managed to say was “some Oxy.” That’s all he needed to hear. He had no idea about my history or the fact that I had taken such a minuscule amount this time when other times I had taken amounts that would tranquilize an elephant. He said one more thing: “That guy back there, he your boyfriend?”. I responded with a yes.... He said, simply: “Well he saved your life.”. The puzzle pieces began to come together when I got to the hospital and my boyfriend arrived and I was stabilized and able to talk to him. Approximately 15 minutes after I believe I snorted the half the Oxy he said I just fell asleep. He figured I was tired. He said about 20 minutes after that he was awakened by and odd sound. He said I was gurgling. He was alarmed by this so he listened to me breathing. He noticed I wasn’t taking actual breaths, and when I did, they were labored and non-beneficial. Again... Thank god for his service in the Air Force as his training kicked in. He took my pulse and it was weak. I wasn’t taking breaths. He called 911 and moved me from the bed to the floor where he began to administer CPR compressions. Let me give you a visual here.. Again I’m a 116lb female and my boyfriend is a 280lb 6’5” male who was putting all of his force into administering chest compressions on me. He continued to do CPR compressions until the first responders arrived and took over. If he hadn’t have caught my abnormal breathing or known how to administer proper CPR... I WOULD BE DEAD. Even after the paramedics took over I flatlined and had to be shocked back to life before they administered the Nar**n. So what happened this time that made it different? The perfect storm. Alcohol+sleep meds+Ox**done. It sent me into respiratory arrest. Even though it was a fraction of a dose of Oxy I once would take. My body’s tolerance had lowered and with the other downers in my system.... For lack of a better phrase... I was fucked. Well, I’m alive. Thank God. I was almost another statistic even though I had “beaten my addiction”. Don’t even tempt it, ever. Don’t mix opioids with alcohol. Or benzodiazepines, or any type of sleep meds, or anything for that matter! No matter how experienced you think you are or how many times you have done it before. It just takes that one time. I’m ok. I’m recovering. I have some cracked ribs from the compressions. But that means they worked. It’s more mentally difficult than anything. Nar**n can save you, but it is a violent and unpleasant experience. It’s a miracle drug but certainly isn’t just like smelling some salts and waking from a nap. No, no, no. You are waking very violently from a nightmare, to a real nightmare. The smell of the Nar**n remained with me for a week post overdose and every time I would get a weird whiff I would have PTSD flashbacks. Head my warning: DON’T mix your pain meds with alcohol or anything!! Even a “little” can be enough to kill you. Be smart. Don’t relapse. That short term high is lame and not even worth it. If you aren’t clean, get clean. Stay clean. Just one time can kill you. No one is ever as experienced with this stuff as they think, despite their past. It will catch you off guard. Last but not least, we are all mere mortals. No one is safe. Stay woke. Now I am.

23522,I :love: Drugs,MDMA with my girlfriend,"This is the story of doing mdma with my girlfriend. 

I’m 17 and I live in a small town. I recently relocated as a foreign exchange student after living in big cities in Asia. I met this girl at college and I started to talk to her- she’s the purest country girl you’ll ever meet. Stereotypical perfect girl next door. 

I met her 2 months ago and started dating in the New Year. Ever since relocating I’ve done MDMA twice and it was an incredible experience but nowhere to this. This was also the first time she slept over. 

She wasn’t keen on doing drugs and the most she’s done is weed but she never really got high from it. I didn’t force her to do the mdma but I told her how amazing it was and I Guess she was attracted to the idea of it. 

We dropped half a pill from a reliable dealer around 9pm and then we went back to mine. No one was home and I decided to fill up the bath and light some candles. I connected my phone to the speaker and played some Chopin. We got into the bath and 10 min later it kicked in and we  were in a state of ecstasy and it honestly was the best moment of my life. We became one entity and every touch and kiss was ecstatic and we talked about how much we meant to each other. We got out of the bath and dropped the other half, and that’s when shit got intense. 

Keep in mind, she’s never felt anything like it before and I was there holding her and she kept telling me how there was no “you and me” but it was “us”. It was like nothing mattered in the universe except for us. I told her to close her eyes and roll and I told her a descriptive story about our future and she was in a state of pure bliss. 

I liked her before doing mdma, but after sharing the experience with her, I can confidently say I love her. She looks different in my eyes, like she was attractive but there’s something else in her which causes me to go crazy for her. 

An hour later I dropped a full pill and I started hallucinating and she was there holding me and guiding me and I’ve never felt so free and happy in my life. We stayed awake till 6 am cuddling and talking about how much we mean to each other. We came out the experience as a stronger, more unified and loving couple.

1. Go to the toilet or shower because you will have to pee first.

2. Hold your flaccid dick in one hand and then use your palm to circle around the head of your dick, similar to what you’d do when making a sphere out of clay.

3. You will get the sudden urge to piss. Do it. Empty your bladder completely.

4. Repeat step two, except this time you won’t pee and you can continue circling your palm around your head. It will feel fucking amazing, almost akin to cumming.

I realize that this isn’t the same thing as jacking off, but you can literally do this whenever you feel like it and it is most definitely pleasurable.

I'll be J in this story

This is around 1800 words so you know how much reading it'll be before you get into it. 
________________________________________

So my buddy V and I were drug dealers. Plain and simple. I sold coke. V sold weed. We'd both sell anything else we could get our hands on, too. So one day V calls me and he's like, ""I got fucking robbed J you gotta help me!""

V was the resident tough guy, if I ever had any troubles he had my back so when he asked for help I had to. The story goes he got ripped off on like a quarter pound of bud. I guess he was dealing with someone who he had dealt with before, and the kid brought someone else to the deal without saying anything. My dude V wasn't happy about it but the weed was apparently for that kid and he wanted to see it first. Whatever, tell us next time.

Anyways where they had met was a house on a one way street. V parked his car in the road, had a blunt and the goods prepared, and let the kid see/smoke some of the weed. While the kid has the blunt and he's looking at the weed he pulls a fast one, grabs the bag and books it with the fucking blunt, too. He runs the wrong way down the street. I'm not sure why V didn't just chase him on foot, but he decided to hop in his car and reverse down the street. He was a good driver and probably thought he could make up the distance quick.

As soon as he gets in reverse a cop rolls around the corner. V stops. The cop rolls by, and the kid gets away. This was very sloppy of V. He's usually a lot smarter. V tells the kid who brought the theif to the deal to pay up. The kid swears he wasn't in on that and says he'll do whatever to make it right.

One of these kids is paying V, we don't care who. So we grill the kid that didn't run. V probably pulled a gun on him and got all the details he needed about the theif. His name and address. His mother's name and address. His phone number. His family members phone numbers.

Now V could have called his plug and probably got this kid shot but he didn't want to get anyone hurt so he called me.

We kept calling and calling. Got a hold of the theif. Told him his own address. Told him his mother's address. Threatened him till he was scared shitless. He told us his grandma was gonna bail him out of this and that he'd have the money soon.

His idea of soon wasn't soon enough for us. We told him that we ""told the boss"" what happened and that he was in town and wanted to talk to him.

I was to play the part of ""the boss"" and I was gonna be there when we collected the money. We told the kid where to be. Not to be late. The kid asked V on the phone, ""Is he gonna hurt me"" and apologized profusely. V said, ""I don't know. Just have the money, don't be late, don't make him wait, and be polite like yes sir, no sir type shit and you'll probably be okay""

Now I'm a car guy. I had just picked up and AMG Mercedes S Class. Black on Black. This thing was vicious. In the hood we were in if you saw a car like that it was almost certainly a big name dope boy's that you wouldn't fuck with. Nobody had to know the car was actually 10 years old with 100k miles, it just didn't look that way. This thing had just been buffed and waxed, it glimmered like none other. To anyone who didn't know any better this was still a hundred thousand dollar plus car. I didn't even have plates on it. I took the temp tag off and stashed it away.

There were three of us in the car when we went to pick the theif up. V and I up front, random girl in the back. I had pieced together some jewelry and a nice watch to complete the look. Nice watch, nice cap, everything. I had two bandanas covering my whole face with a slit for my eyes.

When we turned the corner we saw the theif standing outside waiting for us. He saw us too. He saw that car and knew. He about broke his neck looking and shit a brick when we pulled up. A blacked out S Class with no license plates. The kid was visibly trembling.

We rolled up and Vince cracked his window. And motioned to the kid. The girl hopped out of the back and opened the rear right door for him. He got in and she came around to the other side and got back in.

The theif exchanged pleasantries with V with the little hand shake fist bump how's it going kinda thing. V introduced me and said, ""This is Snowman"" The theif said, ""Hello Sir"" to me and held out his hand. I kept my hand resting on the steering wheel and looked straight forward. I said nothing for a very long, dramatic pause. The theif put his hand down and I waited another moment before I said, ""Do you know why you're here?"" in a tone even deeper than my voice is normally. 
He said, ""Yes sir"" and started to apologize. I stopped him. 

Still looking straight forward I say, ""Let me explain something to you""
He trembled and I continued.

I said, ""It's bad enough that you're stealing from V. Fucking up his schedules, he's got rent to pay this week, but do you know who else you're taking from?""

""Yo..you sir?"" the theif studders

""You're taking from my daughter. I do what I do so she can go to college. Do you want her to go to college? Do you want to steal from my daughter?""

The theif starts fumbling an apology out, ""I'm sorry, I didn't realize....""

I cut him off again, ""I can't have anyone taking from my daughter. YOU UNDERSTAND?""

""Ye..yes Sir"" he stammers.

""Now where's the fucking money""

The theif scrambles for his pockets and pulls out a wad of cash and tries to hand it to me.

Still looking forward with my hand on the wheel I shout, ""Hand it to V!""

He hands V the cash and I yell, ""Now get the fuck out of my car before I get mad and don't ever show your face again""

He fumbles out the car and almost falls. We pull away slowly.


Originally we were gonna take his shoes and coat and shit but we figured we had scared him enough. For weeks after I'd be cruising through town and I'd always drive up his block reaaalll slow and make a presence. The kid learned his lesson, V got paid, nobody got hurt, and we had a good laugh. V and the girl said they had no idea how convincing my performance was gonna be. V was like, ""Where the hell did you come up with that shit about your daughter"" (I don't have a daughter) and I said it just came to me. One of the better stories we have now. Always a good laugh. To this day V will look and me and get all serious and be like, ""You tryin' to take from my daughter"" and I'll crack up. ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ai0ns2/the_story_of_snowman/

23802,Psychedelics,My first psychedelic trip was terrifying (UK),"Posting on mobile so apologies for formatting.

My first trip was in August 2017 and I haven’t spoken about it since, My friends in Leeds had invited me to come to leeds festival, so I headed up to leeds and got to their uni house. 
When I got there, there was a cornucopia of drugs laid out on the kitchen table, including: Cocaine, LSD, MDMA, Ketamine and Weed. 
There is about 8-10 of us in the house, one of them was a good friend we will call “T”, he had planned on candy-flipping for the first time and asked if I wanted to try it, I was hesitant but agreed and we headed to the festival.
(Times are estimated)
8:00pm: me and T are impatient waiting for 9:00pm when Eminem was meant to be on the main stage, so we decide to have our first “taster” dose of MDMA crystals and snort about 50mg each.
8:30pm: maybe placebo effect, starting to feel a little...happier.
(The longest 30mins of my life)
9:00pm: Eminem comes out on stage and we proceed to insufflate another 100mg each.
9:20pm-10:15pm: another 400mg each over that time period, in ~75mg repeated doses.
10:30pm: me and T head over to the silent disco rolling hard, this is where we meet another one of our friends “C” who has the acid on him. We both take a 100ug tab.
11:30pm: we all get a bus back, I’m seeing brighter colours and I even searched for 5 mins looking for the air conditioner on the bus, then I realised the window was open. This was quite funny to me at how obvious it was.
11:45pm: all 3 of us take another 100ug tab each, I exclaim that I can handle one more (oh how I was wrong).
12:15am: T,C and the rest are in the kitchen, whilst I’m in the chill room where I had previously setup my laptop, projector and Xbox, with 2 sofas facing the wall the projector was pointed at. I’m starting at the curtains watching the circle pattern slide up and down.
12:20am: everyone enters the room and begins to chill, T is opposite me, C is to my immediate right sat in a camping chair.
12:30am: we fire up the projector and stick on some failarmy compilations to cheer up the people coming down. A joint is rolled and passed around, C tells me that weed takes acid to a new level so I should be aware, regardless I partake.
12:45am: it begins, the colours in the room get a lot darker but yet vivid, greens look like fluorescent mold, I have another joint, then another.
1:15am: from this point on I’m not sure on the time frame so I’m going to bullet point the events that followed in a roughly chronological order.
-  I start seeing spiders that are crawling on the walls.
- people started to look demonic and move like animatronic humans.
- a T-Rex started breathing down my neck.
- a girl to my right turned into the woman in black in my periphery.
- C turned into a willy wonka/carnival type character with long striped pants and a top hat.
- everyone starts putting me on trial and tells me all the bad things that’s happened between each and every one of us (apparently no one spoke).
- the fail videos turned into my bad memories in life and everyone was sat around laughing at them.
- ash on the ashtray turned into flies and started flying around and crawling around on my eyes.
- I fell on the floor and “died” I heard people’s voices saying “come back it’s just a trip, you can come back!”
- when I awoke I was sat in the same position, I saw T across from me cowering in fear under a duvet cover.
- people started to go to bed (which I took as them clearing their beef with me)
- I heard a lot of deep banging around the house, it gets louder and faster then stops at the door, the door opens and 4 GIANT spider legs wrap around the door, an 8ft across spider enters the room, it has a human head and looks at me then disappears.
- it’s then just me and C left tripping (I’m still thinking I’ve died and woken up in a parallel universe) the sun rises and sets about 7 times outside. 
- C puts on a poker tournament on the projector, I’m watching thinking my previous universe friends are trying to get me back my communicating through the moves played in the tournament. At one point I hear another friend “M” shout my name and I shout it bad, C looks at me and says “why did you just shout M?”...I don’t respond.
- Another friend comes back around 8am “J” after staying with his gf, I let him in and ask if he’s the real J, I go into the kitchen with him and I’m saying “I’ll never see you again, you’ve always known me in this universe so you can’t prove you’re the original J” (tears streaming down my face).
- J spends the next 2 hours consoling me whilst I’m balling my eyes out.
- 5 hours later I’m driving me, J and his gf back to Manchester.

Sorry for a long, potentially boring story...I just had to share it.

Tl;dr - had 200ug on a 500mg MDMA comedown, coupled with 2g of weed. Lead into a hellish trip where I thought I died and re awoke in a parallel universe where my previous universe tried to communicate to me through  YouTube video on poker highlights.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ai1tne/my_first_psychedelic_trip_was_terrifying_uk/

Moreover drugs allowed me to heal all the trauma in my life so that I could move forward. These guys are still stuck up on shit that happened to them 10 years ago and letting it control them.

23883,LSD,First time on acid,"To preface, if you're anywhere near my age you should never even consider doing this.


 I'm 16 and still with my parents. Sick of all the shit life is giving me and heard that acid can help with depression and shit. Got ahold of 15 tabs and took one, expecting mild color changes and shit. Doesnt come on for about an hour, so I watch a standup comedy special (Jim Gaffigan: noble ape, which I am aware makes me beyond white). Much funnier as the tab starts to kick in, watch the whole thing laughing the whole time. Went up to my room and the shit starts to really kick in, walls melt, my dog's fur looks like its flowing, everything has patterns and changes colors like a movie, outside my window the forest looked like a kaleidoscope, and even my cup of water has its bubbles create a curl formation on each side, glistening with an array of colors and patterns. (No idea how that works because I'm pretty sure the bubbles didnt actually move to fit a pattern). Listened to one song, then my parents took my phone because I have horrific insomnia. Song was LSD by ASAP Rocky (cliche as fuck). When they took it I didnt have any music or entertainment so I kind of just sat there unable to sleep from 7 pm to 1 am, getting semi-lucid closed eye visuals of some kind of weird shit (not religious but I got some odd glimpse of hell-like imagery and immediately felt a sharp pain/fear run down my spine. Legitimately hurt) and then out if nowhere I get these obsessive, almost OCD thought loops that were all the same and lasted the whole trip; as I remember them they were something like this: 


Typewriter sounds, visuals of something going into a spot like a book entering a line of books with an open spot,




Some kind of figure/person that looks animated talking in a ""old-timey"" fashion (phrases like ""top of the morning to you""),



Seeing myself as a female (weird cuz im a straight dude),


Phrases like your stereotypical 60s smooth dude


A weird ass pentagram with entities at the tips speaking words I couldnt understand, which suddenly all became aware of me and started talking about how I would understand one day,


A repeated, near-real auditory hallucination of a voice saying things like ""close, not quite, maybe, no, there.""


Thoughts of doing absolutely nothing forever (borderline suicidal)



And a shillouette of a comedian on stage saying nothing with laughter erupting from the audience.


Visuals were all closed-eye, got really disturbing to me for no reason at all. Kept forcing themselves into my mind in cleverly intrusive ways. Started to think about the concept of whether or not I exist and eventually the racing thoughts got incredibly uncomfortable, which only worsened the thoughts that I should do nothing forever. The top and bottom half of my body felt detached, every time I left the room it felt really dreamlike and unreal.



And then I looked in the mirror. Stared into my soul. And suddenly, i realized. The dont look in the mirror thing is bullshit lol.


Anyways I fell asleep at god knows what time, and when six in the morning rolled around, I was just glad that I wasnt stuck in a trip forever (I know its impossible but fuck logic I can get high instead).


Would I call it a bad trip? Maybe. Maybe not. It was definitely scary but since then I have seen signs of a significantly better attention span and my depression is weaker. I'll wait a fucking while for the 14 more tabs that I have. Shit.

That way I'm better able to understand what an appropriate dosage would look like for myself.

24355,Psychedelics,What do you guys do on 4-AcO-DMT?,"I've taken 4-AcO-DMT twice and on the come-up I can't figure out anything interactive to do that seems fun. I have taken around 20-25mg each time. Both times, I have started the trip on my couch in front of my TV/PS4 and quickly end up in my bed for the majority of the trip. I haven't had a bad trip on it, but I find normal things like browsing reddit or watching TV difficult for long periods of time. I just lay in my bed and think/go to another realm lol. Do any of you have any suggestions for fun things to do on this drug, or do you guys do the same?

24383,Long Post,900 mg DXM 150 ug LSD 50 mg DMT Experiencing myself as god creating my entire universe,"So i've been meaning to write this one up all week.  I don't trip a lot anymore, I didn't think there were any life shattering experiences left, i had tripped a lot in my early 20's, early 30's now.  This changed my perspective.  

I had recently discovered the glory of robocough.  I'm amazed by this product.  it is so clean, and it really changes the potential of the substance.  This was my second time with robocough, my plan was to do one bottle and if i was feeling like it do a second after I came up.  I had the other psychadelics on me, but I was not planning on ingesting them.

T 0:00 Ingest 450 mg DXM and sit down to watch a doc about slacklining in the mountains.  Its incredible seeing people doing something that they love doing and aren't a slave to society.  The dxm comes on fast and strong w/ robocough.  by the end of the 30 min i decide it is time to down the second bottle

T 0:30 ingest 2nd 450mg of DXM.  pronounced euphoria and confusion.  I loved the documentary so much but i don't know if i'm tripping hard enough yet to just space out to music or if i want to try to find something else to watch.  i decide on trying to find something to watch but i'm having a lot of difficulty dealing w/ my xbox control.  my dog jumps up and starts licking my face and i erupt in laughter.  at that point i just start getting waves of euphoria and say out loud 

""i love life""  

""i love myself""

I deal w/ depression and anxiety and whenever i get confused or something i'll think to myself ""i hate myelf"" and it felt as if my brain was being re-programmed by the drug to not default to those thoughts.  something at that point told me that the universe was going to be sending me a lot of information this evening and that I would need to take a tab of LSD to receive it.  

T 1:15 I ingest 1 tab of 150 ug LSD.  it was sold as 225 but I don't think it is that high.  It is very good quality though.  Taking the tab centers me on the thought that i am receiving information from the universe.  I have a sketch book that i draw in and I take it out and start writing in it.  The universe is telling me that its going to give me rules to live my life by.  Over the next hour i go between my couch and the floor writing rules between my drawings of the flower of life and random tessellations.  and these are my rules:

Rule 1. Only smoke what you grow
(this saves money)
Be your wife's Husband. #2
#3 Smile
But what is number 2?
rule 42 I forget but love is what life is about
2. Love yourself love who you are
5. Family

At this point the LSD is definitely kicking in and i'm getting further and further away from reality.  Its hard for me to tell how much time has passed at this point.  I'm incredibly euphoric at this point and 100% percent convinced that the universe is channeling knowledge into me.  I've never experienced this level of.... buy in? to a trip before.  I've always known it wasn't real, but I was convinced this was real information.  

As i sit on the couch i look at my hand, holding a sharpie off in space.  My arm looks as if it isnt attached to anything and is made out of 2d paper.  The wrinkles in my skin look like a desert canyon while my plants in the background are sinking into the floor.  whenever i close my eyes colorful fractals flow over incredible textures and realities.  I can feel futures versions of myself.  The euphoria that i feel is future me communicating with me.  telling me that i'm making the right decisions and doing the right things.  I'm taking my life in the right direction.  There is more information that I need to receive.  It is time to smoke DMT

This was unplanned, and i've thought about it before and all research says it would be a bad idea.  I'm supremely confident that it was the correct decision and i do not need to fear.  

T 3:30 I go to my cabinent and get some of my weed to smoke.  I decide because of my new rule i should smoke the dmt in a joint.  I have no clue how much dmt i put in the joint.  I put two small shovels but my perception was very distorted at the time.  I'm very surprised i was able to roll it.  

I light the joint and start to smoke it.  i believe i had been smoking prior to this in the trip, but i don't recall.  regardless, i start to trip out a little more, but not that intense.  I look out across the room and i get the heightened sense of spacial awareness and color perception and its definitely intense.  I put the joint down.  my dog is snuggled up next to me and he is so white.  It was so beautiful.  I got the urge to write another life rule.  I stand up and walk over to where my book was on the ground and i see my shadow cast out over the carpet as i fall into a squat and unite with every memory i've ever had and will have, every version of myself that has ever lived throughout history and ever will, and also every lsd trip my father has ever had.  I find it very interesting that my dad's expereinces were connected as well.  I feel the connection through the base of my brain and through my spine.  As if the information was just being fed into my brain through this cosmic connection.  I was transported to many different worlds.  they are impossible to describe and ifinitely complex.  They all had a theme though, passing on of knowledge, particilarly through my father.  I was first a bear / mole animal with his father in the psychadelic forrest showing the world, then two monkies eatting psychadelic mushrooms.  The most noteable ones were becoming blue egyptian gods performing some sort of ceremony then the final vision that I can remember was the most impactfull.  A giant native american in psychedelic blue was running through the dessert with a large staff.  The native american represented all of my ancestors, but also a was a representation of the human consciousness and its connection with our earth.  This native american slammed his staff into the ground down through my spinal column connecting me with the infinite wisdom of our planet and our species.  I had one more message.  I scribbled out trip with dad.  i look at the page as i come in and out of reality.  The symbols aren't recognizable but the message is clear.   It also connected with a trip my dad had where he wanted to trip with his son.  The universe was telling me all the world's problems would go away if people just tripped with their dad's again.  It has been a right of passage for a large part of the evolution of humans, something that is lost.  If all sons goals in life was to trip with their dad the world would be a better place.  

As This information was being delivered to me, as the giant native american slammed his staff into the earth i return to my body.  pulsating with energy i'm a glowing ball of gold.  similar in a way to fishing out on nitrous.  i know that my purpose is to re introduce the right of passage of the psychedelic experience to my father and it will open the gate to a new world.  i'm slammed back into my body and i jump up from my squat ecstatic.  I felt as if all the love in the universe was surrounding me.  I laugh and cry in ecstasy.  i run around my house with my dog.  My dog is a guide for the ancient consciousness.  he has helped guide me to this infinite knowledge and i thank him for it.  

T 6:00 At this point it is midnight and i'm still tripping very hard.  I came down from the dmt and have the urge to do it again.  I go to roll another joint but in doing so i honestly have no clue how many times i had smoked dmt.  Had it only been one joint?  or did the first one not work, and then did i roll a second one that did work?  or had there been three?  I couldn't figure it out so i decided not to.  I layed down and was taken to one of the most visually diverse set of CEV's i've ever had.  Alien machines, landscapes, things i can't describe all pulsating before my eyes.  I couldn't really listen to music as I was a little exhausted from the dmt but laying in silence i was able to receive more information.  The universe was telling me that i am my own god; i create the world around me with my emotions.  If i am happy and full of love that is what i will bring into my life.  Part of the love that i need to bring in to my life is with my family.  I made plans with my dad to take two weeks to go roadtrip to vegas.  He is getting old and it will probably be the last time we get to do something cool like this.  

And you bet i'm bringing lsd. ",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ai5hzf/900_mg_dxm_150_ug_lsd_50_mg_dmt_experiencing/

24448,Psychedelics,First time trip and we were way over our heads,"I'm going to start this with stating the doses

3 people had
Acid: 150 ug each
Mushrooms: 3.5 - 5g each

I've been wanting to trip for some time now and the opportunity came up, what the dose was suppose to be at the begining was not what we ended up taking due to only being able to buy the shrooms by the ounce (we finished the bag)

At first we planned on just chilling and playing some smash, Mario kart, and eventually making it to nature documentaries. And it was all going well. We all popped a tab and ordered some pizza, and God was that the tastiest pizza I ever had, the colours tasted so good, the pepperoni was super bright and eye catching, the yellow pineapple went so well with it, and the honey that was on my plate tasted delicious.

At this point you might be wondering why the hell there was honey on my pizza, and that's a good question... We covered the mushrooms in honey so we wouldn't have to taste them, and it worked, I tasted nothing but honey. At this point I wast talked into taking the mushrooms that I decided were a bad idea a few days before.

I agreed to take 2 grams, I had like 3.5

We went outside to my buddy's car and they had a smoke (weed) I wasn't feeling it so I didn't.

We get back inside and out of the rain.

There's still another eighth in this ziplock bag and I tried to convince my buddy to eat it, he's tripped before but he refused until I convinced him to eat some more so he has another gram ish, then stops. We went back outside but I forgot my jacket so I ran back in to get it. Feeling the effects now I pull all the change out of my pocket and draw a circle around it on the pizza box (I didn't want to spend it?) all this time in trying to separate colours and sounds, and rembering people have 2 eyes.

On the way out of the house with my jacket on I finish the rest of the shrooms without any honey (they didn't taste great at all, kinda like paper), then we went back inside.

Once we get back in we head to the couch, at this point I'm losing my ability to communicate ideas, but I know I want to walk, and for some reason The couch gets tiny while my lanky friend turns into Buddha. For some reason I just can't sit on the couch, there's some sort of force that just won't let me, it feels like a cunning and malicious animal, kind of like a fox. So I keep trying to get these guys to go for a walk, walking back and forth between the couch and the door.

I know I'm God, and there is a plan and an end goal, and I'm going to make that happen, I'm saving my friends from the couch.

While I finaly sit down Becuase I'm dragged to the couch by the force of democracy (me and my 2 friends make up this universal force in my head) hotel California starts playing. My house turns into the hotel California, and it is not a wonderful place, I need to save them. I end up convincing one buddy that nature will look cool as shit, and the rain will feel awesome (this is all true to me) so he stands up.

Democracy has changed, the two against one that made me sit has swayed to get the last guy off the couch, so we head upstairs and get ready for a walk.

While I'm waiting outside one guy went to pee and the other is putting on his shoes. This was when everything changed. Constant giggling and laughing ended. The guy that was putting on his shoes yells ""Fuck this"" and bolts out the door, jumps in his car and takes off. Me being God was not a good thing, Becuase even though I got everyone out of the house one of us went a little too far a little too fast.

The guy that was in the bathroom comes out side to me just mouth wide open saying that our friend just left.

But hey, I was God, I could fix this, we just had to go get him, if he crashed it's on me, God, to go save him and help bring him back. So me and my friend start walking up the street in the pooring rain while he's freaking out telling me that we have to go back to the house, the house is safe, I'm thinking if I killed him I have to save him.

Eventually I'm convinced to go back, both of us convinced we just killed our friend go back to the couch and debate what were going to do, my friend is freaking out saying that this is reality and we need to go to bed and when we wake up he'll be back. He never came back, and we can't sleep, and we don't know if he was even ever real. Now my drive to go save him is gone, he's dead, so trying to comfort my friend I convince him it was all my fault because I was a bad God.  That did not help me mentally. I went to hell, a hell designed for failed God's.

I saw the universe ending, the universe ended because I fucked up as god. My friend that died was at the center of it all, all of the universes were dying because of my choice of taking everyone for a walk. I ended up in loops of taking my last breath and having my throat cut or pulled out, I was drowning, but I couldn't die or go to sleep, I couldn't find comfort, I didn't know what comfort was. I was stuck in constant loops knowing I was one step from getting out but I couldn't escape hell. All my thoughts were in Spanish but I don't speak Spanish, I lived many lives and I always died as punishment for killing my friend. The couch in that room became all that was left in the multiverse. People I knew were coming in, my friend, my mum. And even though it was all real I didn't know.

After waking up from hell I was still mute, I couldn't talk, I didn't even know if I was in real life or just the next step of hell.

When I was finaly able to speak my slightly more lucid through this told me what was going on.

He asked some sober friends to come check up on us (the one that I imagined showing up) and he put on a  deap sea nature documentary and Narcos (explained my drowning and Spanish hell) then he sent him away to prove that he was real. Our friend was alive and at his house knocking everything over. My mum did come back and she gave me a bottle of water, but it was a vodka bottle filled with water and I want about to touch that In my state.

All in all, we all ended up going to our own unique hells. But came out of it alive and more focused on school.

My mum was getting mad at us saying that we're going to get addicted to acid(she didn't know about the mushrooms) . I don't know how anyone could get addicted to that.

Advice to anyone wanting to trip for the first time, stick with one, and stay on the couch

Tldr; we went to hell and back after our friend ran away making us think we killed him, and I was punished as God for killing my friend. ",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ai5wbn/first_time_trip_and_we_were_way_over_our_heads/

24530,Cocaine,"Some questions about shooting coke. I can't quite ""figure it out"" for lack of a better way of phrasing it.","I've got a lot of experience with drugs, but since I got into shooting coke instead of smoking crack, (heroin is my main drug of choice,) I have had some enigmatic experiences. 

I have done shots ranging from .05 up to a whole dub, .2, and I have had times where I felt none of those amounts, and times where a shot as small as .07 hit me hard enough to make me nauseous. I have had my fair share of missed shots, but what I am referring to above is only shots where I've gotten a vein and hit. In addition, an obvious suggestion might be that some of the coke was garbage, but I got into shooting it through friends, and I was always getting what they already had and tried and confirmed was good. Some of these experiences were even with the same batch. Earlier tonight I shot a dime that I even missed a tiny bit of and I was geeked out, and I just shot about .13 of the same stuff and got a hit and literally felt nothing. Checked my pulse with my phone, was 61, and no lump from a miss or burning sensation.

24751,Deliriants,"The right way to get high on diphenhydramine - harm reduction, doses and tips from an experienced usee","I know that this post will cause a lot of controversy here, I know a lot of people won't like it and some even may hate it.

To those of you who dislike deliriants or dph, I must clarify that the purpose of this post IS NOT TO PROMOTE DPH, but aimed to help those who do this drug to at least follow a ""less dangerous and healthier path"". So I respectfully ask you to avoid negative and not constructive comments. Of course constructive argumen is totaly welcome.

So now for those of you that will try dph despite of all the warnings... I must say, from a fella that has done dph for a while now and that is on ""your side"", deliriants are great and very interestin/fun but THEY ARE VERY DANGEROUS ALSO, so I wanna give you some info and tips, from my personal source and experience, and also a sumary of all the info I've read about dph throught the past years. Also I am a health care professionals (however do not take this as a doctor advise).

REAL DANGERS OF DPH:

☆ If you go too far, it can be a fuckin nightmare and really scare your shit to a level you can't imagine. I think one of the issues with dph bad trips is bevause people take high doses too early and get overwhelmed. So I recommend new users to go really slow from low doses to high. I consider this to be a good increasin plan, you start with a low dose and as long as you are comfortable with the level you are in, you go further:

1. 200 mg or maybe 150 if you are nervous.

2. 300-350 mgs till you are confident, some people have some hallucinations at thjs point.

3. 550 mgs, this will likely be potent.

4. Go 600 - 700 and I wouldn't go any higher than 700 if you don't want to be fried for months (stupid after the trip).

☆ Stupiditi after the trip, this is a real thing, depensing on your dose you will feel mentally slow and fogged from around 5 days to a month of even more (higher doses).

I think the best way to prevent this is to try to lower the dose as much as posible.  Some people take vitamins and antioxidants prior to the trip to protect the brain a bit. This does work, maybe it is just placebo but I recommend this if you can.

One way to really lower the dose and still get crazy hallucinations is to take the dph with some dxm (dextrometorphan), this for example, taking the famous 300/300 dose may give you hallucinations similar to 700 mg of dph alone. So this may be a good way to be safer due to taking less drug.

I WILL WRITE A POST ABOUT THE RIGHT WAY TO TALE DPH+DXM, in case you are interested in tryin it or not able to make or work.

☆ Addiction, even tho the ad potencial is low because most people dont enjoy the experience, some people (like myself) get hooked like crazy, I've always spaced my dph as far apart as posible... but I know people, and you can read some experiences here on reddit too, where people get high on it every fuckin day for like months in a row. And that my friends, is very bad news.

This point includes both the ""stupidity after trip thing"" and the addition. We still dont really know much about the damage dph causes, but there seems to be a very interesting coorelation between ""stupidity after trip"" ans frecuency of use, and this seem to cause even more damage than high single doses. I AM TALKING  ABOUT FUCKIN YOUR BRAIN ALMOST FOR LIFE.

So basically space your doses as far apart as posible, do it only once in a while on a special occasion.

☆ DELIRIUM IS JUST A FUCKIN CURSE, BE READY

Delrium doesnt only mean hallucinations, it also means that you lose your ability to detect stuff that is not coherent to what you percieve. Kind of like in a dream, in which crazy things happen lets say ""alien bananas"" and you dont realize it is not real even tho it doesnt make any sense.

This sound weird but what I mean is, you won't be able to tell if anythin is real, so you literally cant know whats going on in any way and you temporally become kind of not too aware of your surroundings... which can be very dangerous, as some people for example go outside, drive or hurt themselves in their houses because they're just in other world so:

PREPARE THE TRIP AREA, NOTHING DANGEROUS, ,NOTHING THAT CAN BE CONFUSED AS FOOD OR DRINK BUT IT'S ACTUALLY SOAP OR SOMETHING. TRY TO SET A NICE PLACE AND ALWAYS HAVE A TRIPSITTER OR YOU CAN LITERALLY KILL YOURSELF.

Probably last thing as this is already getting too long. I once had a horrible experience that gone too far and all thanks to the delirium, if you want the details check the post but basically I only wanted to redose 100 mgs, but once I did it, it would just not get registered in my memory so I would think I have not redoses, so redose los 100 I wanted and then forget and do it again multiple times till I was done with the blister and it certanly got over the +1000 mg  and it was awful. IT IS VERY HARD TO ""REDOSE"" AND MANAGE DRUGS WHILE YOU ARE ON DPH, SO BE SURE TO TAKE EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO TAKE AT ONCE AND THEN HIDE YOUR LEFTOVERS IN A SAFE PLACE (OR MAKE THE TRIPSITTER DO IT).

YOU CAN EASILY TAKE THE WRONG DOSE OF ANY DRUG OR EVEN NOT IDENTIFY WHAT YOU ARE TAKING. YOU CAN OVERDOSE OR END UP TAKING THE WRONG DRUG OR SOMETHIN TOXIC BY ACCIDENT.

I hope this post helps, if you gor any question please ask, and remember you only have one brain, dont risk it.

24766,Stimulants,Need some advice on amphetamine and 5-HTP,"Wassup my fellow druggas. Im rolling this Saturday and have bought some tryptophan for supplementation. Now, from what I’ve heard, I want to supplement a couple days before the roll, probably until friday night and a couple days after. Now combining serotonin releasers or reuptake inhibitors with 5-HTP or Tryptophan is dangerous because of the infamous seratonin syndrome. I take dexamphetamine for my ADHD everyday and I know it acts primarily on NE and DA but it does hold of some minimal seratonin activity. Am i at risk of seratonin Syndrome if i take my dex in the morning and tryptophan at night, please help me understand the interactions.

24785,Cannabis,Got stiff neck muscles after smoking weed.,"Vaped some bud last night. Good high. During the course of being high, my back neck muscles were quite stiff and kinda painful. Then I went to sleep. Woke up and it appears that I still have some of that stiff back neck muscle. It's kind of a subtle pain right now.

What caused the weed to highlight this? I have been smoking for a while and I never felt this before.

24795,Stimulants,How I got deported from Thailand,"This is a true story. I am posting this purely as a warning to others, and to warn the people watching me on the corner not to fuck with me. This year Halloween fell on a weekend...

It was summer of 2006 and I was working at a hotel in Phuket, Thailand. It was a really sweet gig, free wifi, thai pussy practically on demand and decent pay. Not to mention the beaches were quite nice. Like it was some really ghetto fabulous shit. Basically I see a flyer in the hotel lobby one day advertising a British expat karate tournament. This sounded like a great opportunity to show off my impeccable no touch knockout skills and mastery of Chi energy. 

The day arrives and I'm feeling like a real muthaphakkin G. I know what I'm going to do to these guys. I believe it, I concieve it and I achieve it. All I needed was a bit of help from my medicine cabinet. I pop open a bottle of Ritalin and just cock my head back and down the whole thing. I feel fucking amazing. Its like jesus christ himself has just given me a mind blowing life affirming blow job. I head off to the tourney.

First thing I'm matched up against this little Russian twink. Hes like 5""5 built like a rake. I can barely even focus like my hands are shaking uncontrollably and my jaw is grinding up and down like I'm having a seizure. Fight starts and I KO this clown with a viscous head kick from the gods. Score 1 for the bad guy. Problem is, I'm a little too hyped and I jump on this bitch boy and pound his face. End up breaking his jaw. Then I break free from the angry crowd and just run and run and run. 

Next thing I know the 5-0 are knocking on my door.... what is love ",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ai7yfi/how_i_got_deported_from_thailand/

24871,Psychedelics,Mushrooms made me their bitch,"Long Post TL;DR: At the bottom

This happened one week ago, and it’s the story of how I quite literally shattered my life, after eating 3.7 grams of Cambodian Cubensis Mushrooms. In order to properly understand many aspects of the whole experience I’ll give you a bit of backstory.

DMT was my go to substance over the course of the last 4 months or so, and man I fucking loved it, it was just so weird... I felt like I was exploring a whole new world, taking what bits and pieces I could and bringing them back with me to this reality. I’ll get into my mushroom experience shortly but what I’m about to explain greatly affected the overall outcome of my mushroom trip and honestly maybe even my life. 

So as I stated previously, DMT was my new found love. I would use it in binge-ish ways, smoke it 4 or 5 times in a day or two, and then wait a few weeks. And over the course of about 4 months, I actually managed to put down all other drugs and solely focused on the occasional DMT experiences. There was always a key element to my DMT trips though, a reoccurring entity, I referred to him as a jester because out of all of the other similar DMT experiences I’ve read of, this was the best representation of the being that I could relate to. 

Now this jester, he wasn’t kind. He wasn’t one of the all loving DMT entities you often hear of, no, infact, he had some real sinister vibes to him. Creeeeepy smiles, he would flip me off in every trip, at first I was able to disregard him, but he began to become the main attraction, and there was no escape. I still loved DMT, even despite this unsettling entity that had been manifesting itself into my tripping dimension. I had given DMT a break for a few weeks as I usually did, but I’d began to speak about this jester openly to some friends of mine. I wanted to see what his purpose was, why was he creating such a dark mysterious presence, I believe now that I was building him up in my subconscious, giving him all sorts of power... But none the less, I decided that when the time was right I’d set out for a DMT experience in which my intent would be to confront this intriguing creature, and see what all the fuss was about. 

In the middle of this planning though, I came across a good deal on some Cambodian Cubensis mushrooms, and I decided what the hell, let’s give it a go. SPOILER ALERT: DISRESPECT TO PSYCHEDELICS ABOUT TO COMMENSE. For some reason beyond me even now, my idiot mind convinced myself I’d be okay to eat 3.7 grams of these mushrooms at midnight in my fucking grandparents house after they went to bed. No need to harp on me, I’m an idiot, a total scummy fuck, the level of disrespect towards family and psychedelic drugs was at an all time high, I’ll admit that to the fullest, but it’s what I did. 

Anywayssss.... So this all went down last Saturday night/early Sunday morning. 

11:30 PM: I ground up the 3.7 g’s of mushrooms and placed them in a bit of lemon juice, let it sit for 20 minutes while I stirred occasionally. 

(I’d eaten mushrooms twice before this event, first time eating 1.7 g’s, second time eating 1.9. Why did I decide to up the dose so heavily? Well, I’d been breaking through on DMT on the semi-regular and figured there’s no way that mushrooms could match that level of intensity, or, because I’m a fucking dumbass, both of which are accurate.) 

11:50 PM: Down the whole lemon tek shroomy smoothie in two gulps and go and put “The good dinosaur” on, on the tv while I waited for the trip to begin. I did what any good wannabe psychonaut would do and prayed to the mushroom before it kicked in lol. 

12:10 AM: I’m already feeling the mushrooms, it’s already reached the level of my peaks of my other two previous mushroom trips. I stand up and laugh hysterically at the chair in the living room because of how small it suddenly looked, typical shroom stuff ya’know? 

12:15 AM: Effects are strong, the blinds on my windows are breathing rapidly, I’m completely unable to focus on “The good dinosaur” and it’s starting to seem very weird... I decide to grab my headphones and go outside and lie under the stars. I gathered my blankets, a sweatshirt I rolled up to use as a pillow and put my headphones on and walked to the backyard where I found a nice spot to lie down. As I lied down and looked at the stars they were moving so rapidly, it was beautiful. I was listening to an EDM group called The Glitch Mob and it was so intense and amazing at the same time, the song changed to a less upbeat song and that’s when things began to go south... All of a sudden something begins to form within the night sky, it wasn’t clear to me immediately but I could sense that whatever forming’s presence had a dark vibe to it. As soon as I recognized the sinister feel, I’m intensely brought into complete DMT like visuals and the fucking jester was right in front of me. I was not ready for this at all, and I instantly felt a strong anxiety building. I decided to head inside immediately. I threw my blankets and nearly ran inside.

12:30 AM: I’m back inside and honestly I felt like I was on DMT, not a light dose either, when I closed my eyes I was in a complete entity filled DMT world. I remember seeing a carousel of beings with card bodies (like from Alice in wonderland) all spinning in circles. My headphones were playing Jimi Hendricks now, and on a lighter note, a caricaturish version of Jimi was playing the guitar on a tiny island like piece of land floating all throughout hyperspace. But at the bottom of my view of this world was the Jester, only this time, it was a trio of jesters. The main male jester, one older female jester, and one younger female jester. They didn’t have smiles like usual this time, instead they had very detailed frowns and it was quite unsettling. The world was exactly what I’ve pictured in previous DMT trips and have described as a dark and vast neon game-scape. Infinite patterns forming, in a way that seemed to be “put on” or “presented” for me by these dark jesters. I figured, although I wasn’t prepared to confront the jester (well now jester’s in the plural sense) in this trip, I did previously set an intent to do so and if I’m presented with the opportunity now, why not take it up. 

12:45 AM: I’m lying on the couch, gripped with the unexpected task at hand. “What the fuck does this being want?!”. I closed my eyes and was back in the DMT realm, sure enough the jester and his two female sidekicks were there at the bottom, I focused on them as unnerving as it was, all of my attention was set directly on them. “What do you want?” I asked out loud, I received no reaction what so ever, but I was still determined. “WHAT DO YOU WANT? Please tell me!” I said once again but now in a more stern tone. After the second time I questioned them, I still received no answer, however, they began to shrink, as if they were retracting into the placeless void from which they originally emerged. Smaller and smaller they shrunk until, poof... they were gone. “I did it!” I thought, I had confronted the manifestation of this being somehow and defeated it I guess you could say! I was still immersed in this world but the jester was nowhere to be seen/felt! I remembered though, it hadn’t even been an hour since I’d eaten the mushrooms, and I should probably get to my room before I was tripping so hard that I’d be unable to do so. This is when things took a very dark turn...

1:00 AM: I get into my bed and try to get comfortable, I’m still listening to music but it’s getting harder and harder to focus on, I’m unable to explain the visuals I’m seeing, and my head space is becoming more and more confusing. I decided to take my headphones out.

1:09 AM: I look at my phone and suddenly realize, I could no longer comprehend time. I knew I had taken the mushrooms right before midnight, but I could not put together how long ago midnight was, I knew my trip would last around 4-6 hours but I no longer knew how hours worked, I thought, “I’m losing it... I’ve really dug myself into something now. How will I be able to handle this?”. What did I do you might ask? I’ll tell you what I did. I called my fucking mom. Face palm moment of the century ladies and gentlemen, the idiot 21 year old called his god damn mom at the peak of a sanity ending mushroom trip. But let’s not forget my setting, while I was on the phone with my mom I made it clear that I needed to be picked up. However, I remembered I was at my grandparents house, and seeing as my mom wouldn’t be there for at least 30 minutes I decided to make matters even worse. 

1:15ish: I burst into my grandparents room, “Help! I ate some mushrooms and I need help!!” My grandparents are so startled, they recognized my fear however and were extremely supportive. I kept asking them “Am I going to die?” They would reassure me that I wasn’t and that I was just having a bad trip. 

I’d like to just say that “Having a bad trip” is the biggest fear for nearly everyone when using psychedelics so to hear out loud that I was having one was shattering to me. I realized they were right, and I don’t fault them for saying that obviously because they were completely right, but to have this presented to me in the midst of it was an experience unlike anything I’ve ever encountered. And it was horrifying. Anyways back to the story. 

1:30ish: My mom had called my dad who lived closer to my grandparents house and he had just arrived, I heard the doorbell ring and ran downstairs to see who had come. I saw my dad and felt instant happiness at its purest form. I hugged him but at the this point I’d completely forgotten I’d eaten any mushrooms, I forgot who I was, or where I was, all I knew was my dad was there and I loved him. I told him this and he gave me a big smile, I began reciting any word that came to mind and it would present itself in my mind as I was creating it for the first time. “Love, happiness, the universe” I was now the creator, I recited the names of everyone I knew. Usually putting an “I love” before their name. But I also recited some negative things, “Jail, prison, hell” and seeing as how I was now the creator, I was in those places, my dad tried to sway me into a positive direction. I do actually remember him saying to me “You know, I’ve tripped on mushrooms on those same exact stairs when I was around your age” lol. My mom arrived in the middle of this whole fiasco. 

1:45ish: My mom and her boyfriend arrive, I recognized her but was nearly too far gone at this point to give a proper greeting. I was now lying in the middle of the floor, completely separated from reality, unable to mutter anything that made the slightest bit of sense. Everyone agreed it’d be best if I went and stayed at my moms for the rest of the night. I do not remember this part too well, but I guess as we were walking to my moms car, I allowed myself to fall freely onto the sidewalk, successfully fucking my face up, I chipped a tooth, bit through my lip, and have now been told after getting X-rays that I also fractured my jaw during this fall. I guess I was bleeding profusely and my parents in a panic decided to take me to the emergency room. Hospitals and psychedelics, they go together like toothpaste and orange juice...

2:30 AM: I remember being in the emergency room lobby, however I did not know at the time that it was the emergency room. Instead I had entered a state of rapid repetition of emotions that was beyond my control, I would feel extreme happiness, followed by extreme sadness and fear, that was then followed by a state a extreme motivation to break free from this horrible loop. I began to convince myself that the happy and motivated states in this infinite loop were nothing but a mere illusion to spread false hope of escaping from the inevitable hellish wave I would soon feel. I no longer felt like I was in this world, I did not know who I was, nor where I was, I clearly had no control over my feelings, I began to realize at the time that I was in a game, and that game was hell. It was terrifying, and I had no way of knowing that it would soon be over. Apparently, it was taking forever at the emergency room, and at this point I had stopped bleeding so my parents decided it was a better idea for me to get the hell out of there than it would’ve have been for me to stay there. Thank god for that decision, had that not been the conclusion they came to there’d be a great chance that instead of typing this right now, I’d be in a gown and gripped socks at the fucking psych ward. 

3:30 AM: “We got into my moms car, apparently she had her dog with her and I didn’t realize it on the way to the emergency room, but I remember being in the back seat of her car and touching the dogs face, as soon as my hand made contact the world became bright, I was out of my hell loop, and was filled with love and bliss. Dogs are fucking incredible. On the drive to her house I was apparently back to my creator of the universe state and was reciting anything I god damn pleased. But I also found something that would bring me back to who I was and that thing was to sing. So I would go from muttering random to words to an angelic (to me) hum. I can’t imagine for the life of me how ridiculous this must’ve sounded, my mom later admitted to me that even despite her adamant irritation for the whole ordeal her and her boyfriend couldn’t help but crack a little laugh towards the sheer absurdity of my antics. 

4:15 AM: We arrive at my moms, I’m slowly starting to come back to reality, however, I’m unable to recollect how I’d gotten to my moms house. And given the fact I was still tripping, my mom looked entirely different than how I’d ever remembered seeing her. I looked in the mirror and saw how much of a bloody mess I was and I started to panic. “How did I get here?!” To which she would reply, “You ate a bunch of mushrooms.” This was not the answer I was looking for. And so what I subconsciously did at the time, was create an alternate reality. I now believed that I was force fed mushrooms by this woman in front of me who wasn’t actually my mom, but was instead some captor keeping me for reasons I did not know. I began to freak out and call whoever I thought could help. I called my grandparents, surprisingly they answered. “Help me grandma, I don’t know what’s going on but I need help” to which she replied “You’re just on mushrooms try and get some rest.” What the fuck! I thought, the alternate universe was true, and I WAS force fed mushrooms! HUGE FUCK UP COMES NOW. I FaceTimed my girlfriend... now let’s not forget I’m covered and blood and clearly still tripping in a horribly frantic state. She answered and I told her I needed help, she saw my bloodied up and swollen face and could barely recognize me, I scared her to death. My mom thankfully texted her letting her know I was on mushrooms. But that clearly didn’t repair the damage that was done by that one horrific FaceTime.

I slowly came to after that and by six in the morning I was relatively sober. But filled with dread after coming to the conclusion that everything that had happened was real. It’s been one week since that happened and I’m still dealing with the repercussions. Fucked up lip/chin, chipped tooth, went to the hospital on Thursday and found out I had a fractured jaw. My girlfriend decided she needed to take a break from me which I don’t blame her for. I’ve decided to put down psychedelics, I’d already put down all the other drugs but now it’s time for me to put down the psychs as well. I’m focusing on how to get back to a healthy place and it’s getting a little better every day. But man oh man... talk about a bad time. Don’t be like me guys. Plan your shit well, and if you smoke a lot of DMT be ready to go back to that realm. All of this could’ve been avoided had I put into place the measures towards having a wonderful and safe experience. 

TL;DR: Mushroom induced psychotic episode at a family reunion leading to fucked up face, broken jaw, and break up.

24886,Psychedelics,What do you guys think about this psychedelics theory?,"this is what I “realized” after one of my 4aco-dmt trips.

I could feel my brain working **so fast** because of the amount of substance that you give it (instead of the indigenous serotonin that’s relatively released *slowly*). compare it to Einstein’s equation that describes: *the more your vehicle approaches the speed if light, the slower your reality gets*. I think it’s the same thing.

your brain is processing information hundreds of times faster than usual. thus your reality/time seems slower.

not sure if this is legit, but that’s how I felt it is.

this could also explain why your get a breakthrough on much higher doses and time stops, because your brain is treating information with an inexplicable speed, so it seems like it’s forever and your brain creates its own reality

24907,Psychedelics,A friendly reminder to never underestimate the acid.,"Hello! I'm here with another LSD experience I recently I had.

Before I start this I would like to mention that the person this happened to was an experience tripper, just because it never has happened to you doesn't mean it won't

To start this off my friend Leroy (fake names obviously), and my friend Eric had picked me up and we went to our usual smoke spot, Leroy had dropped nearly 5 minutes before picking me up, and was the only one to have taken acid so we were getting to the spot before it kicked in.

Once we arrived Leroy was moaning a lot of didn't seemed to be having a good time. He would say that he wanted me and Eric to talk and when we would talk he would tell us to stop. Everything was said to him was met with a ""I don't know, I don't care, stop"". He kept assuming us of doing ""something"" yet we were just chilling and talking and smoking, he attempted on several occasions to empty his wallet and give us all him money. He exited the car and sat next to it for a while until it seemed to experience had stopped.

After this episode he would exit the vehicle and talk to EVERYONE saying stuff that wasn't relateable to anything that was happening and repeating himself over and over, we managed to get him inside of the car and take some few dabs with us, he was sitting in the driver seat when he randomly started punching the shit out of Eric, Eric has been in multiple fights and isn't the kind of person to not hit back if you attack him yet he took it. Leroy ended up exiting the car due to his ""loop"" he was caught in of going in and out of the car. I slipped into the driver seat from the back, me and Eric sat in the car while Leroy screamed and screamed and screamed saying stuff like ""Let this kill this n, fuck you, I want to die, just fucking kill me, get this n off of me"" for a solid 3 hours. Eventually I had enough, I tried talking to him again (after several attempts) to shut up, that he was scaring people and that the cops would be called if he didn't stop, he didn't seem to understand anything I was telling him.

During the first attempt of calming him down he started to legitimately throw hands with me, I got him in a head/arm lock and told him to calm the fuck down or I'd break his arm, he stopped his actions, yet kept screaming.

During the second attempt of me calming him down, I turned around of a moment to talk to Eric and Leroy hit me in the back of the head, I wasn't fucking having it and I turned around and punched him the jaw and he backed up real quick and got defensive, when I tried to go back to car he grabbed me by my hair from the back(as we both have pretty length hair) so I grabbed his hair and didn't stop punching his head until he let go.

After this fight happened me and Eric decided it was best if I put everything ""illegal"" in a bag and leave while he talked to the cops. Good thing I did, not even a block away I pass a cop car going directly towards them, I get a few blocks away and I see three cop cars fly down the road with their lights on, followed by an ambulance and a firetruck.

I wasn't here to experience this but this is what happened from my friends words

He started to swing of police and almost got tased, the police thankfully knew he was acid and injected him with some form of sedative that knocked him out in about 10 seconds. He was taken to the hospital and released the next day.

Me Eric and Leroy are all good friends and would never act this towards each other. This was not normal behavior for Leroy and I hope that everyone the decides to take acid, Leroy is doing alright now and is getting rest :)",54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ai9as4/a_friendly_reminder_to_never_underestimate_the/
24928,Psychedelics,So I got ripped off 150usd of cardboard squares today.,"So today I got ripped of $150 USD in LSD. 

I am so pissed right now that I had to share.
So last Wednesday I brought a ten strip of 100ug acid for around 150USD (not in US but in a Asian country). So this guy who I considered a friend even if I didn't talk to him a lot convinced me he had some really good tabs. We set up a deal and he sent me pics of the tab. In the picture I see some little homemade blotters and a syringe (this will become relevant later). Because of this I asked if he dosed the tabs himself, he said he didn't and that it was his guy as his guy had the ug measuring device. Which in hindsite is redflag number one as there is no such thing as a ug measuring device, ( I know there may be some super sensitive scales are whatever but with acid you normally just dilute it in liquid and drop in a know concentration hence I assumed the string). Anyways as I considered him a ""friend and trustworthy"" I decided to buy it anyways. He gave me a extra ""half tab"" which was odd but I just assumed he had leftovers. It came wrapped in tinfoil and he told me to keep it in the freezer. Anyways I gave two tabs to a friend who said he didn't get any effect. I told the dealer about it and he said that I should try it and if it's not working he will refund me in full. So today I decided to drop a tab. It had no taste really small blotter and not smell or sensations so I assumed it was real acid and kept it under my rouge for two minutes before swallowing.

After a couple hours I realized nothing was going to happen and I decided to shine the tabs with a blacklight and obviously there was nothing on the tabs. I messaged him and said hey. Within 1 minute he blocked me on all social media. Anyways I'm fucking pissed and I relized that he was a junky and that needle was probably  for shooting up as he sent me pics of him smoking H out of a tinfoil boat a year back.

I didn't know what to do so I did a petty revenge prank. See the picture attached http://imgur.com/gallery/hdCnDfz .

In a social setting: when 2 people disagree with each other and have a mature conversation about it, it forces the individual who is listening to internally create an opinion on it.

The LUCY has definitely kicked in. I’m feeling almost shaky. From a micro dose? Holy shit.... I never thought it would still get me like this. Your body experiences many of the same physical feelings as when taking higher doses.

10:14am

If someone disagrees with you on something, an argument will break out. They will expect you to have REASONABLE examples to support your point. Especially if they feel strong opinions on the subject.

10:16am

On Lucy, I NATURALLY tend to prefer solitude over anything social, however at smaller doses like now it is a little fun to do some low key people watching and small social interactions.

10:17am

On a drug that is SUPPOSED to make you desire solitude, \[name\] desires to be around people... manipulative bitch. (long story dont ask)

10:19am

I am able to control my thoughts better at lower dosage. But at higher dosages you have to be able to LET YOURSELF GO.

My definition of Happiness: Love Life.

Every teenager doing drugs will either end up “falling off” {the Edge} OR they will make a realization that drugs are not necessary for a happy life. Which does not mean that doing them are a bad thing, just as long as they are used with maturity and proper timing.

12:30pm

My emotions are expanding further right now.

I can think. So well, in fact, that it is EXACTLY what is justifying my ability to expand my emotions while I am on this psychedelic.

12:50

Anytime someone makes a STATEMENT that I agree with, I am going to now; ask them to elaborate- much more often.

I now feel a fresh freedom to be able to express my emotions.

I feel so much love for others as well.

I don’t have to mention \[name\] anymore when I have thoughts that come to my mind.

Word\~

Honestly,

This trip has been bigger of a mindfuck than I thought it would be. 

But it was a beautiful, beautiful learning experience. I am still tripping. I will let myself continue to learn on my own without writing them out anymore, as the trip fades out.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve changed my ways. I’m a new man.

&amp;#x200B;

Every day that I wake up, I will be a new man, to tackle new things head-on. I am ready.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I have finally reached self-actualization. On a legitimate level.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is an extremely GENERAL statement.

You need things to be CLOSE to you, in order to understand how they work. 

As a kid, I never had it MY way. 

It doesn’t help that:

&amp;#x200B;

1. My parents were Mormon, and constantly wanted my attention, and wanted to FORCE Mormonism down my throat.

&amp;#x200B;

2. I never really got much alone time. Until I got my first car, a 1992 ford ranger. It enabled me to be insane, as in, I was very rebellious. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. I was so rebellious, in fact, that I smoked for all of the wrong reasons. But the primary issue is that I smoked to rebel. (I used to smoke until my lungs gave out but nowadays I’ve learned not to as much, for health purposes)

&amp;#x200B;

This is important. I just remembered this. As a CHILD, I watched TV quite a bit (subconsciously to avoid having to interact with anyone).

But the main point here is: I remember watching Burger King ads and being extremely intrigued by the slogan: “Have it Your Way”

&amp;#x200B;

Let that sink in.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s why I’m now a very DECISIVE and ASSERTIVE person. 

My trip has now just about ended, in a random place in Roseville, CA.

25012,I :love: Drugs,I haven’t been sober a day for almost two years and I’m okay with this.,"So just a little personal perspective.
I was diagnosed with IBS-C and Borderline prone to Chrons disease almost two years ago. It has made my life a physical hell. I went from 195 Pounds to 130 in a matter of weeks. I can no longer eat like the hulk and it has truly made every day so painful. If it wasn’t for my fiance and the fact that every time I go into a flare up and I’m in the bathroom she’s there with me 95% of the time, I would probably have killed myself a long time ago. Since my diagnosis I have been smoking weed everyday. As it helps as an anti inflammatory and kills the cramping. Weed is my savior. Psychedelics completely changed my life for the better and made me more of an empath and a lover, and I trip every two weeks to a month apart, preferably LSD,ALD52,ETHLAD,ALLAD, 4ACO tryps. I take gabapentin every three to five days. It helps take my mind off the bloating and helps me stay focused at work, i also take phenibut on other days, they are both nootropics and work well for coping with IBS/Chrons. kratom has also become a once a week thing for pain. I also love 6-APB(MDA/MDMA RC) but I only use that on special occasions every three to four months as it can be cardiotoxic and nuerotoxic if taken often. But the memo of this post is I can’t be sober, it hurts to much physically, the pain I feel on a daily is a nine out of ten on it’s best days. I do go to a gastroenterologist monthly and take care of myself and work and function in society like anyone else. I just thought I’d post this as it was in my head and wanted input. So when people say, oh sobriety once and a while is okay, for me it’s not okay and it never will be and I’ve already accepted that.",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aiapt0/i_havent_been_sober_a_day_for_almost_two_years/

25079,See Comments,Dealing with pupil dilation,"I’ve done some research on the topic myself but cannot decide what the best option would be to deal with dilated pupils from stims.

PST seems to be pretty unreliable as dosing cannot be accurate (no way of knowing the strength of the seeds bought). And if i did want to just get a feel for opiates i could make myself pure codeine which is more reliable.

Coloured contact lenses with my eye colour seem like a viable option, but seems like an option which would stick out as it wouldn’t be a completely natural way to deal with it (also flashing a light into the eyes would reveal that they are not reacting as normal).

DPH first of all doesn’t sound like a nice option and i’ve already tried that. From what i see i’ll need around 500mg (what i used to trip) to have an effect and constrict my pupils.

And if wondering sunglasses will not help in this scenario as I am talking about dealing with this during the night.

Any suggestions are welcome.

Hopefully this post can help other people who are wondering the same!

25132,Long Post,Trip Report: 1mg LSD and my first time with Lucy.,"I had procured some quality white on white LSD and wanted to experience all that it had to offer; on my first trip on acid, alone.

One square inch of this WOW held ~1680 ug of LSD (16x 105 ug .0625 sq inch tabs ). 

I measured and cut out 10 tabs carrying a full mg of acid, trimming a small slice off to taste test. 10x 105 ug tabs measured at the standard tab size of .0625 sq in, for .625 sq in total consumed) After tasting nothing but paper, I held the full 1mg of LSD down under my tongue for 10 minutes before swallowing the mush.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

t+20m: My lips and cheeks start to feel numb.

t+35m: I noticed my thoughts becoming much slower and the tingly numbness had spread to my toes and fingers so I went to the bathroom to take a dump before it kicked harder. 

t+50 min: I left the bathroom with my entire body aching. I laid down on my bed wondered what I had got myself into, and what it might be like at peak.

t+1h10m: My stomach, arms, and legs felt like I had eaten 1000 morning glory seeds raw. I tried to put on some grateful dead but I just ended up fumbling with my 5d touch screen that I couldn't even manage to locate with my fingers so I simply sat there staring at the album cover art to American Beauty for what seemed like an hour but was really 10 minutes.

t+1h20m: Laying down didn't help with the body load or limb pain so I left my bed to explore the living room, however the moment I left my bedroom I lost my train of thought so I sat down (not sure why) on the carpet in my hallway. My limbs felt as if my bone marrow had been replaced with molten lava. My stomach chiming in with a painful message that it was prepared to immediately expel anything I dare sneak in. A few minutes after leaving my room I walked back in and lie down on my bed.

t+1h25m: Laying down didn't help with the body load or limb pain so I left my bed to explore the living room, however the moment I left my bedroom I lost my train of thought so I sat down (not sure why) on the carpet in my hallway. My limbs felt as if my bone marrow had been replaced with molten lava. My stomach chiming in with a painful message that it was prepared to immediately expel anything I dare sneak in. A few minutes after leaving my room I walked back in and lie down on my bed.

t+1h30m: Laying down didn't help with the body load or limb pain so I left my bed to explore the living room, however the moment I left my bedroom I lost my train of thought so I sat down (not sure why) on the carpet in my hallway. My limbs felt as if my bone marrow had been replaced with molten lava. My stomach chiming in with a painful message that it was prepared to immediately expel anything I dare sneak in. A few minutes after leaving my room I walked back in and lie down on my bed.

This time loop repeated itself for about an hour. I just kept noticing something on my phone (which I could barely use but kept fiddling with) that made me want to exit my bedroom, then immediately losing my ability to think and sitting down in the hallway, then going back into my room after 5 minutes. Then after 6 minutes whatever it was triggered the loop again and I would get up and repeat the exact same steps, with the exact same outcome. After what I realized what I had been doing I managed to open a notepad on my phone and inform myself that I was in a time loop and to not sit in the hallway.

t+2h: By the time I broke out of the time loop the nausea had mostly passed. With my walls changing shape and shifting colors in front of my I knew I was going to be pretty fucked up soon so I took off my glasses so I did not damage them and put my phone away. Both huge mistakes. Turns out not being able to see for shit when you're tripping balls your first time isn't great, nor is not being able to locate your phone or glasses.
The inability to hold onto thoughts for more than a split second made it very difficult to think that I needed glasses, think where they are, then actually grab them and put them on. I didn't even meet the first requirement, at no point before the 10 hour mark did I even realize I wasn't wearing my glasses or contacts. My prescription is -5.5. 

t+2h11m: This is the latest I remember looking at the timer before I came back. I was lying spread eagle on my bed with gravity tugging my limbs in all directions, feeling an intense feeling of contentedness and euphoria set in for about 20 minutes.

t+2h30m: I was losing control and didn't know what was happening to me, well I knew, but all the knowledge in the world couldn't help with the fear. I was more scared than I have ever been in my life. I honestly believed that I was going insane. I believed I was dying and that was going to be my last day on earth. I just laid there naked, spread eagle on top of my sheets, thinking that's how they would find me. I accepted my fate. 

t+3h-5h: My memory here is limited but I do remember feeling so incredibly at peace and interconnected with every atom in the universe. I remember feeling like I was god. I felt how god might feel. To feel interconnected with every atom in existence. Omnipresent. 

t+6h: I felt reborn as I came back. I felt like a child seeing the world for the first time. Every object I looked at caused me to marvel at its mere existence.  Stepping out of bed I felt like a child on a weekend morning, with no responsibilities or worries. I remember giggling when I looked at my feet because I thought they looked like a babies feet, when mumbling about how I had baby feet for a long ass time.

t+7h: I took a shower and just enjoyed the incredible patterns everywhere. Everything was the most incredible thing you have ever seen. 10/10 shower curtain.


t+8h-14h: Sat in a chair contemplating the meaning of life.


The next day I felt like an entirely new person though, and much more connected and empathetic with humanity.



Ego death was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced but what came after was the most beautiful, and life changing. I regret nothing.

I took my first UA last Wednesday the 16th, prior to that day I smoked consistantly leading up to the test except for the 15th (the day before) where I worked out and did my usual hot tub / sauna routine. — That same night I went out with some friends and had a wild and incredibly stupid idea of smoking one final time, where I smoked on about one joint in total (two split between 4 people), the content was just under 25% THC for the pre-roll. I’ve abstained for the past 4-5 days and have worked out 2 of these days. As well as drank a decent amount of water but of course it doesn’t feel like enough. I’m 6’0, in my 20’s and just under 190lbs. I know I’m most likely not safe from this UA today but I need to know if there’s any possible way I can ensure my levels are below what I may have pissed on the 16th. Please help me Reddit. Google just gives me utter nonsense.

TL;DR — Active, 20s, under 200lbs. Smoked consistently for a week, couple bowls a day up until the 15th, took a UA on 16th, smoked a joint after UA at about 2am. Have worked out and been drinking water at regular rate since then and now have UA today the 21st in 8 hours. Need to know what I can do to reduce THC levels.

Edit — If I dilute my piss enough I can come up with a “diluted” UA and they’ll restart my program terms instead of giving me a “failed” UA for having higher levels of THC.

25257,Stimulants,Strange Reaction To 750 mg Armodafinil,"Okay so this will be my only post in this subreddit because i can not really share this experience with anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a college student who cycles armodafinil. I cycle it as one month on and one or two months off maybe more depending on my current situation at life. I usually take it around 150 - 450 mg. Past week i decided to take a considerably large dose because i felt experimental. I was really curious about if this drug has any recreational value at all when taken in large doses. So at around 9.30 am i popped 5 full pills at once and prayed not to die because of this. First few hours nothing has happened. Usually, around that time i start to get vibes from the drug but nothing happened which made me nervous like if i was already not. I took a shower and got ready for class. I managed to catch the public bus and this is when shit started to happen. I was listening to music while enjoying the beautiful scene of the city... Than i got curious about why am i enjoying it and boom! Here it was, a strong vibe from bottom to top of my body. My heart started to beat like i was doing cardio. As the feeling continued i had a strong urgency to do something which requires both mental and physical energy. I could not resist the feeling than i loudly said (because of earphones, i did not notice) ""Fuck yes!"" .  Few people stared me rest of the trip. Finally, i arrived to class but i was so excited, happy, motivated and full of life for no good reason. People could not understand what i was on but few mentioned that i look more energetic than i usually am.

During the class, while the professor was talking about a topic which is very open to discussion,i delivered a radical speech which was really offensive, that even drew more attention to me and than paranoia started. I have felt like everyone thought that i was on speed than i imagined people gossiping about me as a drug addict neo-nazi and several different scenarios which only took a few seconds to imagine but it was enough to make me anxious for the rest of the class. After the class, as effects of drug started to reach its peak, i noticed a huge increasement in my sexual desire. I naturally have a high desire for sex either i am deprived or not but this was something else. I literally wanted to fuck any girl i saw in several different positions right now where i saw her. I have managed the suppress sexual desire but could not handle the boner i got and started to head towards the bus station with a disturbing boner. While walking to the bus station, this strong urge to fuck someone has increased and that led me to think of visiting a prostitute even though i do not like prostitution but the idea of banging a prostitute skyrocketed my sex drive. I wanted to fuck a complete stranger and i had to do it immediately, so i messaged a friend of mine who visits prostitutes oftenly and asked the number of the girl he mentioned and described as ""hot as fuck"" . He gave the number, i called her and set up the meeting, headed to her place, fucked a prostitute with deep passion (imagine the dopamine rush i was having at the moment) than went back to dorm. As i have entered to room i screamed as ""woooah"" for no good reason because i was so damn high. Roommate asked if i have used anything, i said i have only used condoms in past few hours. I went to my laptop and started play chess and i was somewhat better than i normally am. This made me think that drug gave me an over-analytical mind which i can use for playing poker online and make some money. Yes, i gambled online with real money and managed to got a little amount of money out it. I didn't notice hours passed, my roommate asked if i was okay than offered me some beer and i accepted cause i really wanted to push limits. I drank 3 beers then went outside. As i was walking to god knows where ( i was both stimulated and drunk at this point) i noticed a truck passing slowly next to me and i impulsively yelled at the driver as ""You lucky motherfucker have a helluva truck."" He stopped the truck, got out and i was almost getting beaten by the truck driver but thanks to God he understood that i am drunk and didn't want to waste time on me. At this point, i was temporarily sobered up and decided to go back to the dorm and get some sleep. The drug sure has some qualities at higher doses but it does not worth it. I won't do the same thing again but if you ask me if i want to live the entire day again i would say  ""Fuck yes!"".

Tl;Dr : Tried high dose armodafinil, it put me in a manic state. During the mania, i banged a prostitute, appeared as a neo-nazi in class, played poker online and won a little amount of money and almost got beaten by i truck driver because i called him motherfucker.

25326,LSD,Acid Trip in Ecuador,"Im traveling solo through South America this winter and for the week of xmas/new years I purposely decided to stop in a beach town called Montanita in Ecuador. Some people call it the ""Ibiza of South America"". Drug dealers walk the beaches and will find you whatever you need. I spent 10 days there and managed to get my hands on a ton of blow, weed, acid and ecstasy. 

The acid trip is where thing got weird though. Few days prior i bought a pair of flip flops at this store in town and this 4""2 Ecuadorian chick who worked there was giving me this look that she wanted to fuck me right then and there. I took note of this but kept going on with my day. Later that day i go back there and ask her what time she finishes work, she says 10. So we go to her place at 10 and do the dirty business. It was fun. 

Now fast forward a couple days, i take 2 tabs of cid and it ends up taking 3-4 hours to kick in, i honestly thought i got ripped off. But when it kicked in, boy did it ever. This was my first time tripping on sand and it started feeling like I was walking on a huge sponge, the shapes in the sand were constantly changing, it was wonderful. I walked way past the touristy area to where the local fishermen parked their boats and layed on the sand in between 2 fishing boat, hidden from the general public. I layed on my back and looked at the clouds until eventually the stars came out, music playing through my headphones. When out of no where a raggedy ass street dog started licking my face and it freaked me the fuck out so i got up and started walking back towards the touristy area. As im walking i see this girl who stays at my hostel, and she was walking with her two friends straight towards me. She had never done or seen anyone on acid before. The look on her face when she saw my eyeballs was hilarious. ""ARE YOU OKAY?!"" she said. I explained my situation and she suggested i go see this Ecuadorian girl again. Great idea i thought. 

It was past 10 so i walked over to her little apartment (literally a bed on the floor and a fan on the ceiling and a toilet, thats it). I get to the front of her apartment, light up a smoke and bam she turns the corner and sees me, creepily waiting at the front door. I thought she would of been home already by now. Awkward. 
""What are you doing here?"" She says happy as shit. Then sees my eyes and she also asks if im okay. I dont say much, just go up to her place tear her clothes off and fuck her like an animal. Once i shoot my load, turn over and chill, this girl starts talking to me about love, coming to my country, and having a family. 

At this point I started feeling fucking terrible about what i had done. You can clearly tell that she really had her hopes up that i was going to change her life for good. 
Im leaving in a few days i kept telling her. ""WITH ME RIGHT?"" She would say. I felt like this had already gone too far and get up and try leaving and she stands in front of the door, holding the handle, telling me i couldn't leave. Im peaking at this point, worst time ever to be doing so but at the same time its kinda hilarious in a fucked up way. 

Shes dead set on holding this door and not letting me leave and i dont want to be the violent gringo so i turn around and open her back door. Its a balcony and i realized were on the fourth floor. I consider jumping and she starts yelling ""JUMP JUMP YOU CRAZY FUCKER JUMP"" in her funny accent. I start to giggle, but i know damn well ill break an ankle or a leg if i do. So i turn around and pick this girl up like an infant and put her on top of the bed, were at equal eye height now. She looks at me with this sad look and hugs me then says ""fuck me, fuck me, fuck me"" i look at her say ""id rather fuck my own mother at this point"" and finally walked out of there.

So I’m gonna start off by saying there is no need to give me shit about taking “the worst psychedelic on the planet”. I didn’t take very much only 350 mg. 

+0.00:I take the pills nervous as fuck because I’ve heard god awful stories about this shit .

+0.30:I’m kinda feeling lighter not the usual heaviness people said I was gonna experience. Also cotton mouth isn’t nearly as bad as I thought and throughout the night it never got bad. I’ve heard several bangs so far. 

+0.55: I watched my dog move but realized she’s not on my bed and she’s in her cage. Very small patterns in my walls and ceiling. 

+1.10: I can’t really move anymore although i still feel super light 

+1.30:I took a piss and when I looked in my shower there was a giant spider staring back at me. I reminded myself that I was tripping so I picked it up, or at least tried to, and kinda stared at it for a long time I ended up laying in my bed again forgetting how I got there so I assumed I teleported back. 

+2.00:I’m peaking incredibly hard and notice that my legs are breathing I go to scratch them and the breathing stops. I look over to my left and see what appears to be my best friend Alex. I haven’t seen him in almost a full year and so I freak out excited as fuck asking stuff like “hey man how’d you get here I missed you” and stuff like that but I hear the banging again and when I look for the sound I hear Alex poof away I look back and he is gone. 

+2.30: I stand up to grab something to drink and when I look at my cords attached to my tv they are moving around like a snake without its head. I start to laugh and I watch them for over 30 minutes because they wouldn’t stop. 

+3.00: I mist have fell asleep for a bit but I could’ve sworn I was awake. The visuals are insane now and I disassociate myself with being human (sounds weird because it’s such a low dose but I’m very light and am a light weight to anything)

+3.30:the spider has returned but this time I watched it crawl of the back of my phone to over the Camera. I shake it off and tell myself it’s not real. I hear a scream in my head and panic all little but again I just reminded myself I’m tripping. 

+4.00: the visuals are no longer as insane as they were before but are definitely there. This time I hear a guy in my closet telling me to wake up. 

+5.00: I’m settling down a lot and my vision is blurry and I lost the concept of time I completely forgot how to tell time or what it is. 

+6.00: as I feel sober again I have one last scare ready for me so as I open my sock drawer to hide my bottle i see eyes in the drawer. If you’ve ever taken DPH before you know how hyper realistic everything is. 

Nothing else really happened after that I slept for like 19 hours but other than that it was overall a good experience and plan to do it again. Thanks for listening and get high stay high brothers!

25406,Cannabis,"Terrifying psychedelic dab pen experience: a bad trip, nightmares,and a hangover.","This was a very traumatic experience, and 13 hours later I'm still foggy-headed and pretty upset. TL;DR at bottom.

Background: I have used acid many times, and smoked weed causally throughout high school. After taking acid for the first time in freshman year, I felt like weed was never the same for me. It always really fucked me up after just a joint or two

Fast forward to last night, a friend and I were planning to get baked, eat pizza, and spend a night in front of the TV. On account that my family was watching the supermoon this night, we did not start getting high until around 1:10 am. We went into my basement and each took about 14 hits from his dab pen. This was extremely stupid, especially seeing that I had not smoked for 2 months. 

Within a couple minutes, we both were pretty high. we sat on the couch and attempted to talk, which soon proved futile. Neither of us could finish a sentence. I felt like my body was coming apart, and within the first 15 minutes of the high i could not keep a train of thought or feel my body. My only coherent thought was ""what the fuck did I just do to myself?""

The high only got stronger, more psychedelic, and scarier. I felt like i was a mountain and that the covers above me were like trees and soil. I could no longer remember who I was or what I was doing. I could not move, and the room I was in looked very foreign to me. I would grow to hundreds of feet tall and touch the ceiling, and then become as small as an atom. Before my eyes, in the snapchat selfie camera my face transformed into a screeching baboon.  I felt absolutely terrified throughout the duration of this trip. I was having serious closed and open eye visuals and I felt like my mind was a TV, flitting between channels too quickly to process anything.  I managed to turn on the TV, but stupidly played this episode of black mirror. It was a deeply scary episode about this mom who implants this thing in her daughter and watches what she's seeing. I can barely remember or explain it, but its called arkangel. Look it up, it's horrifying. Anyways, after about an hour of this trip of pure fear and psychosis, I finally just gave up and laid down on the couch. Somewhere in the universes of closed eye visuals i was flying through I finally managed to drop off to sleep. I then entered a realm of terrifying nightmares, which i am still very shaken up about. It was a very traumatic night.

I woke up this morning around 7, and ate breakfast with my family. My speech and coordination were still very hindered, like I was still high. I spoke briefly with my friend, who had a similar experience to mine. We both agreed that it was a very fucked up night, and neither one of us would want to experience that again. I then crawled upstairs to my bed, and was in and out of sleep until 1 pm. I still feel very groggy and terrible, as well as anxious and stupid. This was an awful experience and has pretty much ruined weed for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I smoked way too much from a friend's dab pen, had a terrifying psychedelic trip, stronger than any acid I've taken. I completely lost my mind. A day later and I still can barely function. This has definitely ruined weed for me.

Has anybody else here experienced this level of insanity on weed too?  Is this an underlying mental problems thing, or did I simply just smoke way too much? And, this weed was not laced. I have smoked weed at the peak of an acid trip before, which I blame this experience on. ",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aifeeu/terrifying_psychedelic_dab_pen_experience_a_bad/

Though, last summer I had just had a new half sheet come in of some “200ug” LSD. I was excited and as soon as the weekend rolled by I dropped with a couple friends of mine. The come up was unusually smooth and relaxing, and as it was approaching peak I felt a huge body high, like very comfortable and peaceful. Although the weird thing was I wasn’t getting much visuals (still some visuals, but it didn’t equal to the body high if you know what i mean). 
So I definitely felt a 200ug body high, but about 100ug visuals or or less. 

The weird thing is my other two friends felt the exact same thing and they were also fairly experienced.

25814,Psychedelics,Have Drugs Made Me Self-conscious of My Voice?,"TL:DR at bottom 
Well, this post is probably a bad idea, but just know ahead of time that I'm looking for thoughts regarding the problem here, and not for attention... I'm still quite young, and definitely should not be using any mind altering substances but that's besides the point so let's move on. 

This all started a week before the Christmas break. I was cruising with two close friends and one friend who I'm chill with, so nothing too bad. I just didn't want to look like a goof which seems to always be impeding on getting high these days. Anyways, we we're in the car when my homie J called and I started talking with homie over the phone and whilst mid conversation with him, my one close friend T (female) said ""I, why TF are you talking like that ahaha I can't take you seriously"". 

Now I am an insecure person. Very insecure and anxiety is getting worse it seems. So this right away triggered extreme stress in my. My heart rate increased immediately and I got this very strong, heavy, feeling in my entire body. I managed to just completely ignore her and continue with the phone call, but inside it was killing me. This is what triggered the problem. Now, I believe it is important to note that I was slightly baked at the time, and previously, I had some thought/anxiety over the sound of my voice while high, but not like this. She said later in the car that ""I guess you're voice is just getting deeper"", but insecurity isnt that easy to get rid off, so the problem persists

Time passes and now I am paying attention to how my voice sounds a lot more often. Fast forward to the break. I'm at my homie M's house, and there's T, H ( was my other clos(est) friend in the car), M, D and B. Anyway we all take Molly to celebrate cuz tis the season, and everything is going great, except, I'm noticing the sound of my voice a LOT. It's sketching my out, and being the high dumbass I am, I begin mentioning it a lot before we even start rolling.

I'd keep asking each of them individually if my voice sounds weird, and each time they'd say what do you mean, as if I had just asked the dumbest, most insecure question to my closest friends (exactly what it was). Things only get worse on the Molly. While I can't remember the night too clearly, I remember two distinct moments of my trip pertaining to bad vibes regarding something I said, but I can't remember what it is I said and I know non of them except maybe T remember. 

But, I know what happened and got the just of the meaning behind what I said (if I didnt fabricate the memory from my mind) and it left me very scarred for the next two weeks, about my voice and other things insecurities.

Now, everytime I get high, it is a constant problem for me. And the worst part is, it's happens when I'm sober, all the time. It's fucking terrible and I don't know how to fix it, if maybe I've just reached a part of my life, and need to get past it. I'm hoping it's not something like mental illness and I would not jump to conclusions. I'm avoiding shrooms and Molly until further notice, and will try to solve the problem when I smoke again after exams. Maybe a little acid trip would help me face my insecurities. Thoughts?

TL:DR 
Insecurities regarding voice, friend brought it up, Molly trip made it 100x worse, and now I can't avoid it wherever I go. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aiipy2/have_drugs_made_me_selfconscious_of_my_voice/

25897,Cannabis,"I know you guys won't believe me on this one, but a lot of weed gave me strong psychedelic effects","Me and my friends decided to smoke some weed. Well for some reason i decided I wanted to experience death that night, so I smoked an incredibly large quantity of very potent weed. The events that transpired next probably looked like what can only be described as an exorcism to my friends. I mean, it was really bad. First I'll tell from there perspective, than I'll tell what was happening in my head:

They saw me get up, walk around in circles for a while while yelling ""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD"" while trying very hard to get me to quiet the fuck down because we were in an illegal state and we're smoking in the middle of the woods. I then proceeded to fall to the ground, try to get up and freeze in a position on all fours yelling ""IM LIKE A MAGNET GUYS"", I then roll over and lay on my back looking at the sky and yelling ""OH GOD OH FUCK THIS IS A DREAM IM DREAMING HELP ME"". My friends believe that I faked this whole thing and that I did it for attention.

But here's my perspective:
My friend tells me she loves to get up when high cause it feels weird, I proceed to do this. I notice I feel very heavy. I start walking and I notice something super weird, which is that I can feel my muscle memory operating, like I can tell that I'm not *really* micromanaging my legs in order to walk and that it's happening automatically. I found this crazy, and apparently during this episode I had no way of controlling whether or not to actually vocalize my thoughts... Then I feel incredibly heavy and fall to the ground, I feel like my whole body is being magnetized to the earth... This is where the ""hallucinations"" begin to kick in. I notice that my vision looks sort of dome-shaped, then sound starts to be suuuuuuper weird. It kept repeating the same second over and over and getting sort of fuzzy and blurred together and echoey (I had much more experience with this when I was later in a crowded McDonald's with music). Then something insane happens, after staring at the same place for a while, it feels like my state of consciousness suddenly changes and everything looks/feels like a dream and like nothing is real, I now roll over and look up at the sky and it's super weird. It looks sort of normal, but there's this silhouette of some trees and it looks incredibly 2D and sort of like another layer of the sky. My vision looks very curved inwards and sort of likes it's flowing outward.

So yeah. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? Is it at all possible that this weed was laced with something? My friends smoked, just not as much, and definitely didn't have these effects.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aij8ek/i_know_you_guys_wont_believe_me_on_this_one_but_a/

26008,Psychedelics,Bandersnatch ruined my friend's first LSD trip.,"Last night me, my girlfriend, and four other friends decided to trip.
For two of my friends this was their first time taking LSD.
Me&amp;My girlfriend had dosed 220ug roughly, the newcomers had dosed 110ug roughly.

Everything went well until i decided to smoke some marijuana with my girlfriend to bring the visuals back a bit (6-8 hours from ingestion had already passed).
The two first timers decided to have a few tokes of that joint we just rolled with us, initially i didn't see any problem with that.
After smoking this girl  jumps on the table and starts screaming ""this can't be happening"".

She was unresponsive and panicked, i grabbed her hugging her and asked my friends to go grab a Xanax from my drawer.
This girl then squeezed my hand and kinda just came back to reality, asking me ""What did i do?"", looking extremely scared and confused.
We explained what she did calmly and she proceeded to explain how the movie Bandersnatch that she saw a week or two ago was in the back of her head the whole time.
She thought  that by taking acid she would die now, as this was one of the possible endings as in the movie.

TL;DR: First timer takes acid and mixes it with marijuana, she believes delusions about the movie Bandersnatch being the truth of life, panicking to the point where she needs to be held with ""force"".

26061,Cannabis,Weed with mugwort,"Hi, i'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but yesterday i found out something interesting.

I've read this thread about a year ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/5a5ho6/smoked_mugwort_and_weed_from_the_same_bowl/

So i had collected mugwort from the forest because ive read that it might enhance your high when on weed. In the past half year or so i used it when smoking and it is really somewhat different but wasnt a big deal until now. It was maybe 2x the effects or something like that.

Basically what i was doing wrong is that i never mixed them well, just stacked them over each other in the bowl. This time i mixed them thoroughly in my grinder and smoked 2 bowls. Just as much weed as i would normally smoke but filled the rest of the bowl with Mugwort. Twice.

After this i layed down in my room, lights off and was searching for music on my phone. After i selected a song i was staring at the tracklist and lowered my eyelids to a point where it started looking blurry then i had the most amazing trip of my life. My vision has started morphing into weird patterns and stuff then my eyelids closed then i had a lot of images just appearing in sync with the music. It lasted for around 1.5 hour but i could stop the trip anytime if i opened my eyes, then i could also go back with the same technique. I just lol'd all the way along and sometimes i could see whatever i thought of. It was like in those lsd videos on youtube. Haven't been told any great secret of the universe or anything like that and i didnt really have any deep thoughts, it was just simply really fun. I felt really really intense euphoria and woke up very refreshed in the morning.

I've never had any closed eye visuals on weed and the herb, so i think the most important here is the technique, and it might work with other psychedelics too. You have to stare at something with your eyelids lowered halfways and then your brain starts ""correcting"" your vision and then you find yourself traveling. It might have something to do with dreams, since mugwort is said to enhance one's dreams.

26079,Psychedelics,Should I try psychedelics?,"So let me give some history. 

I used to smoke weed a lot, but after several experiences involving panic attacks, paranoia, and general anxiety, I stopped. I pretty much can't smoke weed anymore because my heartbeat goes up to nearly 130-140. I almost had a stimulant induced heart attack (medically examined) a few years ago, so fearing having another makes it worse. 

I have always wanted to try psychs, especially DMT due to its short lasting effects. I know that's backwards, and I may be TOTALLY wrong (correct me if I am), but I'd rather be scared shitless for 15 mins, than have a bad trip for 6 hours + on acid/shrooms. 

Anyways, I really think that everything about psychs seem awesome. Visuals, bright colors, feeling one with everyone and the world, changed perspective, etc. I want to experience those things so badly, but I'm genuinely worried that based on my history I'll have a bad time. 

Is taking Xanax before acid/shrooms recommended? Would that help? Would acid/shrooms be bad for me if I get anxious even with weed? 
I read about people getting HPPD. If I got that I don't know how I'd cope. I got pretty severe depersonalization for nearly a year when I was younger and could barely stand that. I just don't know if there's any negative mental changes I'd get after. 

Essentially my biggest worries are-

1. I'll freak myself out and panic the entire time because I'm scared. 

2. I'll kinda lose my mind after taking it. Not like going full blown crazy, but even just a weed panic attack gave me intense, year long depersonalization. So what would acid do to me? Is it even worth the risk?

It doesn’t control my trip at all anymore unless I take crazy doses. I’m the one driving that bus and the bus could be a manual, I’d still be ok. I’ve taken shrooms while tripping on acid about two hours into a trip I took 3.5g of shrooms. That was fun. But I have not taken them by themselves before. I’m a college student with two kinda BS classes when I get up in a few hrs (been up all night doing research for a business I’m starting) my questions are as follows: for a well-experienced LSD user, (I’ve taken DMT as well) how controllable are shrooms around people? Do they keep you awake like LSD does? Or do they make you feel sleepy at the end of the 6 hour trip? (I have adderall if I needed to JUST be awake, but I’ve wanted to dose shrooms and be around people and out in the world to give me a new perspective on what I consider a pointless daily grind). 

Is an eighth a bad starting point for shrooms? Like, I’ve taken it while on acid but I had a psychos tolerance at the time and had been fucked up all week on a mix of weed alcohol acid and hash (which is weed but for those of you who use it you know there’s a bit of a difference in how it hits you). I’ve done dumber things for the sake of a good story later. I don’t have tests or quizzes, and I’m not going to be required to speak to anyone during this time. I’m just going to be learning a bit about Africa and then listening to a professor talk about public speaking. And I will be riding a bus for transport. 

For an experienced psychs user, (I’ve gone to school tripping on LSD on a day we didn’t have much going on, found it to be a great day for drawing and it made classes feel like the info I was learning was world changing and actually important) would it really be so bad to trip? Or am I basically asking to have an accidental nightmare i have to sit calmly through (which I’ve also done, to an extent. Psychedelics out of the home tend to get a lil weird but at least this time I won’t be talking to my mom face to face while out “drinking” with a group of friends cause I happen to run into her...THAT was terrifying). Anyone done it? Like, gone to classes high on shrooms? Any tips for prep?

I Alwyas have been. I am also in the military, which further cements my ability to keep my cool under pressure or when shit is going down. Even when some absolute crazy shit went down once while we were all tripping, I remained calm. 

So anyway, I really respect lsd. I feel if you don’t respect lsd, it will fuck you. It will bend your reality and really have its way with you. I usually do lsd at festivals, so I keep my dosage pretty low since I’ll be taking it more than one day, for tolerance reasons. So the largest dose I’ve likely done is between 2-3 tabs, depending on strength of the tab and size. 

I just don’t understand how I see posts saying they took 16 tabs for their first time, 16 tabs is a fuck ton in general, but for your first time? My first time I did a candy flip with half a tab and I was launched into another dimension. I saw something that wasn’t there, and everything, living or non-living, had a personality. It was absolutely insane. 

People who take 10+ tabs, how do you do it? I’ve tripped on some really strong tabs once and forgot who my girlfriend was, on 10 I’d lose grasp of existence entirely. 

Does the dosage blend in after awhile? For example are there big leaps? From 1 to 2 or from like 2 to 6?

During those 2-3 seconds while you're drinking it... while you're gulping that goddamn water like a dying animal, nothing else matters in this life. It's only you and that glass of water, you love it and it loves you back in perfect harmony.

People say you get religious experiences while on DMT? Fuck them. They never had a good glass of water in their life. That shit will satisfy the ""inner beast"" you didn't know you had, and warm your heart like a thousand blankets on a cozy christmas night.

I have recently found how much taking LSD is at raves. My question is are there any supplements I can get to make me less exhausted the next day or two after? I went to one last week, dropped 250ug and was stuck in bed for a good day or two after, so any guide in the right direction is much appreciated.

26202,Long Post,"Probably the 2 worst nightmare psychosis stories you've read, and I caused them both","I dont know where to start, I just need to get this off of my chest. Feel free to judge me because I'm extremely irresponsible for putting the ones i love the most in danger.

I'm 24, have been dealing with anxiety, depression, and addiction for years. I feel like its eaten away at me and has left me empty, always craving anything other than being sober. I was introduced to psychedelics at 21 and became obsessed. Being able to get out of my own head, feeling free, reborn, you know what it's like. Incredible. But instead of applying what I learned and seeking help for my problems I always ended up back in my old patterns. And every time I took more psychs I would see how much of an addicted mess I was and would SWEAR I would change this time. Never happened.

I still live at home with my parents and younger siblings. They love me, and are the only real thing in my life. They are my life in a way. I'm like a second dad to the three youngest, they are always more excited to spend time with me than anyone else because I actually listen to them and spend as much time as I can to make them happy. Life just wouldn't be the same without them.

I'd done lsd and mushrooms at least a dozen times in nature or at home, and only had amazing (although difficult at times) experiences. I also smoked weed almost daily for 2 years and realized it heightened my anxious and paranoid thoughts but I couldn't stop, even though I knew it wasnt good for me. 

A year and a half ago I was in a very depressed and self destructive state. I couldn't stand being me so I wasnt thinking clearly. It was late at night and i took probably 5 giant dabs, and for some reason my high mind thought it would be a good idea to take 60mg of 4-aco-dmt (synthetic shrooms). The most I had taken before was 40mg and I'd never combined weed with any psychs before. My selfish depressed mind never once considered this could possibly be a terrible idea, since I handled everything else in my past experiences. I was very wrong. 

I was laying in my bed and something felt very wrong, but I didnt know what it was or how to deal with it. I started to panic and needed to ground myself. Anxiety through the roof. I hopped in the ice cold shower and it helped, in fact I suddenly had a deluded sense of 'clarity' and felt I needed to talk to my parents about some type of revelation I was having. What I forgot was that my dad wasnt home and it was just my mom and siblings.

When I got upstairs, my state changed. I started losing my shit completely. I was in a completely different insane reality, but at the time it all made sense. Felt like I was experiencing the 'real' reality and was finally seeing behind the curtains. I experienced basically all the symptoms of psychosis, I was interpreting everything in a personal way, hearing and seeing shit, and worst of all the thought loops. Literally felt like the same events were repeating over and over again. Literally felt like I was stuck in time and the only way out was pain..sounds crazy because it was. I've never been a violent or suicidal person, ever. But in this insane and terrifying state, it was the ONLY solution, like it's what I felt deeply, I had to do it. I was fucking running headfirst into doors. Stabbed the kitchen counter with a fork and it bent in half. Smashed a mirror to bits. My blood everywhere. I even remember having the thought of seppuku, and there's no doubt if I had a knife I would have stabbed myself straight into my stomach. I was also stark naked this entire time. All while my poor mother was there, trying desperately to calm me down. The younger kids locked in the bathroom with my 15 year old sister watching them, crying, hearing all this. I accidentally gave my mother a black eye at some point, by bumping my head into her. While it was happening my mom called my dad, panicked and over her head, saying I'm having a breakdown and there's blood everywhere, then hanging up to call 911. For 15 minutes my dad didnt know what was going on, and had to drive 2 hours back home. I was naked, covered in blood, laying in the grass outside when the police and ambulance showed up. Luckily I didnt resist, and at that point what was going through my head was ""we've all been here, being the crazy psychotic person was part of the whole show, these cops are all me and they know it but the act must go on."" The ride to the hospital felt like eternity, and one of the paramedics told me I had attacked my mom with a fork (which I didnt) so in my delusioned mind I thought that I either hurt or killed her. Words can't describe how I felt for the hour before learning she was fine. 

You'd think that after experiencing that, and affecting my family like that, I would have changed and taken action immediately. I talked to my parents about it of course, but this is the strange thing about my family and myself. We just dont talk about real shit that goes on in our lives. We all act like everything is ok and go about our daily business, until something really isn't ok and its addressed..briefly. After talking to them and promising to abstain from all drugs, we never talked about it again. And I never saw a therapist, and convinced myself it was a one time thing and that I was overall fine - just a bad mix of mind altering drugs. Of course my addicted mind eventually made it's way back to drugs, feeling like it's the only escape from my hopeless life. I was much more careful, that is until 3 weeks ago. 

I took 3 hits of acid and 170mg of molly in my room by myself. I had a great time, and actually felt confidence and empowerment about myself for the first time in ages. I felt like I had broken out of my personal hell, and felt alive. 4 hours into it I was watching a deep sea documentary, and the high was dying down. I was returning to my sober self so for some reason I thought that meant it would be fine to smoke some weed. Smoked from my pen (40 percent Cbd which is another reason I thought it would be safe, I'm unbelievable) and suddenly I entered the psychosis state again. It was like the documentary I was watching suddenly was speaking directly to me and had nothing to do with the fucking fish. Like it was sending me obvious hints that I NEEDED to listen to, they were powerful and important messages..

And in my mind it felt like I was aware of all parallel realities in a way, like a giant wheel, and if I relaxed my body and stretched my neck back I would 'slip' into a larger awareness or something. Very hard to explain because it's fucking nuts but it felt so real at the time. But then it felt like I was going to slip into something terrible if I didnt stay still or something, or I would break reality. My mind was freaking out but I knew I needed to keep my cool no matter what happened. Then I dont really remember the transition, but suddenly I felt an extremely powerful urge that something was wrong and was about to happen, but I didnt know what. 

I've had several amazing and grounding dmt experiences over the past 6 months, and it literally felt like those same beings were speaking to me and warning me that someone in my family was about to die and I had to stop it. The feeling kept growing and growing until I believed it with every ounce of my being. Like these beings could see the future and I HAD to help whoever was about to be in trouble. Filled with adrenaline I sprinted to the nearest two rooms, yelling ""ARE YOU OK"" to my two teenage sisters before booking it upstairs. The last thing I remember is seeing a figure in the dimly lit kitchen. For a split second I thought it was an intruder about to kill my family, but then I thought ""what if its actually a family member"" so I surrendered and collapsed on the ground. The next thing I know, I wake up with my mom kneeling next to me with her face fucking covered in blood (there was no blood at all but I imagined it). Since I basically blacked out, and saw undeniable blood on her face, my mind went to the worst possible scenario and I fucking believed it. I thought that I killed my 2 year old brother. The light of pure innocence and joy, the one who always looks up to me, always wanting to be with me and play with me. It's so hard to type this, it was the worst nightmare I could possibly ever imagine. I kept asking my mom, ""who did I kill"" (when you see blood clear as day from an unknown source it appeared to me to be the only explanation- I would never ever hurt anyone) and she would say that I didn't hurt or kill anyone. In my mind she was saying this because she couldn't bear to tell me what happened, because it was too god awful to say. Again, words can't explain how I was feeling at the time- but I'm sure you can imagine. I then felt that there was a hole in my chest and that I was bleeding out- I was dying and death couldn't come quick enough. I felt like I only had seconds left to live, and I just HAD to know for sure who I killed before I faded away forever. So I kept painfully asking, not wanting to hear the answer, but knowing I needed to know. I kept getting the same answer, and eventually I accepted that she wouldn't tell me. I kept telling her that I'm so sorry, I blacked out, I dont know what happened, that type of thing. And she was comforting me even though I knew I didn't even deserve it, I was a fucking monster. This whole time I had been pressing my hand against my chest to stop the percieved bleeding so that I could spend my final moments getting out what I felt I needed to say. But when I thought I saw lights from the ambulance coming I took my hand off and I felt my blood pumping out and oozing onto me, knowing I could never in a million years live with myself. I accepted death and I looked at my hand and saw it literally dissolving into dust. Felt like the beings were there to take me away and I was accepting it. I kept telling my mom that I was about to die and that I was so sorry. Due to the loops this was all happening over and over again, but it would be slightly different. Or at one point it felt like I went back in time and I was on the couch suddenly talking to my mom, with my 2 year old brother, and she was acting like nothing was wrong. It felt like the universe was allowing me to have my final moments with those that I love, and then I saw my hand fading away and I knew what was going to happen in the future but I could do nothing to stop it since time isn't linear and I knew what was coming. 

This is the hardest thing to explain, but it felt like these 'other dimensional beings' that I could feel were fixing my terrible mistake as long as I did everything right. It felt like they were allowing me to enter an alternate timeline where nothing terrible happened. And to do that I couldn't indicate that anything was wrong and had to just go with what was happening. Like my mom said something, which could be taken as serious or a joke, and I had to play it off as a joke or she would know something was wrong. It's all fucking crazy believe me I know. Slowly I looked at my chest and saw no blood, saw no blood on her face, and I just couldn't believe it. Felt like I was being saved by a higher power. The kids all came out and they were perfectly fine, never even got woken up by the ordeal. Never been more relieved in my life.

Of course what really happened was that my internal fears were projecting itself into my reality, and my mom simply found me laying on the kitchen floor, thinking I did the worst thing imaginable. But fuck me did it feel so real. 

I just had to get all this off my chest. I can only imagine that anyone reading this will think I'm fucking crazy and a danger to others and I dont blame you. I have to live with myself the rest of my life and it won't be easy. know I need to get my shit sorted out asap because I can't stand being alone, thinking about everything I've done and put my family through.

26272,LSD,I had 200ug of acid 20 min ago and have written this since,"Nights spent in cigarette smoke and melancholic stupor. Turn up the sound, silence the thoughts. Days spent in anguish pretending to be some one else. Hate, bitterness. It envelops you, hides the world from you. The look they give you. Fear, loathing, scorn. But first fear, of course. 

Cascade of grey idle days. Some better. Some worse. But all meaningless. Dull, lobotomised by anxiety and fear. A spike of hope. A relief of a joint and warmth of scotch. Exilirating rush of lust in the room sinking in dim red light. A red note, and a grin on her red lips. Stream of chemicals into the dry like a nuclear dessert brain. Back on the street. Cigarete after cigarette. Suck in every bit of it. Before it crystallises into just another soul scorching bitter memory. 

Insanity. The last oasis for the life beaten consionsness. Last one after the drugs turn on you. Mind scorched with their flames without even seeing the promised light. Where is the advertised youth. Where is the high of love - The fucking heart is nothing but scar tissue. Where is the call of the brave new world. Where am I. Only a reflection, a pale shadow left. Where are smiles, where is the laugh. Nothing but masks all around.

Have another one from the pack. Soothing bitterness and the world seems pretty again. No need to write, no pleasure in fighting the burning white of the empty paper.

It never stops. They said you gotta fight it. Unless it’s a trip. But what if the whole life turns into a trip. Twisted, colourless, idle journey. Depression ties your hands and lets life do the rest of the dirty job. You jerk up. Your head clears for a moment. The faulty part of your brain, the twist thats been cutting the supply of the sweet sweet dopamine, unwinds. Enjoy it, take a breath. But don’t get used to it. Few days and its back in to the void. Dive in head first. 

An outcast among outcasts. Hide and seek with reality. From books, to stupefying world of gaming, to drugs and intoxicating violence. A new born rogue. They talk about you. Smoking Marlboro young girls in rolled up skirts want to know you. You start playing along. Soon you can’t escape it.

Mind goes blank. Are you going crazy or descending into the void of mediocricy. Hopefully the first one. You get tired of fighting, Wandering through life punch drunk. Fate striken. Pride burns inside you. All is dead but pride. Pride for somebody you once were. Or think you were.

Few months left till exams. No more liquor to sink in. No more bridges left to burn. No more fuel.

The great experiment starts now. How long more can I take this. How log can I endure this pathetic caricature of a life. How long can i keep the screaming voice inside quite. Go all the way. All the way. All the way till the bugs start crawling out of your eyeballs, the walls start bleeding and shadows whispering your name. Day and night. Rape your brain. No way back. Only a few steps till the cliff back there. 

IT starts Now. Go all the way, all the way till you loose it. Even if you don’t have anything left to loose…",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aio31j/i_had_200ug_of_acid_20_min_ago_and_have_written/

At about 1 hour in it started to hit, so I just laid in my bed and listened to Infected Mushroom while it took hold. I then made contact with an entity, that's all I could call him. He requested I use he/him pronouns, even though technically he was genderless. Some may call him a deity, but he said that was misrepresentative because he isn't as powerful as any deity currently believed in by people.


He is more powerful than any human though, and said that if he wanted he could make an earthly form and provide for a lot of people, whatever he meant by that. 


He isn't all knowing, but his knowledge base was far larger than mine, and he was willing to share it if I helped him. He wanted to know the purpose of mankind, and so I let him see through my eyes and live the rest of my life with me. It isn't like being possessed because he has no control over me, he is only bearing witness. 


In exchange, he would show me his world, first with his knowledge being shared with me right now. Then, after I have died and he experienced my full life he would take my spirit and bring me to his plane of existence.


Overall a good experience, and I think I'll try DMT sometime because I've heard it's pretty spiritual and maybe I can meet the entity for longer.

26300,LSD,The different kinds of acid,"So anyone who's taken acid for long enough to be able to try tabs that feel entirely different from one another know what I'm talking about.

There are also super visual acids that don't seem to mess with your head and thoughts as much, but can easily blanket your FOV with visuals.

What are your guy's experiences with different tabs? Have you ever had a body feel tab or visual acid? What was yours like?

I'm not an optiod user so I feel like I could tell if this was fentanly instead of alprazolam?  How similar are the two chemicals?  Wouldn't you be feeling all warm n cozy and nodding out on fentanyl?

I mean this stuff taste like alprazolam and feels like alprazolam, but just that devil in the back of my mind thinks it could be something else.  

I feel like it could more likely be etizolam or clam as they are more accessible.  I feel like you'd have to know some people to get liquid Xanax, but you can order liquid etizolam and clam online clear net.

26410,Long Trip Report,My first ever trip and my only actual *trip*,"Mushrooms are one hell of a drug, and my first ever experience with them was an experience so incredibly beautiful, terrifying, and intense, that it is something I question whether or not I ever want to revisit. It was a trip laden with my own errors, and due to my own lack of research, it was an experience I went into flying most entirely blind. I want to be clear, flying blind was 100% a mistake, but that mistake flew me straight into an experience that is one of the closest I've been in my life to true adventure.

To begin, this mushroom trip was my first psychedelic experience ever. It was far from the last as I've dropped acid several times since this experience, but it was by far the most intense trip of my life and to date, the only mushroom trip I have ever had. 

I was a senior in high school, and psychs were always something I had a desire to dabble in. I remember it was one of those gray winter days oh so common in my own northern corner of the Midwest, and funnily enough it was the day of a high school dance (for the life of me I cannot remember which one, but it wasn't prom.) It was a Friday night, and I left the dance with this girl I knew to pick up my friend and go to her apartment which was unoccupied at the time. I knew we were going to trip, I was hyped for it, we had planned this night out only a few days in advanced, but we had been talking about tripping for months.

We get to this girls apartment, clock is striking around 10 at night and he busts out the mushrooms. Funny little things mushrooms are, a sickly gray-tan color, entirely dehydrated. They looked more like something I would eat on trail rather than something that would send my mind through the fucking wormhole of insanity. We chowed down on them, each of us eating an entire eighth, with him giving me the bigger of the two bags so I realistically probably had a little more than an eighth.

That was the cardinal sin, the main error that I committed. I did no research, I did not know an eighth was as much as it was and I certainly didn't know that beginners were not supposed to take that much. I trusted this friend completely (still do, he is a childhood friend and still one of my best), but due to this blind trust I just assumed that he would know the perfect amount to give my beginner ass. He had tripped before, several times, an eighth was the perfect level of intense for him, he had no idea how thoroughly and completely that amount of mushrooms could obliterate the mind of a man who had never tripped in his life.

I always did well with drugs, I had been incredibly stoned before and to this day I have never had a bad reaction to weed, so I assumed it would all work out as I hoped. I ate the mushrooms (with a little help of some m&amp;ms to drown at the taste) and that day, my life changed forever.

For awhile not much happened, I resisted the temptation to smoke weed in the interim in order to preserve full experience of the mushrooms. I am and have always been a curious and scientifically minded person, to me this was an experiment, a test to see first hand the effects of a psychedelic, and I did not want to mess up the purity of my experiment by adding in weed before I could even feel the mushroom high. And so, I waited.

By around T+ 30 minutes from ingestion, I began to feel a bit... odd. I felt almost giddy, the sort of sickly excitement you get right before something terrifying happens. I remember it felt like being at the precipice of a roller coaster looking out at the drop ahead knowing that there was no way off this ride short of waiting it out. My heart started to beat faster, my head started to swim a little, I began to feel almost drunk. My friend kept telling me it was placebo because it was too early to be feeling the effects, but I knew, I knew that this was not placebo, I could feel it coming on. I ran to the bathroom.

Looking in the mirror I began to start to see the visuals, and that is when I knew for certain it was beginning. It also began to set in then how woefully underprepared I was. I already knew that it was going to get many more times intense than it was at that moment, and already my heart was racing, my head was getting muddled and I could feel my world start to slip away. There was nothing left to do now but ride it out. No path but forward, the way out had long since passed. Composing myself and saying to myself ""I must not fear, for fear is the mind killer"" I stepped back out into the living area with a new found sense of excitement and anticipation. I knew this was going to be a wild ride, but how could I turn down a trek into entirely uncharted waters. For better or for worse, this was going to be my own personal adventure.

My sense of timing was beginning to slip. I could not (and still can't) remember how long it had been since application. My friend was grinning a little bit, and my world was beginning to quiver, I was seeing it on the walls, the strange movement, the psychedelic shimmer, almost like weird little worms making their way below the surface of the wallpaper. I that anticipatory anxiety nearly completely taking over my mind. I stood up head spinning and made my way to the bathroom. I do not know what compelled me to look in the mirror, but the mirror began my trip. I could see my face distorted with shadow, I could see those same psychadelic worms making their way under my own skin. My face became angular, almost tribal, and everything was looking just unfamiliar. My own face was a weird sort of sinister reflection, and something I barely recognized as me. I stepped back out into the hall with my head still spinning and hazy to make my way back to the couch. It was then, right in that hall, that my mind exploded.

One thing I've heard a lot in regards to psychs like acid or mushrooms is that the hallucinations do not feel real, not like a dissociative in any case. I have also heard that they are not like complete, your entire vision doesn't change, just what already real objects look like. I do relate to that for acid, but this mushroom trip, as unbelievable as it seems, was a trip defined by complete and entire hallucinations during the peak. It is all a blur to me but I will try and recount what all I experienced. 

In that hall my mind exploded. How do I even begin to describe it? It was a single moment where I went from kind of tripping, to absolutely gone. It felt like being shot in the head, I felt like my life ended right there right then in that hall, and I was making that final trip during death. Funnily enough I do remember this moment. The vertigo struck fiercely and I collapsed to my knees and slumped over laying down in the hall. It was all I could do, control of my body was simply gone. I actually have a picture of me laying in that hall in my pajamas and I still laugh about it. 

My world was changed, the white walls had morphed and stretched, the world turned a sort of faded royal blue and I was falling amongst spires. Falling, falling, falling, that was all I felt. The vertigo was in my head and I was laying on the floor which I am sure was the cause of the feeling, but I was still falling. The best description I have of this strange spired freefall was like falling into the cover of the Dr. Seuss book ""Oh the Places You'll go,"" except the weird spire was blue instead of what it is on the cover. The spires faded away to open air and I fell into the album cover of currents. I could feel the lines of blue washing over me like some sort of divine hug, it was an oddly beautiful sensation.

The rest of my time in the hall is all a blur of manic laughing and brief respites of sanity where I re-remembered that this was all a drug. I don't know for certain how long I was in that hall, maybe an hour? Less? More? I'm not sure. I do remember during those moments of sanity I realized I was on the floor and not particularly comfortable. I regained my faculties enough to shuffle on my knees to the living space and plop myself down on the couch. With the comfort of sitting down on something soft the feeling of discomfort vanished, and that feeling proved to be my last real tether to the world. On that couch, I died. 

I am not sure if this was true ego death, but it certainly felt like it is described. My identity was gone, my sense of self erased. My sense of others, my sense of being, was all gone. I was a lone consciousness lost in the confines of my own head. My body didn't feel right, I couldn't seem to control it properly. My nose felt wrong, my ear felt as if it was in the wrong place, my own nerves and sensations betrayed me as I floated through the empty space of my own mind. I could still feel things, but the things just felt incorrect, like my nervous system was disconnecting from my brain. 

It really was a peculiar feeling, and an oddly calm and quiet moment that stretched on for eternity. I was not scared, I simply existed, an observer to this strange and foreign world that was my reality a mere couple hours ago. I knew the facts. I knew my name, Jack. Easy. But what is Jack? Who am I, who are these people I am with. I could list out my likes and dislikes, my occupation, my dreams, but it was just a list. It was like reading my own dossier but through the eyes of a stranger. I had similar knowledge about the people I was with, I could list the facts but there was no identity associated with that knowledge, no emotional connection to them at all. They were just a stranger in the body of a person I once called my best friend.

I remember from this haze the concept of time was entirely discontinued as well. I had plans the next day. But what was the next day? And for that matter, what was the previous day. ""What is Thursday?"" I said to myself out loud, something that was repeated endlessly as a funny drug story in the weeks and months to come. Time just didn't make sense, this moment was eternity to me, all there was and all there ever will be just existed to me at that moment. It was divinely peaceful, no future to consider, no past to worry about. Just my consciousness observing this particular moment in silent contemplation.

I also remember being particularly fascinated with math, I was doing trigonometry stuff in class that week for precalc and I was struck by the beauty of mathematical patterns. I wanted to work on math work, I wanted to learn about it. It was something so simple and yet so complicated. Manipulating numerical patterns to solve real world problems, incredible!

The ego death was bliss, but right after it became hellish. My identity rushed back into me like a torrent and I lay their on the couch finally starting to be aware of how fucked up I was. ""Holy shit, I am going to die!"" The thought popped into my head like an earworm, and it was a thought I couldn't shake. My friend asked if I was alright but being the fiercely independent individual that I am I replied that yes I was, I didn't want to ruin the trip for him. But there I sat, the bliss fading away to terror as I felt myself being dragged down into a bad trip.

That is one of the other peculiar things about mushrooms, I always felt like I was on the edge of a bad trip. Even when things were going amazingly, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was one bad moment away from hell. I have never had that feeling on acid.

I laid on the couch contemplating what was happening. I was going to die of a drug overdose on a shitty winter night in an apartment of a person I did not know well. God dammit, that is a shitty way to go, my parents are going to be so disappointed. The experience was overwhelming, the visual and mental torrent of the mushrooms exacerbated the feeling that I was going to die. In some twisted way I began to yearn for the release of the void, the mental stimulus was beginning to become too much for my little old brain to handle.

Then as suddenly as it began I was struck with the realization of how god damn ridiculous this line of thinking was. I was sitting there thinking that ""damn, I am going to be the first recorded mushroom overdose"" then it occurred to me that I hadn't even taken a ridiculous amount. I began to laugh to myself, the manic thoughts of death fled from my mind as I realized that I was going to be fine, it is just some mushrooms. 

From then on the trip was pleasant albeit blurry. I do remember some specific hallucinations that I can't place in the timeframe of the trip other than it was during the time I was on the couch. I remember the clock hands on the analogue clock on the wall just spinning and spinning, never stopping, never slowing. Every time I looked at the clock the hands still spun at the same rate and in the same way. I also saw the flower on the table slowly rotating, growing up, flowering, and withering, before growing up again as the cycle repeated ad infinitum. It was beautiful, the circle of life and all that jazz, but I only thought that that was one wack fucking flower. 

I also remember, it was either right before or right after the ego death I was sitting at the couch looking out on a long sandy beach, with a weird deep purple ocean in front, and a hazy green sky above. I believe The Beatles were playing over the speaker, but l looked out on this incredibly beautiful alien world. 

The most distinct feeling of mushrooms when compared to acid (at least by my own experience) is that to me the mushroom visuals always felt so real. It felt like looking at another rendition of our world with its own rules, it felt like an alternate reality. For me, the acid visuals always were muddled and confused, manically jumping from one thing to the next. It felt like a drug, mushrooms to me felt more like a portal to another world. This is best exemplified, i believe, by the consistency of some of the hallucinations like the clock and the flower. Those hallucinations stayed completely constant everytime I looked there. Also all the visuals sort of had a serene slowness to them, an almost deliberately relaxing pace of movement. Acid visuals are always so jumpy and manic that that attribute of the mushroom high stood out particularly well when I compared my acid trips to the mushroom one. 

I also remember at one point the room looked almost like a dollhouse, I had sort of a fish eye view of everything and it just felt fake. I cannot adequately articulate what it looked like, but it was like the world was made of a sort of glossy plastic and felt so completely unreal.

The last major thing I remember was smoking weed well into the comedown of the trip, I felt mostly sober by this point with that same sense of mental and physical exhaustion that accompanies a very long and hard day. I used to go on these long canoeing trips and it was the same kind of exhausting reflective feeling that would follow an entire day of paddling where you just completely lose yourself to the water and the movement of the canoe. 

The weed honestly kind of sucked, my head buzzed so completely it felt like a headache, but I remember looking up at the ceiling and seeing aztec styled art and patterns fading in and out of the ceilings, with the lines being a sort of neon white color against the dark tan of the ceiling in the diminished light. 

After that it was restless sleep, and waking up on that Saturday feeling like my entire world was up-ended. I got no after-glow, I got no real hangover, I just felt drained and I felt changed. I couldn't tell if I regretted the trip or not, I just felt like a different man. 

That is basically everything I recall from the trip, the rest is lost to the haze of insanity. It has been years since then, and I do not regret the trip one bit now. I wouldn't want to relive it per se, but it was a fascinating experience completely losing myself to a drug. I would not enjoy the feeling anymore, I value mental clarity too much to really surrender that level of control comfortably again (at least not until I try DMT a while down the line), but it was an amazing first experience in psychedelics and it is always fun to reminisce about the time I temporarily was insane. It struck me how in some ways the trip was exactly like how I imagined a trip would be, but at the same time so much more than I could have ever imagined short of experiencing it myself. 

I know that this is insanely long and I commend any of you who actually read the whole thing, but it was an experience I have never quite written down and it is something I do truthfully wish to share, but whether or not you read it is entirely up to you. For the sake of my own documentation of the experience, I wrote down quite literally everything about the trip that I can remember hence the obscene length.

26508,MDMA,Abilify and molly,"Hi. I hope this post doesn’t break any of the rules (which I read)! Please delete it if not. :)

Tldr: How long to wait after stopping Abilify before taking molly, and any personal experience stories would be great. 

I want to try molly. I attempted this about four weeks ago, to absolutely no avail. Everyone was having a blast and I was babysitting them. While they were all having fun, I realized that my Abilify may be dampening the effects, or nullifying them completely, which my research confirmed. I use mushrooms to treat mild depression twice a yearish and since my starting Abilify those effects are dampened, though not nearly as much as the molly. 

I have extremely mild bipolar, and I’m on the lowest dose of Abilify. I’ve been off my meds for a week before (a holiday trip that got extended and I ran out of meds) and I was totally fine and balanced emotionally (no hypomania or depressive episode), so I’m not afraid to stop my medicine for a little while. 

I’m curious, and I hope this question is allowed, but how long should I stop my medication prior to attempting this drug again? I have done research about this, but some sources say 3-4 days, while others say about 2 weeks, and I’m just looking for a straight answer (though I know everyone’s bodies are different) and perhaps some people’s personal experiences with this combo (or any other anti-psychotics). 

Thank you very much!

26662,Psychedelics,This is how psychedelics could be a blessing and a curse,"I love psychedelics so much, I won't stop taking them. BTW 22y/o

So my journey started last year on psychedelics since Feburay 2018. I have done shrooms so many times.  End of summer I did like an eight of shrooms a week for a while, haven't done them for 5 months now. I switched to LSD and currently doing it. 

They're great at building your character. They made me understand people in a way strange way. I notice things real quick about their character. When they speak, their facial muscles, tone, and body position says too much. Like you know their mindset. I would say my recall is excellent, never was the case before. People say things that contradicts what they said weeks or months ago. So founding people I could trust is kinda hard when you see their actions over a period of time.

I had to lose three friends cause I realized things about their character, I didn't like.

One is Sneaky

One is Manipulative 

One is Untrustworthy 

First before all that, I had to learn pretty much everything about myself. I accepted everything. I say things that I shouldn't be saying but I'm me and if you don't like it, there are 8 billion other people that might. I see what I have to do in my life but I noticed how much time I wasted because I been lying to myself. How much time I give to other individuals but not for myself. Kinda of kicked me in the face learning all this in one year, put a damper on me, see how I played my cards.

I wouldn't regret one bit, even if it hurt. If I never have done psychedelics, I would have been still clueless and dumb. 

I changed my mind to ""action mode"". Movies, YT, Social Media, can't enjoy it knowing where I'm at. Just been grinding non stop, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. If people stop my dreams from coming true, ill drop you.

It’s a surreal situation: we meet one week and a half ago, we’ve been in a sort of bubble with each other, never experienced this strong feeling with a guy starting from the very first time we went out. Even with my previous relationships, there is something different, a weird click, everything is extremely natural and genuine, we just purely enjoy each other’s company and it’s like we know each other since forever. Probably we met before in our previous lives as bugs or something. 
It’s really surreal for the both of us. We like eachother and understand eachother easily. I feel extremely comfortable with him like never in a very long time. 
He never tried acid and i did, twice. I also read a lot, very interested in psychs and i consider myself a good trip buddy. 
Maybe it is really too soon to try acid together, but there is already so much intimacy and natural enjoyment that i don’t see how it could improve much from a trust prospettive any time soon.   
So i think i would try. Low doses for the both of us, like 100 each. Does anyone have any thoughts of suggestion about this? 
Also sexing. We already have this super intense alignment on sex, extremely open, passionate and healthy. There is chemistry, that’s all. Would it be a good experience or are there any risks i am not considering? 
I feel like i am trying to convince you readers and so myself that this is a good idea 😅 but i truely feel good with him. So i don’t see a possible bad trip or outcome just because we just met. If you have similar experiences please share them! 🌈

I usually smoke once  every like 3-4 weeks so I knew it would fuck me up but I got hella paranoid from it especially since we were in such a public place. I remember being in line with the homie and deadass the whole 2 hour wait for space mountain, we're just looking at people and staring at shit. I was listening to peoples conversations and replying in my head. I kept feeling super anxious and i realized later that it was probably because everyone knew me and my friend were tripping balls since we went a whole 2 hour wait without saying one word to each other. 

The actual ride felt hella good bc space mountain got that nice fake galaxy with stars and shit but after the homie was like ""ay i gotta yack"" lmao. so we just sat in the main street park thing thats in the middle of disneyland but I started getting hella paranoid because I felt like someone was watching us. Disney has secret agents who dress up as guests and just chill and watch people to make sure no bad shit is going on. Well I notice this one middle aged asian guy in like a vest which is like formal enough to seem like some eccentric guy at a amusement park but when I looked closer he had a name tag and was holding a bag for an ipad. 

So anyways, this guy sits on a bench next to us and opens up the ipad and just chills there for like 10 min. I think, huh okay weird but whatever. I take a glance at him a few minutes later and i catch him with side eye looking at us!!! Dog, that shit sent me over the edge I got so paranoid I started freaking out. cuz I knew he was watching us. I keep watching this dude and I kid you not 5 minutes later he gets up walks into a crowd like he's looking for something  and comes out 20 seconds later from the same crowd but on a different side of the park thing. He sits down and takes out his ipad again and does the same routine and all this time im watching him high af and its probably hella obvious. I eventually realize I'm practically out of my seat watching this guy and I feel like he knows so I start telling my friend yo we gotta get the fuck outta here, there's a guy watching us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just so you know this whole time me and my friend haven't said one word to each other since we got off the ride.

Now me and the homie head down main street and the whole time we're dodging people and it's getting hard to walk and I swear to god every other person that passed us looked like an undercover agent with like headpieces and shit. Idk if it was my paranoia or I was actually seeing it but I legit feel like there were guys tailing us. My friend was lagging hella far behind but I was mobbin so fast. Once we get back to my car my friends like "" Dude why were you walking so damn fast."" I tell him its bc there was fuckin people tailing us legit all the way out of the park. anyways we're too fucked to drive so we sit in the car for like 3 hours and the homie is just passed the fuck out. meanwhile I'm falling asleep but I wake up hella scaredevery 10 seconds because i keep feeling  like a disney employee is going to approach my car and take me the fuck out. so that happens for like 3 hours and finally I've had enough. I just want to go home but we're too fucked to drive so I just uber home while my friend just chills in his car until he's good to drive. 

&amp;#x200B;

That entire uber ride was quiet except when the guy tried to make conversation about how hard it was raining and I legit said ""yeah.."" and then he continued driving for 30 minutes in silence. I wasn't able to think straight  until the next afternoon.

Moral of the story is: don't take edibles in public places.

26894,Psychedelics,About my 25X-Nbome experience,"Funny enough, my experience with psychedelics began with this substance. More funny is that I did it a lot of times until one really bad trip, which I will describe later.

At the place I'm from lsd is kinda expensive. So, a lot of people who want to trip on ""acid"" actually end up consuming nbome. 

Before I even knew about responsible use and such, I'd always wanted to try this ""acidy"" type of experience. Like, seeing visuals, thinking stuff about universe and such. 

Once my friend gave me a blotter of paper and told me that it was acid, but not lsd. He told me to hold it under my tongue. The taste was bitter, my mouth numbed. 
The experience itself was... Good. Like really, I had a great time. I don't know the dose, though. I did it times after that. It was good, even though I had this mental fatigue for a couple of days later. If someone told me at that point that Nbome was dangerous, I would just scratch my head. Why in the world? I never bad tripped on it.

So once I was ready for some irresponsible experience. I knew I was taking Nbome, I knew that dose was higher than usual, but it was just ""acid"", right? Even if it was cheap fake lsd.

Wrong. 

I still don't know the dose. But from my mouth numbing more than usual I knew it was high.

Everything started out great. As always. Laughing, getting confused a bit, starting to see these whirlwindish visual distortions. 
At some point it overwhelmed me.

I lost the ability to speak. Just imagine that the ""thoughs - speech"" translator just broke. It was like all the thoughts sticked to some kind of ribbon, and at this ribbon they disintegrated, all these disintegrated pieces changed places with one another, some of these got erased, and then this mash of nonsense got out of my mouth. I really tried to hold them together, to say something that made sense, but I just couldn't. I had to communicate with gestures while making strange sounds and saying strange words. 
I started to get afraid that I won't be able to speak anymore. 

At this point, something... Divine got into my head. I couldn't see the creature, yet I knew it was some kind of god. It told me that I crossed the line. It told me that it would show me all the answers to all the mysteries of the universe. Which it did, actually. I saw some... Very strange and complex internal hallucination. It is very hard to explain, but it looked like some kind of painting. The creature told me that there they all are, the answers I've been looking for consuming the substance. But it also told me my human mind was too primitive to grasp the form of them. So I won't be able to describe or explain them even to myself.

I really detached from reality. I couldn't see anything but these internal visions, yet I'm sure I was awake just sitting at one place unable to speak. I knew that I discovered the ""real"" reality, and it wasn't pleasant at all. Like all what we see is just a veil, beyond which there is a truly endless, terrifying realm where nothing we knew made sense, and nothing could be understood. I knew that our reality is just a trick to keep us sane, because human brain is not capable of understanding what is ""real"".

And about crossing the line...
The creature then told me that for trying too hard to find the answers I was to be punished. Punished with some mental disease. I was doomed to knowing the truth with no one to ever believe me. Psychedelics were accidentally left by the divine as a key that was never meant to be found. Yet it was, and they were ready to hold the door. 

I was really terrified, still couldn't speak properly. The peak then started to wear off, I was trying to hold myself together not to freak out.

Then I thought of how inferior humans are, myself included. Our key instrument of communication -- the language -- is based on distinguishing things from one another, drawing borders between things and concepts. People badly understand abstract things, like ""love"", for example. Ask anyone, and they will all give you different definitions of this. That's because love is not an object, has no clear borders and cannot be described. 

At that point I understood I wanted to die. Because of how inferior I was. Because of how badly the divine punished me. 
I tried to stand up, go to the window, open it, and jump. 
Well, my body was too heavy, and I just fell to the floor. My friend (oh, I even had a trip sitter, ha-ha) asked me if I was okay. I thought that maybe I should sit a bit longer and die when I'm alone.

But as the sanity was returning to me, I thought...
""If I am meaningless as a being, then my death is also meaningless? If all my actions are meaningless, then all I don't do is as meaningless? And if they are equally meaningless, then maybe I should do what is easier to do? Thus, do nothing""
Maybe this one saved my life. I don't know.

Then I gained the ability to speak, told some bad insulting things to my trip sitter. I still don't know to this day if he felt bad about my words. 

I returned to our reality while still having these psychedelic visuals. I was really scared. I don't know if I really got punished with mental disorder that day, but some thoughts from the bad trip still echo in my head. Otherwise I feel okay. Just promised myself not to do nbome anymore.

27052,Triazolam,"I have a dislocated ankle, broken tibia and fibula. I need Halcion.","I should start by saying I'm really not an ""opioid person"", but I'm able to appreciate an opiate Rx or two.

Yesterday was my 2-week follow up appointment after having arrived at the ER with a dislocated ankle and fractures to both leg bones.  Obviously they threw every legal opiate at me, when I arrived with those injuries.  I expected that.

I haven't been in any real pain since day 4, or so.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, my pain level was zero when I arrived at my appointment.  I got my cast swapped for a removable, inflatable boot.  Before that, I saw the surgeon's assistant who said everything was looking great re: my x-rays.  He asked me if I was out of meds.  I told him I ran out a couple days ago (true - 500 mg oxycodone consumed in the prior 2 weeks.  I couldn't even believe it).

Without indicating verbally or anywhere on paper that I was experiencing any amount of pain, the Dr. automatically wrote me a script for 400 mg more oxycodone.  The word pain was never uttered.  The closest thing was when the technician told me the staples she was about to remove from my leg might sting a little.

It was one of the most disappointing prescriptions ever.  I didn't even have to try.  There are other meds that would have helped me more.  I'm still glad I have something over nothing.  The clinic's super-liberal prescribing practices just took all the fun out of it.

On the other hand, I am probably an outlier, with no pain 2 weeks after ankle surgery.  It was certainly a safe assumption.  I was going to go for Halcion though (a challenge &amp; the only Rx benzo I know of that I haven't tried).  I've just been using the pain meds for sleep anyway.  But once I automatically got the oxy, I didn't feel like I had much to work with.

I feel like, with the boot-cast and the walker, that I have a 'Press Pass' when it comes to the war on opiates.  I want to be able to go in for a follow up on a broken ankle and come out with triazolam.  That would have been a win for me.

27083,Psychedelics,my egodeath story,"hey drug fam, i’m in love with this sub and i thought i’d share something that happened to me monday evening. 

for a little context, i’m a full-time stoner and part-time psychonaut. i have only ever done LSD and magic mushrooms, but i smoked DMT once. it was too little to break through, but i definitely felt it. i have also used xanax, adderall, cocaine, and probably some other stuff, my memory isn’t the best. 

so, monday, my best friend and i bought 7 grams of mushrooms to split between the two of us. (3.5g/3.5g). we decided to eat them in her sister’s apartment while watching planet earth II (would 100% recommend while tripping, it’s my go-to LSD program). we just ate them straight and we both took about 1000mg of vitamin C. here’s how it went. 

3:45: we had just finished eating the shrooms, nothing had kicked in yet obviously. we sat on the couch and watched nature do it’s thing with david attenborough’s beautiful voice to guide us. 

4:05: my best friend starts feeling them, but i’m not having anything yet so i take another vitamin C pill (we both took one right after we ate them). she says the visuals are crazy and i’m getting kind of jealous but it’s only been 20 minutes so i just waited it out. enjoyed planet earth. 

4:45: at this point, my friend is tripping pretty hard and she’s watching the tracers on her hand as she moved it back and forth. she started saying that she felt everything and nothing and leaned back super far into the couch. i’m still not feeling anything. at about 4:50 i felt a super strong tingling in the back of my neck. 

5-9:45: i’m not quite sure the exact timing of everything because at 5 i started to die. i had no come-up or anything, my vision just went blurry all of a sudden and i started seeing mandalas and forgetting what i am. 

at first i forgot where i was and what i was doing, and then i wasn’t human anymore. i was a formless entity, void of meaning or expression. i felt the world around me start to cave in. i think i fell off the couch because my friends sister said “miss keisha! oh my fuckin god she fuckin dead” and that’s when i started to believe i was dying. as i lay there, i started seeing visions that i now realize was all of the decisions i had made in my life in front of me, but in the moment i had no idea what i was seeing. all of a sudden, i was in a white tunnel and i saw my recently deceased grandmother, who i recognized, though only vaguely. she was wearing what she wore the last time i saw her and she acknowledged me and nodded. then everything ended. my consciousness was gone and there was nothing. i couldn’t see or hear and i thought i had died.

9:50 i came to on the couch with my face in some orange juice i had apparently poured in a tray on the table in front of me. my friend was already over her peak and she looked at me and said “i know, we’re alive.” i felt like a completely different person and discussed my trip with my friend and her sister. my friend said that she also had the experience of dying and becoming nothingness and i’ve never felt more connected to her. we experienced egodeath at the same time.

i have struggled with depression and chronic suicidal tendencies my entire life, but since then i have felt nothing but gratitude for my life and i feel invigorated in a way i’ve never felt before. i’ve completely flipped the way i’ve been functioning and i’ve started writing my goals down and actually being productive. i’ve done more for myself today than i have in the past week. life feels good again and i just want to praise mushrooms for their healing ability and their mystical power. i love you all, please stay alive. 

TL;DR: i took 3.5 grams of mushrooms and 1000mg of vitamin C and died, came back to life completely different and not depressed. also the visuals on the comedown were pretty litty. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aiwd39/my_egodeath_story/

27177,Cannabis,Smoking weed vs edibles mood elevation?,"Hey everyone. I’m an insomniac with sleep anxiety (basically I get anxious around bed time and also get a killer urge to pee!) and for several years I’ve been prescribed ambien for nightly use. It works amazingly and I don’t have the blackout drunk effects some people get. It just gives me a strong sense of relaxation, anxiety relief and a pretty good euphoria, not unlike a mild opiate high. However, the long term effects have really diminished my memory, concentration and energy during the day. I also have a pretty strong tolerance now. I have been doing therapy but it’s a slow, expensive process. 

So, Ive been considering substituting with marijuana in the evening to relax before bed time. I’m not completely new to weed. I smoke with friends a few times a year, but not often enough to be very knowledgeable on the subject. So, I had a few questions about the best strains for mood elevation/euphoria and relaxation. Not necessarily a heavy body high, but something closer to a floaty euphoric high,  not unlike a mild opiate or kratom high. I also wanted to ask about the difference between smoking, vaping etc. vs edibles? Edibles seems like the easiest route for a quick night cap, but I heard there’s no strains with edibles? Does that mean they’re less euphoric?

It's like it opens up new or unused pathways. I've been able to realise what alot of my insecurities are and how trying to suppress those insecurities, among other factors, really shaped the personality I have today. 




I would say my personality really changed around halfway through grade 7. Before that, I was a nice, polite, kid because that's how I mainly taught in grade 5 and 6. But in grade 7 I learnt that acting like that isn't really considered ""cool"" so I got mildly teased it as a result. But I think more than anything, I was a sensitive kid, and I cried a few times during middle school, which really felt like shit to me. So I think as a result of that, I really changed my outlook and behaviour to be far more apathetic and cynical. It was a coping mechanism in essence, to mask any insecurities I had.



Shits weird to think about. Maybe I'm just high but alot of this makes sense to me in my head. Goodnight dawgs

27250,In memoriam,How I Lost My Eye On Embalming Fluid,"It was winter of 2013 in Wellington, New Zeala

nd. I had just recieved my brown belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. In my gym we had a tradition of having orgies everytime someone got promoted to a new belt. It didnt matter if you a man or woman etc, it was just the way things were done, and who was I to refuse such an offer? 

We rented the entire second floor of a local pub for the festivities prior to getting freaky at some ungodly hour of the night. Let me tell you, these guys and girls spend all day rolling around on the floor so you can imagine my excitement to spank the monkey. Anyway, I get the bright idea that I would go into the bathroom at this pub during the party and hotbox some left over Embalming fluid left over from my mate Dave's untimely accident. 

It worked extremely well and the whole place is just smoked out like this little cubicle becomes a spaceship to mars. I'm actually buzzing like a wasp. Just floating around the room enjoying the moment. I dont really remember too well what happened next but the court was sure to remind me. Basically I walk out of the bathroom and sneak up behind this fat Chinese geezer. The whole room changes and I envisage myself in the octagon with Steven Wonderboy Thompson. This was my moment to seize glory and apply a choke to this chinese bloke. Basically what happens is I choke him out and he falls and cracks his head on the floor. Lets just say he's not singing anymore. Infact hes lucky to be alive. 

Meanwhile his wife charges me with a fork and stabs me in the eye like a crazed chimpanzee. It was not how I had imagined this night would go I'll tell you that for free... when life throws you lemons make lemonade. That's what I did.

Fast forward 2 years smoking on and off nothing crazy, but recently I started smoking 5-6 times a week and started liking it kinda. I sometimes will get the slight paranoia and anxiety but I’ve learned how to deal with it and sort of cope and learned to enjoy it more and more. 

My question :

Probably about 70% of the time I smoke I sort of get restless I guess you could say, and I shake. I don’t know why it’s not always like I’m cold but my whole body just shakes, I don’t know if anybody smoking with me can tell but I just wanted to know if anybody else has had this.

i cried to him and he cried to me saying how he feels so bad and he won’t do it and if he happens to he’ll let me know, but he’d be stopping all together and he’s not gonna lie to me anymore 

After that curiosity, got the best of me (of course) and i saw texts on his phone asking someone if they wanna meet up to shoot cause he just got a bag and things like that

27479,LSD,I think the amount of acid I've taken in my life has fucked up my social activity.,"So I'm not saying I've taken so much acid in my life, or bragging about how much acid I've taken. I'm just saying that the amount of times I've been bored enough to take acid, has out-weighed the amount I haven't. It was when I moved from home at the age of 18 for about 4 years and was in North Carolina. I found it about 2.5 years I was there and was dropping every weekend since. Not as an addiction (even though I probably was) but just because me and my friends were bored. Plus drinking was getting us in trouble.

Anyways, I quit dropping about 6 months ago and like 2 months after I realized I had lost all normal social activity. I moved home, sober, and reconnected with some friends from highschool and moved in with my best friend I knew since we were like 10. Obviously all my friends had made new friends and expanded their social circles and they wanted me to join in. Everyone knew I had moved back and only had like 2 or 3 people I actually knew so of course they'd invite me out and I'd accept and we'd all get drunk and have a good time.

The thing is, this was the first time interacting with people I've never met before while being a good 6 months off the cid. I was noticing things I'd never noticed before when meeting new people. 

The most talked about thing is OTHER PEOPLE. Shit that is nobody else's business. I couldn't care less about this imaginary person I've never heard of. Everyone I talked to seemed to be entirely interested about themselves. Every conversation I had with anyone was basically an interview of them. I would leave open opportunities for them to ask a question about myself, or what I did while I was gone, or why I moved back. I don't mean I wanted the conversation to switch sides and become about me, but I would answer a question by saying ""ya I had to do that in NC."" Not to try to steer the conversation towards me, but just to see if they would even ask. I was interested in what they had to say and wanted to know more about them. 

Now I don't care as much, I see through the fakeness, bitchiness, and pseudo listening. It doesn't annoy me anymore because I realized it's not a big deal. As an adult you'll run into more things you disapprove of then you actually do. I'm more just curious if anyone else has experienced this issue after being off acid for a minute or two. 

TL;DR: Has anyone else taken so much acid, it made being social sober difficult, or if it just made you realize how fake, self-interested, and gossip obsessed everyone is? ",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aj1uts/i_think_the_amount_of_acid_ive_taken_in_my_life/

27531,Story Time,My first drink was alcohol I brewed myself in secret from my parents (12 years old),"Around the shy age of 12 I was in 6th grade and I had my first drink. Not unheard of, but as you can tell by the title, it was alcohol I brewed myself. I had no intention of drinking it in fact. I saw it as a money making scheme. 

I did some research and found the easiest way to brew up what can only be called a mildly better version of prison hooch. A simple combination of yeast and sugar, which is essentially the Finnish beverage Kilju. I took 4 gallon jugs out of the family recycle bin on trash day and started planning. I didn't have money to buy the ingredients so I got a friend onboard to do the dirty work in exchange for money I'd get from selling this god awful butthole brew. 

He stole large amounts of sugar and baker's yeast from the nearby store, stuffing his entire backpack full of it. I got to work. I barely measured it and simply put it all together in 4, gallon sized milk jugs with tiny holes poked in the lid to let the pressure out. I hid it in my closet and let it brew for about 6 weeks, adding more yeast and sugar in random intervals. I was constantly asked by my parents ""What the hell is that smell?"" but they never found it or caught on.

Finally it came time to drink it, but there was far too much yeast floating around so I needed to filter it out. I had my friend steal a Brita water filter, but he got caught. Thankfully no repercussions as he was so young.  Not my proudest moment having someone else do my dirty work, though I can only imagine the confusion the workers felt catching a 12 year old trying to steal a Brita water filter. I opted to use coffee filters instead and to give it some flavor I used Kool-Aid powder and sugar.

I decided to finally test it and to my surprise, it was not half bad. I decided to keep 1 of the 4 gallons for myself. After only a few sips I was FUCKED UP. The Finnish drink, Kilju afformentioned is often between 15 and 17% alcohol content and that's essentially what I brewed, so this was pretty strong stuff. Maybe not that strong, but way stronger than beer 🍺, that's for sure. 

Through my high school brother I managed to sell the remaining 3 and made $80. Desperate high school students will buy ANYTHING. It's almost pitiful that they would buy that, but they did!  $80 goes a long ways when you're 12. I kept on sipping that gallon for a few weeks until it was gone. 

EDIT: The alcohol sold to the high schoolers did NOT have Kool-Aid in it, nor was it filtered. They were given a sample first but we're still interested, despite the ""pulp"" from all of the yeast  They still bought it 

I don't know if it's pride I feel from brewing alcohol at such a young age, but it is definitely gave me an interesting story to share with people being that my first drink was self brewed. I put in the work and it paid off!



TLDR: I brewed 4 gallons pretty strong alcohol at the shy age of 12 in my closet, hidden from my parents using only stolen yeast and sugar. Flavored with Kool-Aid and sugar. Kept 1 for myself and sold 3 of them to high schoolers for $80. ",1977,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aj2lyo/my_first_drink_was_alcohol_i_brewed_myself_in/
27534,Cannabis,"I tried quitting weed, and it made me understand why this glorious plant is on the same planetoid as us.","I tried quitting weed because of how aware I became on it, but I now know how helpful it is, and that to try and resist that understanding of those nebulous and fractured realizations about the way I am the way I am. 

Terence Mckenna put it best when he said 

&gt;“No other drug can compete with cannabis for its ability to satisfy the innate yearnings for Archaic boundary dissolution and yet leave intact the structures of ordinary society. If every alcoholic were a pothead, if every crack user were a pothead, if every smoker smoked only cannabis, the social consequences of the ‘drug problem’ would be transformed. Yet, as a society we are not ready to discuss the possibility of self-managed addictions and the possibility of intelligently choosing the plants we ally ourselves to. In time, and perhaps out of desperation, this will come.”

Marijuana is our friend! Marijuana is a way to expand your mind. Why don't we completely understand as a society that it is, in fact, a very good thing for a society like ours to have.

This logic, I think, explains our long-held relationship with cannabis and why I personally believe some humans were born on Earth with a cosmic destiny to be a shaman or druid-like individual, though complexly fit into our modern lives. Though I'll touch on that in another post, maybe.

27535,Methamphetamine,Is my new roommate a meth user?,"When my new roommate first moved in he stated he was a quiet guy who sometimes plays guitar and has a girlfriend who may be over 2 or 3 nights a week. I noticed that some unflushed piss had a very ammonia smell. The guy himself has sores on his face and arms and I can hear him itching sometimes. I also heard a lighter and his girlfriend saying ""we should get more of this tommorow"". I went over to see what was up under the guise of getting some stuff I left in the room when it was empty. They were sitting face to face and he came and gave me my stuff in a friendly way. I didnt see any visible smoke but there may have been a slight sweetish smell when they were doing it. I was stoned myself and not sure if that part was in my head. I also asked them some roommate stuff as an opportunity to bring it up. When I mentioned hard drugs they denied that they do them and said it wouldn't be an issue. That made me happy for about ten minutes until I realized addicts lie all the time. He also mentioned his girlfriend would effectively be living there with him which was not what he had told us initially. They themselves also have a slight ammonia smell. Is this enough for me to be sketch enough to kick these people out. I dont wanna be rude if I am completely off base but I dont know how to know for sure.

27549,Psychedelics,Tripping really makes you question time,"I had a trip with 3 of my friends and all of us took a tab and it being one of my first times I continuously checked the time. We spent most of our peak smoking weed and watching off the air. The screen was messed up so it showed the length of the video and I just kept focusing on the fact that time was going by as slow as it was. 

Everybody was laying down listening to music and I checked my phone and time was going slow as hell. It was at that point where I told everybody I was with that I loved them and every single one of them their best feature about them. And after that pulled my phone to check the time. I felt as if I went through a speech to each one of these people within 2 minutes. It made me question how fast I really spoke. I felt as if I just talked to them each for 10 minutes.

Making it worse it was winter and it was getting dark outside really quickly. I questioned that. Decided to look it up on google and its cause the earth tilts and time is actually going by faster. Making me question what time is it really. Cause its 5 PM and I have no clue why it looks like its midnight.  

Time is very important and since then I tend to question how time goes by as slowly and quickly as it does. I have the understanding of keeping you busy makes time fly by. And doing nothing makes time feel like it's at a standstill. But God damn father time is a bitch.

27577,Methylphenidate,Concerta pill mechanism (helpful for people wanting alternate the dosage and duration),"**So this is a bit of a random post but it was something that took me a look time to figure out..**

Concerta slow release pills are made up of **5 parts:**

* **Part 1** is the outer layer. This layer contains roughly about 25% of the methylphenidate. This layer gets quickly absorbed by instant release. (Even quicker if hold in mouth, and not swallowing instant).
* **Part 2** is the layer beneath the red/white/yellow outer layer (clear), and works as a water membrane to slowly absorb water inside the pill. This layer i believe contains small to 0 methylphenidate.
* **Part 3** is the ""sponge"". This layer also contains small to 0 methylphenidate and is the main mechanism for slowly Administering the dose over 12 hours. 
* **Part 4** and **5** are the main compartments being slowly pushed out, by the sponge expanding. The first half of the pill contains ca. &lt;25% of the methylphenidate and stabilizes the plasma-concentration of methylphenidate by keeping it at  stable level until Part 5 containing &gt;50% of the methylphenidate and making the peak at 6-8 hours.

Watching the picture below makes it easier to understand.

*A link to the graph over plasma-concentration by time is linked here:* [*http://adhd-institute.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Methylphenidate-PK-Concerta-XL.jpg*](http://adhd-institute.com//wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Methylphenidate-PK-Concerta-XL.jpg)

27582,Psychedelics,Candyflipping changed my life.,"It was NYE a couple of weeks ago, I was with two of the closest people in my life staying in a different state and we all decided that one of us (refer to them as Sam) would be trip sitting me and my girlfriend. We had everything dosed and tested prior to the trip so everything was all in check.

Since it was my girl's first time doing M, I really encouraged her to just do that to really take in her first time experience. We both dosed at exactly 8:30 PM (I dropped my 150 UG tab &amp; she dropped her 100mg of M). We started off the night by watching the new Black Mirror Bandersnatch episode and we had a pot full of green tea next to us, about 20 minutes in I started laughing hysterically and I could not control myself I just knew I was in for quite the ride.

Mind you this is my first time dropping acid in 7 months so I didn't realize how strong these tabs were. I felt so comforted by these two people next to me and it was a genuine type of love that I don't necessarily feel all the time because I'm so dulled out from how much weed I smoke.

About an hour in we were wrapping up the Bandersnatch episode which was absolutely insane especially when they both dropped tabs I totally felt in sync with everything they were talking about, the fact that you could make choices and decide the fate of the characters made me feel like their life depended on me.

After it ended I really had an urge to skate around outside even though it was drizzling so everyone came with me and we had music blasting in the middle of this suburb neighborhood we never been to before prior and I just felt so great. I kept checking up on my girl to make sure she was okay and she was in denial that the M would work because at this point she didn't feel feel anything other than some come up anxiety she said maybe I should take another; all I said was ""oh just wait, it'll hit you"" and indeed it did.

After I finished skating we all went inside me and my girl's room and she started massaging the carpet and she just had that look in her eyes that I've seen in myself multiple times while rolling; complete ZEN state of mindframe. I then started to run my fingers through her hair and she was getting quite the kick out of it.

At this point we're two hours in I started to get into what it felt like a never ending thought spiral about my drug usage (mainly weed) and how I use it as a crutch. For the first time in my life at that point I said I feel like I have a drug problem because I rely on weed for basically everything in my life and I'm a different person without it. It was at this point I realized I overlooked it because ""it's just weed"" and I had no choice but to surrender to the truth. 

My girl started to comfort me and it felt like weight was lifted off my shoulders, I don't remember this part but both people I was with told me I kept repeating that I feel like I'm dying in a calm manner, thus entering the ego death. It was a very eye opening experience and fast forward 30 minutes later I decide I'm going to take my M capsule (140 mg) and we're just all chilling in the room talking about life and what we can make of it.

To my surprise only 30 minutes passed until I started to feel the M hit me at full speed and I realized why they call it a candy ~flip~. Oh my god I never have felt so much energy and although I tested what I ingested I was convinced for a moment I was doing coke even though I've never tried it. 

I started to get up and do push ups and jump up and down I ran to the bathroom full of energy and scratched the sink like a literal crack head, I eventually drank not only my tea but my girl's tea in 2 big gulps. She was laying on the floor mentally and physically rolling in a zen like state meanwhile I'm going balls to the wall speaking a mile a minute saying ""we HAVE to get the FUCK out of here RIGHT now"" to Sam.

We eventually all went to the car and I've never had this type of energy in my life. I've rolled a couple of times prior but usually it hits me like a wave of euphoria and I lose my ability to move but I was ready to bounce at any given moment. We all hopped in the car and Sam had a playlist ready to go.

When I tell you I was on a different level of upbeat energy I literally could not describe what I was seeing; to the best of my ability it felt like a bunch of vibrant colors whirling around like how a photo looks when it captures light on slow shutter speed, only everything was 2x the speed of normal reality.

My girl and I are in the back and she looks like she's having a great time until I scream to the top of my lungs ""HOLY MOTHERFUCKING SHIT I AM INFINITE"". Dick move on my part because it startled the shit out of her zen element making her emotional and I had to calm down because I was too in my zone. Collard Greens - ScHoolboy Q is amazing to listen to while rolling I recommend to anyone high or sober. 

Every 30-40 seconds I assume I'd just stop dancing in my seat to give her a passionate kiss and it felt so bliss, like electricity was being transferred between our lips. For those who have rolled with their partner know exactly what I'm talking about I didn't want to start feeling up on her because it would've made Sam very uncomfortable who was driving through the streets braking and skrting to get us goin'. 

We eventually park back where we were staying and Sam started to smoke a joint of some Chem Dawg and I asked for them pass it to me even though not too long ago I was telling them how I really felt about weed if just overpowered me because weed while rolling alone is just amazing. We started to get deep into convo and keep in mind I've been looking forward to this experience because my girl has PTSD from past experiences and I know how beneficial M would be for her.

She started opening up about so many things she's been repressing for so long due to the living situation she's in. I won't get too deep into it but to sum it up she finally felt like she has a choice in her life and she kept expressing she's never been able to open up about her past childhood traumas in a way where she doesn't feel triggered. I'm in a different planet while this conversation is going on between Sam and her but she was breaking down crying happy tears and I got very concerned but everyone assured me that she's okay. 

We eventually got to 11:59 PM and the beat to the song Man of No Ego - Galactic Girl dropped right as the clock hit 12:00. Seriously this moment was so surreal for me because I genuinely love these people without the drugs but I've always had a hard time expressing it because I hate feeling vulnerable but I was expressing how much I care for them and cherish the moments we have. 

Eventually Sam feels slumped from the bud and decides to leave the car to go to sleep and my girl and I just started talking for hours about how we feel towards each other and how different being together is because we both have been in toxic relationships in the past. I don't like comparing people but to this day just something so different about her.

Anyways, our talk is still significant to this day and it was very heart to heart. At this point, we both have came down and It ended after I said ""oh shit, we didn't fuck while rolling"" which lead to us going to our room and my serotonin depleted body ended up on top of her, it didn't last long because I ended up passing out but let me tell you I slept like a god damn baby. I woke up naked feeling like it was the first time I ever woke up next to her. To thank our trip sitter we ended up paying for her to get her first tattoo to show our gratitude for taking care of us.

Rolling is a very pleasant experience when respected and used with care, it works as a psychedelic in certain ways and it has brought me closer to my girl and I'm very grateful for that. This story is a bit overdue but I've never posted in this sub reddit even though I love scrolling through, it's a tight knit community and it's crazy how a love for drugs brings people together you wouldn't normally associate with in the real world. I should mention that I've been off all drugs since then and plan to keep it that way until I feel ready to explore new depths.

27589,Cannabinoids,weed has changed my dreaming.,"little bit of backstory first. i’ve been smoking bowls everyday for 5 months now , with a few tolerance breaks here and there. i use it mainly for my severe depression and anxiety, because it’s the only thing that truly makes me feel like a better and more positive person at this point. antidepressants give me bad stomach pain and i don’t have any interest in trying anything else due to having the addict gene in my family, and also because my mom has been sober for 3 years now, and i didn’t want to follow the same way she had to go through.

a lot has changed since i’ve been starting to use it, some minor and some major, but one thing i noticed the most was my dreaming/sleep. back then, i would almost never dream. it wouldn’t ever happen and i sort of just accepted it and didn’t really care in the end. it would happen here and there, but not for very long. 

eventually i bought my own weed for the first time and i smoked and got so high i thought i was standing on a planet when i looked down at my feet. everything felt so good and i felt so happy and because it made me feel like that, my dreams started to get more weird and lucid. for as long as i’ve been puffing bowls i’ve been starting to have more vivid and real dreaming and it’s wonderful. it feels like a totally difference experience and it’s amazing.

27596,Cannabinoids,My Pastor Parents Caught Me Smoking Weed Multiple Times,"  

I’m 20 years old and a junior at college. I’ve lived with my parents throughout my entire college experience due to their extreme strictness. They busted me smoking weed for the first time early last year. I tried to downplay it and say it was the first time, etc but they began regularly checking my room (which I didn’t know for a while) which led to them catching me again. I don’t smoke weed for recreation, I have ADHD and I’ve been off my meds for around 2 years and my insomnia is unbearable, so I smoke weed to help me sleep. I’m a very light user and often go 4+ months without a smoke.   
 

My parents just caught me for the third time today..left for class and came back to find my stash was gone. They’re both pastors and are both strongly against any sort of drug use and that includes alcohol. I’ve tried to explain to them why I smoked in the past and managed to convince them I had quit until today. The irony is I’d just come off a 5 month sober streak and had stocked up before they found it today but they’ll think I’ve been using the entire time. 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels really shitty to know they think I’m an addict, they’ve even tried to drag me to drug addiction counseling in the past but that was where I drew the line. They believe marijuana “destroys lives” and have given me several anecdotes on “so and so” who used to be extremely smart but is now a ‘vegetable’ because of weed. Honestly, I think getting high has numerous benefits but if it wasn’t for my ADHD I wouldn’t be smoking at all. This is a really major blow for me as I struggle hard with managing my ADHD everyday and weed honestly makes a difference.

Any advice?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aj3hf3/my_pastor_parents_caught_me_smoking_weed_multiple/

27621,alcohol,Very bad feelings after sobering up,"When I'm drunk I always get quite intense euphoria so of course I like to drink quite a lot. Usually drink once or twice per week to BAC of about 0.15. When I'm drunk I of course get very very euphoric to the point of being unbelivable it is a legal substance that induced it.
The problem is that after effects are getting slowly worse. No nausea or headache but just a lot of anxiety and completely irrational fears, low self esteem and feelings of guilt and depression. I never had problems with anxiety before. When I'm sober I don't give a fuck and I have high self esteem but for up to 36hours after my drinking episodes I feel scared, full of anxiety and have completely negative outlook on my life. Not fitting into hangover category if you ask me. Has a lot more in common with mild alcohol withdrawal.

27664,Psychedelics,Why do some people become depressed after using psychedelics?,"I just read a post followed by many comments expressing a dismay in the limitless potential of the mind, fear of infinity, emptiness.

I have found this limitless-ness, the infinity, is akin to emptiness as expressed by Buddhism. 

It is the void, which I believe is the source of what I am, and ultimately, what I am.

But, why does the void make one depressed? Fear? Holding onto the ego and its games?

I was a bit depressed in my teenage years, then at 18 I took too much acid, had a very difficult trip full of suffering and existential trials... eternal damnation, existential meaninglessness, many deaths a rebirths, loss, guilt, shame, in hell, at the bottom of eternal abyss, visions of my family crying as I died, seeing “me” as a buddha on a mountain top, seeing “me” helping people suffering through wars, famine, and poverty, etc. The whole thing.

I did not speak for 2 days after this trip. 

I also stopped “chasing the dragon”. I stopped seeking to get high from any drugs I could get my hands on. I quit cigarettes and began to seek control over my weed intake. 4 years later I stopped smoking completely.

I found yoga, (Zen) Buddhism, meditation, and spirituality. I found self-compassion, wisdom, strength and ambition.

I feel like I found myself in this emptiness, in infinity, the limitless potential of my mind showed me what I really am, rather than what I thought I was... which, back in my teenage years I associated with completely, leading to a cynical and depressed perspective on life.

I still trip a few times a year, and I still fear facing this emptiness, infinity, loss of ego... and sometimes I face it, sometimes I don’t, it depends on the set and setting... The trips aren’t always all fun and play, sometimes things feel very serious, as if I am messing around with karma of my eternal soul, changing my destiny for better or worst.

Yet, I just remember, this, here, now, is what I am, and exploring mind with drugs is part of my karma. 

There is no way I would never have had this terrifying yet ultimately gratifying experience.

I am, and that is enough.

So, do you fear this emptiness, why?",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aj46ni/why_do_some_people_become_depressed_after_using/

Im hoping on getting a really good teacher to prepare me for the entry exams, and weed obviously messes with your memory, im already unfocused af and unorganized by nature.

27693,LSD,Acid has now caused my eyes to over dialate when I'm sober,"So almost a month ago I did 2 tabs of acid about 100ug each and my trip was going great and I was about to hit my peak and I had the great idea to go and smoke some weed not knowing about the synergy it had with acid.

After I packed a small bowl and smoked I completely lost it and almost entered and ego death but somehow I was able to fight it off and hold on to reality by my finger tips.

After I started to comedown (still didn't know about the synergy with weed) I had about 2 hours until i was sober but my dumb ass went out to smoke a very fat bowl to try and sleep which caused my trip to start back up and hit a lot harder which is the last thing you want to have after experiencing a very bad trip.

Unfortunately I can no longer smoke weed because the acid has opened something in my brain which now causes weed to affect me and give me a psychedelic high and I suffered from flashbacks and feelings every night where my body feels slightly disccicociated like acid and now every night my eyes get very dialated. Their more dialated then usual even in bright lights but when the lights go off and I turn them back on my eyes are fucking huge.

27836,Cannabis,"Miss smoking marijuana, anybody else?","I will preface with this, I work in healthcare. The facility I work at there are frequent randomized drug tests, in which, there are no loopholes. Even if I wanted to use infrequently, it would be too much of a risk and I could potentially lose my medical licensure. Hence, why I can’t recreationally or medicinally smoke marijuana. 

I discovered marijuana in college. Oddly enough, I was an advocate against marijuana for a majority of my high school days. Flashback to college, I was the epitome of your every day washed-up athlete. I had taken up the gym and was into bodybuilding pretty hardcore. For the majority of my life, I have had a severe muscle cramping issue. I had seen my primary care physician multiple times, multiple specialists and without success had no luck adequately treating the cramps/spasms. The bodybuilding just made it incessenatly worse, it became unbearable...that is until I tried smoking weed.

I tried marijuana, because I read about how it had stopped seizures, alleviated cramps and being high was rated as a general good feeling. My good friends in college smoked daily multiple times a day. Fast forward, it worked. I was taking a huge risk, because even my school drug tested and I was smoking almost daily. I enjoyed it. Some of the best times of my entire life were spent high. Music sounds better, food tastes better, I slept better while high, I was always happy and laughing, my cramping/spasms were obsolete, I truthfully enjoyed things more. I disovered marijuana in my last semester of school, so I got about a good 6 months of smoking and enjoying it. 


Now, here I am almost 3 years later and I can’t partake. I used marijuana and viewed marijuana like it was medicine. I won’t be able to use the herb for the rest of my career without jeopardizing my career first. I was very discrete and very little people knew about me smoking, which is why I can’t talk about this to really anyone. So, here I am, on Reddit, venting. Wondering if there is anybody else out there like me? 

Maybe someday they will legalize it federally, find a way to test for RECENT use and I’ll be able to partake. One can dream, right?

However I have a lot of little 5mg IR blue pills intended as an afternoon booster for homework that I usually don’t take daily. I’d sneaked about 5 and put in my jacket pocket. So today I was wearing that jacket at school and was feeling kinda tired and gross when I got to school and realized I had put the blue pills in my pocket. I popped two in first period. I had had my 15mg XR thar morning—so 15 mg XR and 10 IR, 25 mg in total. I felt a little better. I’ve taken more of my prescription than prescribed before but I don’t abuse it often, and I don’t abuse it just to have fun but usually for studying or something or feeling more confident. So in second or third period I had two more. 35 mg in my body now. I felt pretty amazing, but not full on “high” since I do have ADHD. I had lunch and during fifth or sixth period I took the last one. 40mg. 

Came home 3 hours ago, have been working on homework, about 20-30 minutes ago I had two more 5mg IR pills. So today I have consumed 50mg of Adderall, 15mgXR (1 capsule) and 35mg IR (7 blue pills). 

I feel really anxious all of a sudden because my chest feels tight and my heart is kinda fluttery but not much it’s just mostly discomfort in my chest and kinda nervous in my stomach. I know I took much more than I’m used to, and I don’t feel HORRIBLE, but I just want to make sure I’m not gonna die or anything, because my chest is tight. I heard a horror story from the holistic weight loss dietician I saw last year (lost over 20lbs yeet) who told me a client’s son’s friend took 1 Adderall and died.

So, I'm not new to drugs per se; I've done acid, shrooms, weed, among others, but I've never done MDMA. I reeeeally wanna do MDMA because of the things I've read about it helping people with social anxiety, I'm really not good at all things social whatsoever, I'm a huge introvert, kind of shy, and I really think that even tho MDMA obviously is not gonna turn me into a social butterfly overnight, it can help me see social interactions in a different perspective and point me in the right direction for me to work on my shit and eventually become the person I wanna be.

But why do I mention candyflipping? Well, because the first time I took LSD I ended up changing my major 3 days after tripping and 4 years later, it still is the best decision of my life. The acid did a lot of other positive things because at that time I was suicidal, but the changing majors thing explains itself. Anyway; the point is that, with my so far limited knowledge, I feel like candyflipping gives me the insights and teachings of Lucy, but with a serotonin bomb pumping that shit like a maniac, which, for something like social anxiety, I feel that it's like the ultimate power tool, specially because I start in my new job next week and you guys know how important first impressions are.

But the thing is that among the things I've read so far like not taking them at the same time and all that, I also read that I should take Molly alone first, I'm guessing that it is to understand the effects and all that before combining substances but I don't know if there's more to it that I should know.

I don't really need my IQ to increase 20 points or something - I can write more than well enough to ace the exam.  I'm not looking for a performance enhancer, inasmuch as I am looking for something to make me more conscious of time limits.  I have this terrible compulsive tendency that everything must be done to my image of perfection, so for a multi-part, time-restricted exam, I have found myself at a loss.

Practice exams have taken about an hour too long (33% longer than allowed), and while I submit stellar work, it's just too time-intensive.  I try to be pithy, clever, and articulate on everything, and find myself often carried away doing more work than necessary.

Now, most people would be laughing themselves silly right now, considering that amphetamines can typically make this sort of behaviour worse, but my experience has been nothing but the contrary.  When I started my medication, the dose actually broke this tendency and I would hand in something passably good (arrogantly, but that's what I need) and settle with it.  Sometimes it was worse than my standard, but worse then my standard was often pretty fucking decent.

This is after 3 and a half months of abstinence from “real” drugs (not complete sobriety because I smoked plenty of weed everyday along with the occasional psychedelic).

In the morning at school, I thought I was taking tramadol, turns out it’s trazodone, which just made me groggy and angry. 

After the school day had ended, I went to my friends house, where I consumed 50mg of actual tramadol. 
I waited 30 minutes - nothing.

My friend then found some blue capsules he was going to throw out, not knowing what they were (they literally look like a vitamin supplement).
But upon further inspection, I noticed “FIORICET” written clearly on the capsule.
I thought to myself... what a familiar name. It sounds like Percocet. So I thought it must be something psychoactive. Turns out it’s a headache medication that contains a barbiturate. It’s 325mg of acetaminophen (don’t worry, just took 1), 40mg of caffeine and 50mg of Butalbital.

Earlier today I was discussing with this very same friend how I had always wanted to try barbiturates. Wow.

So I ended up taking a second 50mg tramadol with the fioricet thinking I must get something good.

I later felt a nice opioid warmness, along with a distinct relaxation similar to Xanax. But I didn’t feel impaired. In fact it was quite mild, I’d call it an opiate buzz if anything. I was pretty clear headed, but slumped and euphoric.

However I'm aware that everyone is different, and I really don't want him to come to any harm. We'd probably stick to a 1st or 2nd plateau trip, maybe 250mg each (syrup)?

I was prescribed 20 mg IR adderall 2 months ago, I don't have ADHD/ADD, just wanted something that'd help me get shit done every once in a while. Usually I take half a pill to get productive and the other half if I really need to do something.

I eat pretty decent already (No fast food, no fried food or processed snacks). I count **all** of my calories, including sauces, nut butters and vegetables. Doing this has resulted in painstakingly slow weight loss and frustration. Typically I try to stay around 1200-1300 calories a day, I am open to going under if it will accelerate weight loss.

28146,Cocaine,I'm like some help writing a Non-human Character on Cocaine.,"It's for Trollhunter's fanfiction, please don't judge.

Main character's deadbeat dad comes back home after getting in trouble with a fellow cocaine dealer. He owes a lot of money and has three bricks of cocaine on him to sell to make it up. He wraps up a brick, inconspicuously, and sets it on the top of the garbage can (right outside garage) for his partner to pick up.

Enter his 16 year old son, who is recently turned half human/half troll, who eats garbage now. (See where this is going?) Jim takes the brick, thinking it's just trash, for lunch to eat at school. Now, I get that a person would die before even finishing the brick, but that's the fun of him being a troll.

Here's what I'm thinking, and I'm open to criticism:

Jim eats the brick for lunch, and then goes to gym. In the middle of a game of dodgeball, the drug takes effect and he goes on a literal rampage. His eyes dilate so that they're almost all black, and he's not really using words anymore. I know  he'd be depressed, angry, sick, and a handful of other symptoms when it was all over.

What kind of things do you think he would do? How long do you think the high would last? What other symptoms would he show? What would his behavior be like after?

I realize this is a very unrealistic question, but I really don't know much about drugs, so any advice or personal testimonies would help me out. (I googled it and most of the sources are just identifying symptoms and where to get treatment.)

I've had enough of it guys... it's just one thing after another. Last week my ex died of a overdose. This week I'm out binging for money blowing homeless guys in the back alley of Walmart. 
I can't take this life anymore, just last week I took a gig from my neighbor who wanted to use me as a model for his portrait. After 4 grueling hours of sitting upright, butt neked, he turns the canvas to show a realistic portrait of my left foot. 

**""you sick fuck""** 

How does a person spend 4 hours drawing just a single fucking foot?!?! 
Fucking criminal. 
Here I am, 6'2 220 pounds of pure country bred beef cake, butt neked, in front of him and he won't even draw my flaccid dick. 

Waste of time and money.

He eventually paid up the shillings, which he owed, and I'm on my way to my friends house to get high.

I shimmy up his veranda like always and start fingering his window. By now I'm starting to withdraw so I get super antsy. I start rapidly double tapping the window with my knuckles so it's very audible. Good, a person is walking up to said window. 

A girl, no older than 7, opens the blinds. Literally shit her undies; I was at the neighbors house... needless to say I kept persisting that my dealer lived there. Her father comes up and starts freaking out, something about ""killing me"".... Whatever.
I proceed to monkey swing across the veranda to the next house and break in since I'm 100% sure this ones my dealers.

28235,Cannabis,Need help from someone who had Bad Trip from Weed.,"So, hi.  
I started smoking weed in highschool, everything was fine, happy, laughs and funny stuffs like that.  
Then i left school at 16 years old and i smoked weed everyday for six months, i was smoking about 0.8/1g a day.  
After the six months i got a tongue infection so i stopped smoking everything for a month and tried smoking again after the infection was cured.  
There i got my first bad trip from weed, no hallucinations, just fear of death. My hearth was racing, palpitations, bad thoughts etc... (I went sleeping in my mom's bed because it was scary af).  
From that day, every time i smoke weed i get the same bad feelings, not that scary because i know everything was going to be fine, but i can't get a good high anymore.  
Did i get drug-induced psychosis? Is it chronic? Because now i feel every type of anxiety in my mind (Without panic attacks, luckly) and i think weed made his part. If I know that weed made me feel anxious i can get an adequate treatment.  
If you or someone you know had a similiar experience and found a solution please let me know, thanks.

28266,Cannabis,The first time I smoked weed was the best high I ever experienced,"Probably the first time I got high, I was with my two friends at the time in my one friend's garage away from his parents and the one guy who was a huge stoner (Was permafried basically) pulls out a small red pipe. I, at this time was ""straight edge"" for some reason... I don't really know why. Probably afraid to experiment. I was 18. (22 now)

The stoner passes me the pipe and a lighter. I try to play it off and say ""Oh yeah I did smoke this one time, I've totally done this before no biggie haha"" I proceed to not know how to use the lighter to light the bowl. He helps me light it. I don't know how to inhale but I breath it in and get pretty high and start laughing.

From that point, we all started joking and laughing and for the first time in years, I felt genuine joy. I wasn't just being quiet and awkward as I could tend to feel from anxiety a lot, I was having fun. I felt like a kid again. I was so euphoric, even when we were walking outside in the cold winter after deciding to go out. We ended up walking and walking and listening to some chill music on my phone. We ended up eventually finding an old abandoned couch in a forest and decided to chill there for a while. It was fucking cool. I felt so good. Eventually we headed back to my friend's place.

We had the munchies so fucking bad. This was my first experience with the munchies. I rummaged through my buddies kitchen cabinets looking to demolish any Oreos or Lay's in sight. After that we played some Skyrim and the feels were good. Just comfy and chill. I felt like I loved weed. And I did. Although later on in the night, another funny moment happened after sneaking in from another smoke sesh and being high as balls, I didn't really know how to handle myself infront of my friend's parents while we all had ot eat at his dinner table. I'd sit there with a goofy look on my face, my eyes glazed and a smirk that I was trying to hold back and whenever they'd ask me anything I'd try not to take a thousand years to respond or to burst out laughing. They asked me stuff and I'd just try and play it cool like ""Oh yeah, doing great. Yep. This food is delicious.. food is cool. Yep. Anyway, you might need to buy some more Oreo's""

I know that some people don't like movies/TV/video games/technology while on psychedelics but I enjoy doing a variety of different things for a few hours during a trip. I know GTA V is one of the go-to games to play while tripping but I am not sure if RDR2 would be quite the same. I am saying this because compared to GTA the world tends to be a lot more unpredictable, dark, dangerous (predators and robbers), and have a lot more fucked up shit (rival gangs/cannibals/random mauled bodies).

28419,Psychedelics,Introspection,"TL;DR I took about 100 ug and had some stuff to write about (depression &amp; anxiety). Read it if you want, it’s basically just me ranting. Some may find it helpful/relatable. Would appreciate some responses but even I don’t know what I’d respond to this

I took LSD for the first time in probably a year today. It felt like maybe 100 ug or less; I definitely wasn’t tripping but I still got really high. It was the threshold of visuals. I’m still really high and I just felt like I needed to reflect on the trip and on my life and I thought that the best way for me to keep my thoughts straight is to write them down. And figured this is as good a group as any to share it with.

I took the tab at around 7:45 pm and went with some friends to get food right after I took it. I didn’t feel it kick in until I was walking back to my dorm room at about 8:30. I smoked a little bit of herb and sat down hoping to trip soon.

My roommate got home at around 8:45-9:00. I was watching TV and he came in. He was gonna be my trip sitter Incase things got out of control but I didn’t expect to need one on one tab. He sat down and played some music. This is when I started to get really high. The kind of high that wraps your mind around itself. Your thoughts start racing, you seem to analyze everything and start to get caught up in your own mind. Things were slightly breathing and colors were changing around a little bit.  He asked if I wanted to play rocket league and so we did for a while.

This is where my high (I can’t really call it a trip) got introspective. I’ve been suffering from worsening depression, and really bad anxiety for a bit less than a year now. I’m struggling trying to figure out where this comes from. After this trip it’s way more clear to me. 

While we were playing games or watching tv I was sitting in my bed thinking about what my roommate is thinking of me. It began to take over my mind in the sense that I’d do things in order to make myself seem more normal to him. And by normal I don’t mean sober, I mean normal as a person. Normal in the sense that I just blend in with the world as just another person with friends and family and dreams and a life of their own. Just while sitting there watching TV I was actively worrying about the way I look or the things that I say because of his perception of me. I started to get caught in a loop of me doing literally anything (including sitting and breathing), and stopping and questioning  what I’m doing and whether it’s normal or whether I appear to blend in. 

That’s where it hit me. The nature of my depression and anxiety comes from this. The innate sense to feel normal around others. I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb to others. I feel like the things I do are weird and obvious. I hate my face, I hate my mannerisms, I hate my voice and I hate everything about myself. Seems harsh to finally say it “out loud” like this but it is what it is and I have to accept it eventually. I have plenty of self esteem but absolutely zero self worth. 

So where do we go from here? Well if you ask me a therapist, some antidepressants, and probably another stronger trip (or two, or three...) would be needed to tackle all of these feelings. All of that is fine but nothing changes the fact that I am who I am. I’m never going to be someone else and I’m always going to be stuck in my own body. It’s really hard to get over my hatred for myself when I’m stuck in here until I finally bleed from existence. Well if I can’t change that, I need to change things that I can.

My problem is that I don’t want to change myself just because of what other people think of me. I don’t want to beat myself down into a mold of what I think I should look and act like. But as much as it’s empowering to say “I am who I am and everyone who thinks I should change can suck it”, we do need to mold ourselves into a presentable and inviting appearance. Our social interactions are possibly the most important and significant interactions  have daily. Almost everything we do and say is broadcasted to the world for everyone to be aware of. And as much as we say what other people think of us doesn’t matter, it does. Putting myself in the shoes of another person passing me in the street or even my roommate sitting on his bed watching me take acid on a Wednesday night doesn’t look pretty. In someone else’s shoes I think I look uninviting and ugly, I think what I say and do is weird and thought of as strange, i think my life even looks a funny in a nihilistic sense. I feel as if I’m on display for the world to see like a zoo animal and everyone is sitting watching me judging every single thing I do. Especially my friends. I realized I don’t know what a real relationship should be like. I don’t know what friends are supposed to do and say, I don’t know what girlfriends/boyfriends are supposed to do and say, even people you meet in class. I have such a skewed and incomplete image of what a relationship is supposed to look like. And because of this I pack myself into a mold to fit the image of a relationship but end up failing greatly by failing to combine “own yourself” and “act normal” in appropriate quantities.

If anything I haven’t felt this worthless in a long time. The image of myself is clear, if not a little warped by my own mind. I feel like a hairy chunk of flesh and slime. 

Although this may seem like a bad experience from psychedelics (albeit an underwhelming one) it really wasn’t all so bad. It was introspective. It gave me a clearer picture of myself no matter how correct it is in my mind. It brought forward my problems with myself psychologically and personally that I need to address in the future. The high itself was good, other than the thought loop I was stuck in for a little while on the peak, that made me a bit nervous and started to beat down my senses while I got stuck in my mind. But that thought loop is what made me think about this.

I wish I could just trip and enjoy the world again instead of worrying about stupid shit.

Doubt anyone stuck around this long but if you did DM me. I’m always looking for new friends and well now you know more about my consciousness than my irl friends do. Peace ✌️ ",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajb5xb/introspection/

28498,Psychedelics,What should I expect going into first LSD experience,"First off I would like to point out I have only drank alcohol, and smoked weed. More recently started smoking more and found 2 other friends that were down to drop acid with me. I’ve recently gotten super into learning about drugs (DMT, LSD, Salvia,). I’m trying to get my mind ready for LSD as I’m pretty nervous about it. 

The main issue I think I will have with LSD is being able to “let go”, the first and second time I smoked weed I fought the feeling (got super anxious and hated the feeling of being high) but eventually learned how to enjoy it. I don’t want the same thing to happen with LSD and end up having a bad trip and scare the shit out of myself. 

I heard being high on LSD is like being higher then you’ve ever been which is a little worrying but then again I’m just a worrying person in general and overthink everything I do.  I’ve talked to my friend that has dropped lsd before and he thinks I’ll be perfectly fine which is very reassuring. 

I’m pretty sure if I’m going to drop I will start with 100ug as I’m not a very big guy and I feel that would be plenty to get me high... I’m 18yrs old 5’7  120-125 pounds (I’m skinny so my weight fluctuates)

I’m not going into LSD just trying to get high... I want answers, I want to come out of the experience learning more about myself and overall an improved person because I hear psychedelics can be life changing.

What should I know before going into my experience, and how do I learn to just LET GO and enjoy the experience and not freak the fuck out lol the last thing I want is to have a bad trip and scare the shit out of me away from psychedelics. I know bad trips can be the ones you learn from the most but I would like to just enjoy it.

I’m asking because I’ve seen quite a few posts on this sub regarding Xanax, blackouts, and doing really stupid shit while on it, and I don’t want to do that, just numb my brain and forget about anxiety for a while.

I’m aware that everybody’s different and that dosage depends on the person, but I guess what I’m asking is your personal experience. Should I be very cautious, eat beforehand/afterwards, smoke weed while I’m on it? Any tips are welcome.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajcn1r/how_much_xanax_is_too_much/

28514,Opioids,Electrolyte imbalance from using drugs?,"Hey! I was using Loperamide for opioid withdrawal 40-100 tablets every day for about a year. Then stopped taking it because I experienced chest pains when taking it with Kratom/Phenibut/DXM which didn't go away. So I stopped using everything, and only used Buprenorphine for 14 days after hospital visits showed nothing wrong with my heart, they tested everything! Then I went from bupe to kratom, now it's 130 hours approx since my last dose of buprenorphine/loperamide, taken a total of 3-4 doses of Loperamide in the last 4 weeks. Loperamide is a calcium channel blocker, and my chest pains started when I was tapering down on loperamide and/or combining them with the 3 other drugs I mentioned.

Now I'm only on Kratom and Phenibut. But I currenctly have palpitations and irregular heartbeat. This (but mostly the chest pains) used to worry me a lot, and came with a lot of anxiety, but after multiple visits from ambulances with EKG/and a thorough ER visit showed nothing wrong, I stopped caring about it all that much. I'm thinking perhaps my heavy Loperamide use caused some sort of calcium imbalance? It is a calcium channel blocker, chest pains often seem to worsen if I take for instance Gabapentin. Many drugs worsen it, but this might be psychological. The pains were much worse when I was combining Kratom+Loperamide, the pains is usually on the left side on the chest, and they can move all around the area, even towards the back (shoulder blades). And arm feels constricted sometimes, and my legs often feel inflamed.

Last 130 hours I have only taken Kratom, and it seems to trigger palpitations, irregular heartbeat. I also experience still sudden pains in my chest area, 95% of the time on the left side. Or a constant tightness, I think it might be spasms in arteries following abruptly stopping calcium channel blockers. Does anyone have an idea of what could be going on? I know I could go down to the doctors office to get bloodwork done, but I'm asking here first if anyone has knowledge regarding this.

When it kicked in i felt slight tingles slowly trickling down from my head to toes almost like a waterfall, i was a bit anxious for a good 30 mins after it kicked in however it slowley faded away and after that i just felt ""connected"" i guess you could call it. I felt i knew my friend who ive known for 2 years for 50 instead. And i finally came to understand what people are and what society is, now the visuals... They weren't too strong but i could definitely see that it was changing a bit, if i stared at the carpet for 30 seconds i could start to see little squares and other shapes forming into one another and such.

28564,LSD,"Went to the san luis valley, took acid, and had a sacred Spiritual experience","Summiting 800 foot sand dunes in the middle of a desert valley, facing snow peaked Mountains, feeling the energy of the geography below my feet. I remember summiting the dunes as my tabs kicked in, and being amazed at the sheer size of the valley. Time became completely irrelevant, I might as well have been in the wild west. I felt ancient. Running down the dunes I felt like I was flying, and was laughing uncontrollably the whole way down. We wander the desert, examining various rocks and crystals and desert plants lying in the desert. We make our way into the mountains and start hiking up. We see a sign that informs us we are now in untouched wilderness. We start thinking about our survival, carefully planning every move . Once the sun goes down, the temperature drops rapidly, and if we got lost without food , or warm blankets etc, we would be completely fucked. So we decide to climb up the mountain side, that's covered with various cactus types we could fall on. Until we reach a relatively flat Rock to sit on. We sit there, smoke a cigar, watch the sun set over the dunes and desert. All around me, snow, mixed with insane geography, and arid plants, watching the sky turn into a mysterious light show, like God was trying to show me something. Strange lights on the horizon turn out to be small town lights, turning on as the sun goes down. Temperature goes from probably 40 degrees to probably -10 extremely fast. We begin to hike down and we hear mysterious footsteps following us from the woods. Hoping it's not a bear breifly out of hibernation, we continue down the mountain, through the massive Aspen trees and frozen creeks, back into the Sandy desert floor. doing our best to avoid park rangers, we head  back to our car, spark a joint, turn up the music, and hit the long, londsome desert road, back to higher elevation, back into the snowy, desolate Rockies, to my apartment, where Everytime I close my eyes, the only thing I can see is the valley, calling me back. There are legends that date back to the native Americans that took spiritual journeys there (land is too harsh to really survive off of) there are tales of humanoid ant like creatures that live in tunnels, tales of mysterious creatures that have chased people in cars then dissapeared, and also there have been hundreds of reports of mysterious cow and horse mutalations since the 1960s and hundreds of UFO sightings. The valley is filled with geothermal water, and underneath the land is miles of crystals and shit like that. And when you're there, you can feel all of the energy. There is something very mysterious there, and it is a place that will forever be sacred grounds to me.

I know this is temporary, however these emotions can help me reflect and exaggerate a bit on the good thoughts and expectation I have about my present and future.

28650,Cannabis,Quick story about the time I smoked weed the day after surgery on my collarbone (DO NOT RECOMMEND),"Last year I went skiing with some family and long story short I broke my collarbone and needed surgery to set it back in place, as it was a complete break. They put bolts into my collarbone, which are still there to this day. You can even feel them if you touch my scar.

ANYWAY,

After surgery I was chilling in my room in a moderate amount of pain. I was even on opiates, but they were pretty weak and had tylenol so I couldn't just take a bunch unfortunately. 

I decide to smoke a bowl to try and alleviate some of the pain. First of all grinding weed and packing a bowl only using one arm is quite difficult and any slight movements would hurt my shoulder. 

Eventually I finally smoke the bowl and am chilling on my couch watching Netflix when my shoulder just starts exploding with pain. I remember thinking it hurt worse than when I originally broke it (and that was the worst pain in my life)

It was an excruciating burning pain right where my surgery was. The pain was so bad that i thought i fucked up the stitches or something was fucked internally where they put the bolts in. 

I remember just laying on the couch promising I would never smoke again, swearing  off weed forever, and still contemplating if I needed to call my dad to take me back the hospital.

Eventually the pain faded, maybe it was 30minutes, maybe it was an hour. 

So yeah, if you get surgery definitely wait a bit before smoking the ganj.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajeykf/quick_story_about_the_time_i_smoked_weed_the_day/

28953,Cannabinoids,Had a panic attack from weed recently and need advice if to quit,"Started smoking weed recently and have been a very vocal supporter of legalizing it in my country in the Caribbean. Last week I fell in work and hit my chest, took ibuprofen 12 noon and then at 7 in the night I smoked a small piece of weed very small the same one I smoked the day prior and was heaven. Then just like that after 7 minutes I smoked another TINY piece to increase the high, this was very high grade kush BTW.

Prior to smoking I was remembering an article I read about how weed causes psychosis and I was worried I might be trapped forever in a weed high or a alternate reality. But same time I tried to forget it but couldn't shake the feeling it might happen. Anyways like everytime I smoked weed and was heaven I thought this time would be the same.

Then 10 minutes later while eating salty french fries and smoking weed same time a few minutes after eating I got a panic attack, I heard a wolf barking and clawing at my brain. I felt dizzy when I sat down and moved my head left to right in anyway, my heart beat was fine only 60bpm but my pressure spiked 160/110 and I then felt like I was getting a heart attack my heart was going to explode and that was all I could think off, my moth was DRY extremely dry like you wouldn't believe and no amount of water would help, I accept my death there, I went outside and tossed out all the weed into the drain and accepted my death. I felt like I was doomed like a person on Cocaine who is mad. I saw a mad man that same day prior to smoking, he was a vagrant talking to himself due to cocaine use most likely.

&amp;#x200B;

Went to sleep and woke up and all was fine next day. Some people suggested the painkiller pill I took caused it others said my mindset caused it others said it happens once to people and I will be fine others said the weed might have been too high grade too much THC and not enough CBD.

&amp;#x200B;

I am terrified to smoke weed again but I miss it so much. I suffer from both Diabetes and high blood pressure, and in the past I once had an episode where I got a major hypertension crisis. It was then the doctor diagnosed me with hypertension I am obese and I am wondering if losing weight would allow me to smoke weed once more

or getting the local Caribbean weed with equal CBD and THC would help? the thing is high blood pressure can cause blindness and the weed can and does cause it panic attack which results in temporary spike in serious pressure.

29024,Sertraline,Is smoking weed while on Zoloft a bad idea?,"I've been feeling a lot better thanks to Zoloft. Life is going good and I feel comfortable and somewhat happy at times. I still have a lot of issues I need to work on which is why I go to therapy every two weeks. I sometimes think I should go once a week but I don't know.

I'm also on mirtazapine and risperidone.

Is there anything wrong with smoking weed every week?

I'm not using it to cope or anything. I just use it because it is fun and relaxing. I just like to smoke and paint on canvases and listen to music. I know how easy it is to be addicted to it.

I don't smoke every single second and every single day. I mostly just smoke late at night and chill.

My therapist said that it can increase anxiety and depression.

All my friends think I'm fine and it's not a big deal I smoke.

But ganja these days is very powerful. And I sometimes worry about what it's doing to my brain.

I've been smoking the past 4 weeks and haven't had any issues. A few bad trips here and there when I got too high, but still, it was all very enjoyable.

My psychiatrist was telling me how it's dangerous because I'm buying it from the streets. And that it could be laced and I might end up in the emergency room. I've been smoking for the past 2 years at age 24 and never had anything laced or anything like that.

I know smoking weed isn't a great habit. And it's not really the greatest thing to be doing, but I just like to chill and draw in my sketchbook and listen to some music. Is that such a bad thing?

Anyway this was back on Halloween, I've just thought to ask on here about it and I'm curious if anyone has had a similar experience.
Myself and 3 friends were at this Halloween party at a club in Leeds. Had a 'Microsoft' which went down well and I had a really nice chilled thing going on. Went to the bar to get a drink and started chatting to this girl in a sombrero who asked me if she could get me a drink. I said it's OK because I was getting a round for my friends. Anyway she said OK have a good night and walked off.
I don't know if it had something to do with the fact that I was getting married in the November but all I could think about for at least two weeks after was that this girl had the most amazing eyes. I swear to god I thought it fallen in love with this girl I'd spent 30 seconds with at the bar. I was genuinely worried she would still be in my head at my wedding (thankfully she wasn't).

29083,Cannabinoids,I figured out the best way to combine weed and adderall,"So I'm high as fuck and I wanted to share my experience of how I learned the best way to combine adderall and weed without getting really bad anxiety and paranoia. 

So I am prescribed adderall to take everyday. I take it in the morning before I take any other drugs besides nicotine and caffeine. Then later I take dab pen rips either at school or on the bus. At that point the adderall has already taken effect and almost every single time I've done it this way I get really bad anxiety and just a general 'trippy' kind of feeling.

Then one time I hit my dab pen before I took any adderall and I ended up not getting the anxious and trippy headspace that I usually would get. I tried repeating this a few times to see if the order affected how anxious I would get and it did drastically.

Almost every single time that I took dab pen rips first then took adderall I got noticeable anxiety reduction whereas if I took adderall then dab rips I would get a very noticeable increase in anxiety.

So basically if you are going to combine weed and adderall I would suggest taking the adderall either immediately before or after smoking or vaping the weed or concentrate. I think this is because if you smoke/vape awhile after you've taken the adderall the peaks of the two drugs are more likely to overlap, creating a more intense and anxious high.

Guess what. Fuck it.  If it feels good, why hold yourself back? So long story short. I got really fucked up with 2 other buddies. They’re straight I’m straight. And we actually didn’t do anything. But! They forced me to come to a realization that I’m curious. 

Convo came up cuz we were tripping and I was sweating a bit so I took my shirt off. My (up until this point, engaged, never made any hints of being gay) friend goes dude, you’re kinda fuckin hot. I wasn’t offended because my look( thin but muscular ish, blonde, smaller frame, and I’m an outgoing dude) so I get hit on and asked if I’m gay a a lot) 


I’ve always been a little curious,, not really opposed to try certain things like a devils three way, or if a girl wanted to try butt shit, I’d give it a thought. But being as everyone always thought I was gay, I figured fuck it. (Well these guys helped me come to terms that trying shit isn’t gay. Liking it isn’t gay. Have feelings for a guy is gay. And that’s totally fuckin fine! But, I’m not gay. Just kinky as all fuck. If my girl wants to see a dude suck my dick. Go for it bro. If that gets her wet, I’m down. (Plus other shit but I know my limits, they do expand when I get fucked up but u get the gist) This used to be a real insecurity of mine because I questioned my sexuality and the fact that I was curious confused me a bit. 

I know I’m a good looking dude but I have a lot of insecurity and I find myself doubting myself a lot. But fuck that.  I’m a good looking dude. I have guys hounding me. Chicks hounding me. A girlfriend right now who loves my dick. I 
don’t have anything to be insecure about. 


So last night I get home, and I’m just horny. I’m feeling myself. And I’m like, hey, you’ve been trying to get me to open up more, let’s fuckin play. 

She wanted to see me suck a dick. Thatd be hot to her. I don’t think I’m at a point where that would turn me on. But, I’m flexible. I’m drunk. I got a decent sized dick and I’m positive I could reach. 

So my gf and I watched a video.  We set up like he did. And I got my own dick like 4 inches in my mouth while my gf sucked my balls, at my ass.

Yeah. We started there. (After some obvious foreplay) so..


TL;DR: TRY EVERY FUCKING SEXUAL THING YOU CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF AND A GIRL YOU TRUST IN THE MIX MAKES GAY SHIT A LOT LESS GAY.

29250,Dissociatives,K-hole for newbies - The Space Worm.,"I know a lot of people are curious as to what a K-hole feels like. Maybe you're an upcoming adventurer that's looking into Ketamine, collecting and researching every bit of information about the substance before actually trying it. 

If you are, you're a lot like me. And I'm here to contribute to your research.

When I was researching Ketamine, one of the most common terms used in reports was the term *K-hole*. So when I wanted to learn more about it, I was greeted with various personal stories that always seemed to vary quite a lot.

So let me make one point very clear.

Every story and report you've read about Ketamine(or any other substance for that matter) is a very *very* personal and unique experience. You are reading this because you want to prepare yourself and you want to have certain expectations. But the truth is, nothing can fully prepare you for your own unique experience, because *you're* the one that has to go trough it. 

If it makes you feel any better there IS one thing that I've found every story shares. And that's the Falling sensation. And even that varies into spinning, twisting or whirling.

Enough with the ramble. So what *DOES* a K-hole feel like?

note: Every experience I had was with me laying down in a comfortable position with headphones on, listening to music.


The first thing I notice is an unbelievable relaxing sensation throughout my body. I have melted. I am one with the bed. I become lightheaded, which transcends into my headspace exploding  and filling out the room. My mind, in it's newly found expanding environment, begins to wander.

Music fills out the room. And has control of the experience. Not directly. But I've noticed that the excitement from certain song parts affects my mood and it's the mood that controls the experience. My mood controls the imagery, colours and the story of my experience.

note: Whatever I see, feel or experience, I go trough it having a clear mind. My mind is not dazed. I have full control of my thoughts and awareness. 

I'm in a dark space and I start falling.

It's not a physical feeling, but rather a visual one. With my surrounding being this black space I notice little white line fractals falling down. They form a circular shape as they fall from the black sky, and when looked at from a 3 dimensional perspective they resemble a tube of sorts. And yes. You have no problems observing things from whichever perspective you want in this place.

After I notice the failing sensation the K-hole experience truly begins. I like to describe it as a story. A movie of sorts. One man ticket for the most unique ride of your life. Imagine it like a rollercoaster ride, only slow.

Or better yet.. (and please exercise your imagination for this part)

Imagine you're an enormous worm. And you're wiggling about throughout space. You have one all seeing eye at your front side.  As you wiggle trough the black space you see imagery, moving objects, letters, and memories. Whichever come first to your relaxed mind. It's those imagery, memories and imagination that form your ride. This story you're experiencing. 

As you wiggle trough your imagination, you leave a memory trail, like a snail leaves it's slimy trail only yours is enormous(Remember, you're a huge worm) and tube shaped. 

note: For those still having trouble imagining themselves as an enormous worm, I'm talking 50 meters in diameter and a kilometar long.

And as you leave your trail of memories, you can look back at it and see it. You may even decide to halt the worm, stop in your tracks and implode in yourself, revisiting these moments of imagery and memories. 

The space isn't always black. Colours are controlled by my mood influenced by music. They can turn to any colour. But mostly it's a red or yellow hue, or sometimes absolute black. 

As for the imagery and memories. They are entirely unique. Whatever comes to mind I can manifest in front of me. My imagination is the limit.

29254,LSD,Forgot that I took acid,"Over all the years I’ve been taking drugs and acid specifically I’ve always wondered what would happen if I fell asleep after taking acid and woke up tripping or somehow forgot that I took acid and wondered what would happen. 

Last night my girlfriend and I had decided we wanted to trip because we both had the next day off work. After we at dinner and were going to drop she suggested we don’t take any acid as she wasn’t in the right mindset. When she suggests this I told her that it was fine and that I was going to just take a Xanax and chill.

Fast forward one Xanax bar and a few to many beers later I enter the auto-pilot like state we all have come to know. And there you have it, I come to and realize I’m tripping balls.

The rest of the night was a very dream like trip, fairly heavy visuals and very heavy body load. And not to mention later on in the night I found myself smoking an unknown amount of DMT and had one of the craziest trips of my life.

29294,Long Post,First LSD Trip Report,"Do we post reports here? if not lemme know...

This is the report of my first trip ever, happened Jan 2nd 2019 (way to start the year, lol)  


Had been holding on to the stuff for nearly a month waiting for my visiti g family to return home so I'd have a chance. On the same day they left is when I did it. I was by myself in my room and just tremendously curious of what it was like. I weigh 220 lb 6'3 (for whatever its worth)  


2:00 pm - Put 450 ug (9 x 50 ug tabs) worth in a small vial with some vodka so it'd dilute, since I didn't want to hold the paper in my mouth (unconformable maybe? Dunno why I did it this way) . Not a significant amount of alcohol at all.  


9:00 pm - Here we go, drank a bit more then half, though did not ingest any of the paper, so must've been between 200 and 250 ug. Thought I was gonna trip and maybe go to sleep at 12:00 am or 1:00 am and maybe have some crazy dreams too (boy was I wrong...). Headed to the [tripsit.me](http://tripsit.me/) website and just chilled with the dudes.  


9:45pm - nothing... started to suspect it was a dud... but held on  


10:00 pm - Startet to fell the coldness in my bones, you know, like the feel when you just wake up in a frosty morning and you are all cozy under the comforter. Also started having my first visuals, saw the corner of my book shelf start to wobble and the textures on my ceiling got super crisp and kind of 3-D ish.  


10:30 pm - Everything was moving and bright, visuals were crazy, a bit of nausea but nothing much.  


11 ish, no clue at this point - Visuals extremely intense, every texture had geometric patterns and colors that kept on shifting. I went to the restroom and saw myself in the mirror.... Dude, I looked myself deep in the eyes and started wondering ""who am I?""  
Its not like I forgot who I was, I was wondering ""what makes me, me"" what defines the ""I"".  
I think I stood there and discussed this with myself for about 45 minutes, always laughing at my dancing chest hairs and insane tracers from my hand (even recorded myself, haven't watched it yet out of shame, lol).  


11:00 pm ish + 45 mins-ish - Came out of my bathroom and saw my whiteboard... I had to record all of my thoughts before they were gone forever! (\[Image\]([https://imgur.com/a/ahCGs8U](https://imgur.com/a/ahCGs8U)))  


Fuck if I know the time now - Decided to watch porn... disgusting! I could feel the ugliness and lack of love or passion on it! Decided to draw a bath and use my imagination and memories... dude... its hard to describe... it was extremely fucking beautiful! The scenes in my head were not erotic or anything like that, but I could feel a pleasure like no other, it was like I was masturbating to nature itself and mathematical fractals were giving me a hardon. The concept that kept coming to my mind was ""its like a religion is being formed around my penis"" (for whatever reason). Fractal castles emerged and symbolized my journey to achieve orgasm (took a long while, not easy). It was one of the most intense orgasms in my life!  
Just laid there for a few minutes appreciating the perfect square tiling in my restroom wall.  


Midnight or so maybe - After sharing my stuff with the people at [tripsit.me](https://tripsit.me) (I was typing like mad, no issues at all there, big surprise to me), they recommended me some websites to visit, among a few cute ones, the one that blew me away was the one with the 3D environment where a music video happens and such. After that I turned on some music, closed my eyes, and just let myself feel things. so fucking beautiful (Pink Floyd, obviously, what else?)

&amp;#x200B;

Guessing around 2:00 am - Decided to turn on my UV lights and lay down and relax... looked at my ceiling, and dude... trees were coming down from the patterns... THERE WERE TREES COMING DOWN FROM MY CEILING!!!! They were still very fractal-like and geometric, but white trees nonetheless.  
At this point I just laid there sometimes with eyes opened looking at the ceiling trees and sometimes closing my eyes and going places in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Ofc I never got to sleep, still had mild visuals after this until 6:00 am or 8:00 am when I had to interact with my roommate.  


Conclusions: Had a blast, definitely doing it again at some point, maybe shrooms? And definitely out in the open, or with people, but I'm very happy with what I had as a first experience (haven't tripped since, tried the rest of the vodka a week later but only had mild visuals, guessing the tolerance was higher than I though).

During the trip I could really see how the trip could go badly, I think I was still sober enough to steer my thoughts away from dark areas and all, but I really think I was on the edge of losing control there. Like a sailor on a storm or something. Very interesting, wonder what would happen if I couldn't steer...  


Deep thoughts:  
While discussing with myself I realized a lot about mind body and soul, and how awareness gives rise to the ""self"", its not ""I think therefore I am"" its ""I'm aware therefore I am"", without an environment or body to be aware of, you aren't. The body is what gives the mind the sense of self and existence, the soul is what's left without it... or something along those lines, lol.  
I'm completely skeptical on this stuff and don't think any of the stuff I though while in that state actually has any credibility to it, its just funny and interesting ideas that come up with no objective reality behind them, but interesting nonetheless. I don't consider psychedelics to be a ""gateway"" to any truths and all we experience is 100% subjective and not related to how the world works (boy am I gonna get some hate for saying this stuff here xD).  
But that is just my own perception of my trip, of course I don't know shit about the universe since I'm a mere human speckle in an indifferent universe. (Also a conclusion I've reached shortly after my trip. Not giving much credit to the things I think about while on this state since in the end it's just chemicals interfering with synapses)

29315,DXM + DPH,"The ""right way"" to do DXM + DPH combo, from an experienced user","PLEASE MAKE SURE TO CHECK EITHER (OR BOTH) PSYCHONAUTS WIKI AND EROWID'S VAULT BEFORE EVEN CONSIDERING USING THESE DRUGS, THANK YOU, LOVE YOU, PEACE. THIS WAS WRITTENG FOR SOMEWHAT EXPERIENCED DRUG USERS SO SOME STUFF WAS SKIPPED, IF YOU HAVE DOUBTS GOOGLE AND ASK, DON'T BE DUMB.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so a few days ago I wrote a post about taking DPH more safely, and I mentioned I was going to writte a ""DXM + DPH"" combo post as it is one of the 'safest' (less dangerous) ways of taking DPH as you need a much lower dose.

&amp;#x200B;

The combo of course has some other good aspects worth exploring if these drugs are kind of 'your thing'... but before I get to what to expect and how to do it safely, let me copy something from the DPH post that also applies here:

&amp;#x200B;

"" I know that this post will cause a lot of controversy here, I know a lot of people won't like it and some even may hate it.

To those of you who dislike deliriants or dph, I must clarify that the purpose of this post IS NOT TO PROMOTE DPH, but aimed to help those who do this drug to at least follow a ""less dangerous and healthier path"". So I respectfully ask you to avoid negative and not constructive comments. Of course constructive argumen is totaly welcome.""

&amp;#x200B;

What was stated above applies to DXM too, I just want to share some info about it... but let it be clear that everyone is responsable for their own drug use and know that both of these drugs are dangerous and a somewhat neurotoxic.

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT TO EXPECT AND DOSAGE

&amp;#x200B;

Of course no one should jump right into this combo if they have not tried both drugs alone, or at least DXM alone (in my opinion) as they tend to boost each other and the trip can be overwhelming for unexperienced users, so start low and know what you are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

The high is somewhat different to an either DPH or DXM high on their own, I would describe it as a ""DXM body and DPH mind"" sort of thing, of course depending on the individual dose of each, the higher you go with the DXM the more dissociated you will be and the higher you go with the DPH the more delirious it will feel. THE SAME INDIVIDUAL DOSE WILL TAKE YOU DEEPER INTO THE ABYSM WITH THIS COMBO, so be careful.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing is they cancel each other's unpleasant effects out, you get rid of the DPH body load and the ""fear"" as you also relieve the DXM's nausea and itching. The DPH will add great music euphoria to the already orgasmic music euphoria of DXM, it will substancially increase the body load (in a pleasant-ish way) and of course enough DPH will give you amazing HYPER real open eyed visuals.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to explain two very important things, first of all if you manage to get the DPH high enough to hallucinate, but not high enough to be delirious, you will have amazing DPH visuals but you will realize that you are hallucinating so the experience is not as confusing and can actually be euphoric and fun. Tho if you go high enough, you will certanly get delirious (not being able to tell that you are hallucinating, reality and hallucinations blend in together).

&amp;#x200B;

And the other thing is, a lot of people recommend taking the DPH 30-45 mins prior taking the DXM but... THIS IS FOR BOOSTING THE DXM EXPERIENCE, USELESS FOR THE COMBO. In my experience dosing 45 mins before taking the DXM will actually decrease the visuals I get (if I get any) so this is not a very good idea. What you need to do is (and you should thank me for this because this is the absolute key) TAKE THE DPH 20 MINS BEFORE THE DXM PEAKS, so it goes like this: You take the DXM, you wait till you feel the effects, when you feel like the come up is about to end take the DPH, 20 mins later you are seeing angels flying in your room with lights on, YOU ARE WELCOME.

&amp;#x200B;

I would usually recommend not going over 500 mgs of dph (mainly because it begins to be extra toxic) and also because you can get pretty decent hallucinations at doses as low as 300 mgs, and I would also recommend taking a 1:2 DPH and DXM ratio with MAX 700 mg of DXM (unless that's too much DXM for you, OBV DON'T TAKE 500 MG DPH AND 1000 MG DXM OR YOU MAY DIE). But examples of acceptable doses are listed bellow:

\- 150 mg dph/300 mg dxm: This will mostly boost the DXM and maybe add slight visual hallucinations and music euphoria.

\- 200 to 250 mg dph/400 mg dxm: This is usually where the visuals begin to take ""true form"" if one's got a low tolerance (ideal), not very intense but you won't be disapointed. Good for first timers, if experienced and brave.

\- 300 mg dph/300 mg dxm: The infamous 300/300, it is a ""classic"" if you've tried this before and didn't have good results try taking the dph 20 mins before the dxm peak this time. Good for first timers, if experienced and brave.

\- 300 mg dph/600 mg dxm: This should be potent, not recommended for first timers. Try watching static pictures, THEY MOVE. Equivalent DPH dose alone: 600 - 700 mg.

\- 450 mg dph/600 - 700 mg dxm: This will be very potent, be very careful as you may get delirous. Turn the lights ON or you may fall asleep. Equivalent DPH dose alone: 800 mg+ MUST HAVE A TRIP SITTER.

&amp;#x200B;

I would say that once you are confortable with the combo play around the 300 - 450 mg of dph dose range to find your sweet spot, don't do it too often as tolerance builds really fast and RUINS it. This is not something you should be doing on a regular basis unless you want to destroy your brain, I personally only do it like two or three times a year.

&amp;#x200B;

REAL DANGERS

&amp;#x200B;

All of the DPH dangers apply to this combo so I recommend you to go an check my other post about DPH but to sumarize. It will hurt your brain, it will leave you mentally fogged for about 5 - 10 days (depending on dose). You can do stupid shit while being delirious and hurt yourself so make sure you have a sitter if you don't know what you are doing.

&amp;#x200B;

The combo can be somewhat addictive because it is really fun to some people, so moderation is key. Keep in mind that if you over do it you will ruin it, the more mgs you take of each drug the more damage you do to your brain (and it increases the risk of heart failure during the trip, doses higher than the recommended are pretty dangerous for that matter).

&amp;#x200B;

You may fall asleep easily, vomit and maybe choke on it so make sure you have a sitter or fall asleep in a safe position (at least). NEVER GO OUTSIDE, NEVER DRIVE, be careful with your surroundings as you may fall down.

&amp;#x200B;

TURN YOUR PHONE OFF unless you want to find that you typed your mother ""oasdiojaiwjdioawjdiojw jaisjdiawjdioawhdioah"" and other 100 lines of complete random letters no matter what she said back (an you will think that you wrote proper sentences, in the moment you literally believe you are typing with all sense and logic but you are DELIRIOUS).

&amp;#x200B;

A last copy + paste from the DPH post to finish here:

""PREPARE THE TRIP AREA, NOTHING DANGEROUS, ,NOTHING THAT CAN BE CONFUSED AS FOOD OR DRINK BUT IT'S ACTUALLY SOAP OR SOMETHING. TRY TO SET A NICE PLACE AND ALWAYS HAVE A TRIPSITTER OR YOU CAN LITERALLY KILL YOURSELF.

Probably last thing as this is already getting too long. I once had a horrible experience that gone too far and all thanks to the delirium, if you want the details check the post but basically I only wanted to redose 100 mgs, but once I did it, it would just not get registered in my memory so I would think I have not redoses, so redose los 100 I wanted and then forget and do it again multiple times till I was done with the blister and it certanly got over the +1000 mg and it was awful. IT IS VERY HARD TO ""REDOSE"" AND MANAGE DRUGS WHILE YOU ARE ON DPH, SO BE SURE TO TAKE EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO TAKE AT ONCE AND THEN HIDE YOUR LEFTOVERS IN A SAFE PLACE (OR MAKE THE TRIPSITTER DO IT).

YOU CAN EASILY TAKE THE WRONG DOSE OF ANY DRUG OR EVEN NOT IDENTIFY WHAT YOU ARE TAKING. YOU CAN OVERDOSE OR END UP TAKING THE WRONG DRUG OR SOMETHIN TOXIC BY ACCIDENT.""

I hope this post helps, if you gor any question please ask, and remember you only have one brain, dont risk it.

29396,Opioids,My Opium experience in India,"I was In India for a wedding, specifically the state of Punjab. My driver there is a avid user and was talking about some opium and how it helps him relax at night rather then drinking booze, opium is called aFeem there. I asked for some and I offered some cash but he refused and gave it to me on the house, what a nice guy.

If any of you don’t know what opium is, it’s the form of latex that is extracted from the Papaver somniferum, also known as opium poppy. It contains psychoactive metabolites such as morphine, codeine and thebaine. 

He gave me piece of brownish glob, i felt the squishy brown booger looking substance between my two fingers and drop it on my tongue, tasted really earthy and a little bitter but I enjoyed the taste, downed it and an hour and half later not a rush like you get with painkillers, I’m more familiar with snorting blue roxis, percs, and hydros and compared to that this is a lot more body heavy high and my body felt really euphoric, my muscles felt heavy and tingly, the mental stimulation was mild but intense enough. I felt energized.

It kinda reminded me the first time of smoking weed, as I was walking to my cousins I felt like I was floating in a dream state. I smelt this distinct smell that reminded me of my childhood summers here and made me nostalgic and made the high even more euphoric. My driver and I talked for more then we have in our entire lives to each other and I’ve known this guy for 6-7 years lol.

I could control the feeling of me nodding out if any of you know what I mean. I came home later in bed turned on some music and layer back with dim lights and had such pleasurable and vivid dreams, and at any time I could wake up, and was fully coherent. This is a great substance, glad I’ve had the pleasure of trying and removing it off my bucket list. I’m glad this isn’t readily available here because it’s so nice, sure prescription pills are nice but the reason I don’t get addicted to it is because of how potent and sedating they are.

29423,Cannabis,A bit paranoid after smoking hash the second time. Can’t find anything on Google need help.,"So this subject isn’t my strongest, I’ve smoked weed once and hash twice so I’m kinda new to this.

The first time I smoked hash it was kinda dry and not so good quality but I still got high as it was my first time so it still really felt. But the second time I smoked was with two friends like 2 days ago and it was one of them who got it for us and it was wet and good quality (even I could see that)

The thing is that I might just be paranoid but it was kind of scary and I wonder if it could have been something wrong with it or that I had bad side effects. After we shared it and was chilling, eating and listening to music it hit me like a rock. I wasn’t ready at all and I had a hard time to even get out full sentences. And my two friends didn’t have a hard time at all but they smoke almost Every day for a few years now.

So what really scared me was that after a while my legs started moving by them self, and this might sound fucking weird but they moved in rythm and I could not do anything. Both legs went *right, left, the up* but only a few centimeters, this was going on for about 15 min then it was over and I was just feeling good.

Can this side effect be dangerous or is it just one of million things that can happen?

29439,Stimulants,From 0 too Psychosis real swift,"So Keep in mind this was the first binge after 6 months of complete sobriety. By far the most mind fucking experience ive had so ill just get right too it . So here i am cuddling on the couch with my drunk boyfriend im babbling my ass off high as shit but still  completly sane at this point then his paraplegic friend went to put on a movie thats the exact moment my mind started leaving reality. I thought buddy put a hidden camera in the dvd player it was dark and all the items in the room started looking like sexual torture devices so i gradually came to the conclusion that they were actors all part of this dark web cult trying to film a live sexual escape room game show and i was the main contestant finally 
I start crying and accusing these poor bastards and of course they were shocked and denying all of it but i was convinced they were being payed to stay in character so i run out of the house its dark and my boyfriend tried to get me to come back but i keeped running until he gave  up. As i look around i realize im on one giant movie set and i have find clues to escape or they kill me and the whole things filmed and watched by a live audience. so i accept my fate and decide to act like a total iggnorant sarcatic asshole talking out loud as shadow people are following me down the road i made it pretty far then sat on the road so fucking scared but also pretty impressed by how much work they put into making the ""movie set"" look like a  real place.  Somehow my boyfriends buddy finds me and i hop on his lap riding his electric wheelchair being a maniac trying to crash it. We get back to the apartment and i stripped completely naked and told them to hurry up and fuck me so my boyfriend (in real life) started fucking me and eating me out while his friend watched. I changed my mind and ran around the apartment still naked trying to find the clues too escape which led to me running back out on the streets totally naked for probably 3 hours or more i was wandering around peoples yards/decks babbling on talking to the audience begging them for hints or to let me inside to warm up. It was starting to get light out as im doing a scavenger hunt on some guys deck when i see him in the door window and start knocking and telling him to let me in and fuck me thinking that would be the next step to escape he just stared at me while talking on the phone. Turns out he called the cops whom already know me well. 2 cops pull up on my twacked out naked ass and i just think there in on the whole thing so im mouthing off in the back of the cop car laughing dancing and trying to convince the cop to smoke a fat bowl with me and let me teach him how to 10 and 2. So next im in the holding cell/drunk tank saw the surveillance camera and decided to make a music video about meth so i go all out doing some over the top dance moves/parkour splashing water on the floor and rolling in it all while singing about meth. Eventually i woke up on the floor with the painters suit they gave me wrapped around me like a fucked up toga dress and i had never been so fucking confused in my life but had come back to reality just enough to get released.

29484,Cannabinoids,"Laced weed, does this sound like synthetic cannabis?","Ok so I’ve had a fucked up experience 3 years ago that I’ve always dwindled on. Maybe you guys have some theories that would help out.

The story goes:

So I haven’t smoked up in a few days and decide to link up with my smoke buddies to wind of for the night. I go to my mates house who we typically kick back at and waited for the rest of the boys to show up. So a short while passes and 3 of my boys rock up, and they’re excited as fuck. Apparently our mate Johnny has managed to get some of the strongest weed they’ve ever tried and they’re keen on having me try it.

So I got just as excited, rolled a blunt real quick and headed straight to Johnny’s with the rest of the boys. When we get there, Johnny tells me that there isn’t much left of it so we’ll be hitting bongs out of it so there’s enough to go around. Nothing unusual here so I’m down with that. They decide to let me have the first hit since they’ve all already tried this strain except me. My mate packs me a bowl, I tell him to pack it even more cause fuck it, why not? 

Right after hitting that bong, as I was trying to put the bond down, everything just felt different. Nothing was making sense anymore. Within a split second the world I was in ceased to exist. Perception of time was lost. I forgot who I was, what I was, where I was. In my head, outside of the room we were in, nothing existed. All my mates looked half real half animated and were speaking an incoherent language.

Before this experience I had never tried psychedelics, but over the years I ended up getting into them. I can say that the experience can be described as psychedelic, but I’ve never found myself in such a state from any psychedelic.

Now the worst part is my mate took a video of me to show me afterwards. This part made me want to cry. I literarily looked like someone who had lost their mind. I was wide eyed, happy and smiling. And for the 15 minutes it lasted I was attempting to communicate with my mates in a made up language while simultaneously shooting these “invisible” things in the air with my hand, pretending it was a gun and making laser bullet noises.

Safe to say I’ve cut those mate out of my life, but that experience is quite something. No me told me what was laced with the weed until a couple year own the road when I was informed it was synthetic. I came to the assumption that it might have been Sylvia.

Pretty standard addiction sorry here, feel free to skip to paragraph 2.  I came out to my entire to my entire family and circle of friends the day after my father died. My father was a very wealthy man and didn't have to work so he built a apartment size guest house for me to live in rent free so I could get the groceries and typical cleaning things as he had one leg amputated two years, earlier. This arrangement worked out amazingly for over a year. We got extremely close to the point where we told each other secrets we had never spoken of before. 

As we were waiting on a stopping train, my father began his usual shuffle through his reusable Publix bag affectionately called his purse. Now, at this point in my life I had smoked quite a large amount of weed, tried Xanax, molly and even designer shit like bath salts. Never felt like it was that great. Well my father pulled out a bottle of oxycontin 40 mg extended release pills and asked if I wanted one for now and one for later. I told him I had never had that high of a dose before and he assured me the extension release would make it last longer for me. So I took it. The next approx 6 hours of my life were absolutely perfect. Everything was amazing and good, and I loved every minute of it. Gradually he started sharing his blue 30mg instant release pills and I would cut them in half and swallow them till I realized snotting was much more effective. From then on I was not only living with the person I loved more than anything, but this was the person who was helping me destroy my life. 

There is a happy ending if you made it this far. My father passed away on October 1, 2017. I found him and he had obviously overdose on the blue oxy thirties we had enjoyed so much. He was in poor health already so I cleaned up the illegal pills and his them while I called 911. They arrived and assumed he died of natural causes. After they left with his body I counted the pills I has.taiwn and there were over 200 of them at $30-25 each. Being the weak dumb ass I am, I took as many as I could non stop until I ran out completely in only 4 days. I survived the worst withdrawal of my entire life and I haven't touched opiates since.

29545,Deliriants,DPH Trip Story,"Long post, tldr at the bottom

So  this is the story of most of what happened the last time I tripped on  Benadryl. For anyone who doesn't know, Diphenhydramine or DPH, is an  active ingredient in Benadryl and other similar over the counter  medication. DPH in higher than recommended doses can cause a high and or  hallucinations as it is a deliriant. The effects of DPH are better  explained [here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine).

Anyways here's the actual story:

So  around 10pm I took 24 Benadryl with 25mg of DPH per pill totalling  600mg of DPH. When it began to kick in I was sitting in my bed feeling  extremely tired as Benadryl is used as a sleep aid. I began to see some  lines in my vision and some other geometric shapes. As I was looking at  my bed a spider about the size of a quarter seemed to materialize out of  my blanket and walk across it. Hallucinations are intensified with the  absence of light so I shined my phone flashlight directly on the spider  and it disappeared. I killed? I guess? about 6 or 7 spiders during the  night. Sometimes I'd see a normal object like my phone or a pen on my  blanket. When I'd go to grab them my hand would go right through them.  At about 6:30 the next morning I felt pretty sober as everything had  calmed down and worn off, I thought. One of my friends texted me to say  he was coming over, I said sure that's fine see you soon. I got to the  door to the garage and two of my friends were standing there. I said hi  to my dad and mentioned that they would be here and we went to my room.  One of my friends disappeared or left at some point along the way and it  was just me and we'll call him John in my room. I pulled an envelope  out of somewhere, I still don't remember where and opened it up. Two  pieces of paper and two bags were inside. Between the two bags was a  strip of acid and the two pieces of paper were perforated and appeared  to be two sheets of acid. I was pretty happy. My friend told me my shoe  was untied so I looked away to tie it, he grabbed the two bags and ran, I  saw a car through my window but by the time I got outside they were  gone. I texted him immediately, he didn't reply, I called a few times  and he answered. I basically said what the fuck bring my drugs back, he  was confused and said he hadn't even been to my house. I kept insisting  he was and had stolen my acid, he asked me what I was on and we decided I  could be tripping still. We ended the call and I called the other  friend that had left earlier, he also seemed to have no idea what I was  talking about. What the fuck? Now john was unfortunately the type of  person who would do exactly what I had seen him do, I don't think he  would steal from me but he would definitely steal. I had told him I  would search my room for the acid and call him back if I couldn't find  it. I remembered the two pieces of paper and cut one of the perforated  tabs out and ate it. It dissolved right away very unlike blotter paper. I  continued to search my room and actually found a half strip of acid? I  was confused but also still mad about everything that happened so I ate  it. As I started to sober up I looked at my phone and realized they had  never texted to come over and I must have hallucinated that. Then I  realized that I had hung out with two hallucinated people, had  hallucinated acid stolen from me and introduced my dad to my  hallucinated friends, oops. I'm honestly not sure what I ate in my room  because it probably wasn't acid and I didn't really trip but it was hard  to tell because of the DPH. The paper also wasn't even perforated.

Sorry this was a long post I just wanted to include the whole story I hope you enjoyed it!

tldr:  I did DPH hallucinated a very realistic situation, didn't have a sitter  to tell me it wasn't real, DPH isn't fun but if you do it have a  sitter.",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajom7w/dph_trip_story/

29582,Cannabis,I smoked some strong weed and tripped out that I was possessed by the devil 😈,"A few nights ago, I got a hold of a fairly strong strain of weed. I decided to give it a go - naturally. So I smoked about 0.25-0.5 grams (I can't remember exactly) then poured myself a hot bath, to help me relax. I was laying back, the heat lamp glaring in my eyes, making me squint and see lights and colours. I closed my eyes and rubbed them because they were itchy. And the rubbing covered my eye lids with psychedelic patterns which spiralled in and out. Then I felt it, like all the colours were rushing at me and I felt fearsome but in awe, the colours rushing toward me blending into a white light which emerged a figure. An angel, and God was the light which left me feeling as if I were standing next to 100ft cliff.

Then a warning. No signs I just felt it and knew it. Then suddenly the light was penetrated by darkness which slowly grew out, spiralling, closer and closer and the blur of colours fled and I could see a dark devil figure in the gloom. Then it rushed toward me, no clearer as it neared me just a blur of darkness which went straight into my mind.

And that's how I tripped out that I was possessed by the devil - so be careful with you weed kids and have a good time :P",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajpbcu/i_smoked_some_strong_weed_and_tripped_out_that_i/

It worked but then I realised *man psychs are so fun without the anxiety I just felt, shame I had to dampen it. Hmmmm, smoking is supposed to make LSD more intense, and I never feel anxiety on weed so I'll smoke some.* I did and I loved it. Most intense psychedelic experience I ever had. This was about 6 hours in at this point so definitely on the beginning of the comedown. 

My question is, next time should I smoke during the peak to experience this amazingly intense trip again or wait for the comedown? And does weed (if smoked during the peak) extend the trip and if so by how much?

29663,benzos,Xanax gave me a new perspective,"Over the last couple years I’ve been pretty depressed, quiet and rather antisocial. I used to overthink everything and and became my own worst enemy, often jumping to conclusions and assuming the worst in most situations. I was very self-aware and worried about what others thought about me. 
     This week I got my hands on some 1mg Xanax pills, and split one Into 4  0.25mg  doses. I then took 1 dose in the morning before work. Within an hour I felt more talkative and could actually function without overthinking every single decision and conversation. I felt like myself for the first time in years. I repeated the same thing the next day and got the same results. I’m very aware of the dangers of Xanax and how easy it is to get addicted to it because of that feeling, so I went the next couple days without taking any, and even gave away the remaining pills I had. However I felt exactly the same without taking the Xanax. It’s almost as if it slowed down my thoughts just enough to let me examine how I felt and gave me a new perspective on my overthinking and anxiety. I no longer care what people think about me or what they say, and it seems to attract people a lot more.

I never really sought to get baked, generally a few pulls at 180C before throwing on an album and promptly going to sleep, weed is a tool for me. 

As of late, people have made it out that im addicted, generally as snappy comments from friends. I can easily go without it I just don't sleep as well as im reverting back to my 4 or 5 hours a night. My life isnt affected by my use, if anything it is enhanced. I work 30 to 40 hours weekly and am in my 3rd year in a class for gifted students and am regarded as one of most attentive, sharp and intelligent among my peers. 

No problems with memory found as a cause of my use as I take a choline source in the morning with the nootropics I utilize. 

Am I harming myself here? I have a hatred for sleeping pills and would never consider them.  I'm not sure what to do, I need my sleep to function at my high level, but on the other hand i'm shunned for my use. Please give me any advice or criticism you have, all is welcome! Cheers guys!

Everything was fine for a while, but when I noticed I was playing a video game without thinking about it, I remembered that I once heard a theory that there's two consciousnesses in every brain, one for each hemisphere.

That's when I started having someone else's thoughts.  And they were bad thoughts.

It's simplest to believe that remembering that just fucked up my thought patterns, but it's possible, and terrifying, that what I went on to experience was those two consciousnesses fighting.  All I know is, I was having lots of bad thinks.  There was standard ""You're so selfish, nobody wants you around"" stuff, but the scariest one was when midpeak I thought ""Yeah I'm fine to drive, I should go home,"" like some other personality was cleverly manipulating me into killing myself.

That said, it's like nine hours later and I'm home safe and sobered up.  I got off pretty light and have a whole new respect for these substances that I already respected.

I have some vaguely ""scientific"" theories about what happened, if anyone would like to hear them.

29813,Psychedelics,"If you go to sleep out here, you will die.","Ok so basically, me and my friends regularly go to this farm and get incredibly fucked up and go on adventures.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my friends at one of these past parties drank a whole lot of booze. Like I'm talking a big bottle of fuckin wine to himself. Like devouring super cold wings in the dark in the bottom of a closet drunk. This farm used to have a giant pen for pigs that was completely indoors and straight up reeked of feces. Upon entry into this facility, one would be greeted with the horrid stench of pig feces and a whole pig skeleton which remains there to this today. Anyways, regardless, we always made it a tradition to go out and visit the pigs. Visiting the pigs was almost a farm ritual for us. My friend asks if I want to go see the pigs, and as I had dropped acid about 2 hours earlier, I figured swarming masses of pigs would be an interesting sight whilst tripping and naturally obliged. However, the pigs are about a quarter mile away from the house, so post-pigs we were walking back along this rocky path in a field. It was just about 2 degrees F outside (about -16 C), and  my friend slipped on some ice and hit his head on a rock.

&amp;#x200B;

I was startled and hoped he was still conscious. I noticed a little blood on the rocks and got scared. I asked him if he was okay, and if i should get one of the other guys to come help. He takes this dazed look at me from the ground and mumbles ""im. imma.... imma go to sleep"" and then immediately tries to fall asleep on the cold fucking rocks in the winter like an idiot. I leaned down and made the stakes very clear to him when I said, ""Dude, if you go to sleep out here, you will die."" And ofc the dumbass just tries to go back to sleep. So whilst trippin and watching patterns appear in the rocks underneath, very tired and weak, I had to army carry this mother fucker all the way back and toss him down inside.

He later thanked me for saving his life lmao i love him

29825,GABAergics,Alcohol as a painkiller - your thoughts,"So for the past 2 weeks, I’ve been experiencing the flu (medically diagnosed as of today), a pretty bad bout from my own track record. In the mornings it’s been the same - muscular weakness, lethargy, swollen glands, ear pain, sore throat, you get the gist. I’m well aware of the numbing effects alcohol has on cognitive state, as a typical depressant.

I’ve noticed though, that my symptoms have been pretty much cleared after a few drinks (wine and spirits, pretty much just vodka and bourbon). Certainly, I’ve still been experiencing disassociation and some tinnitus but apart from that, my ear aches go away, it’s no longer painful to swallow, and my muscle weakness seems to vastly improve to the point of being able to move around normally. It’s almost like I don’t have an illness at all, except for the lethargy which is a constant reminder.

Of course, it’s not a viable treatment option owing to the intoxicating effect (hence I’d be unable to return to work under the influence) as well as the relatively short duration and damaging effects, but I wanted to know how many other people this applies to. Do alcoholic beverages make common illnesses more bearable to you? ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajt5xv/alcohol_as_a_painkiller_your_thoughts/
29866,Alprazolam,My 16yo Brother Tried to Overdose on Xanax a Couple Weeks Ago...,"So this is an update from my previous post in this subreddit about my younger brother who tried to overdose on Xanax a couple of weeks ago.

To put it into a story, basically, my brother has been slightly different over the past couple of weeks beforehand because he was having relationship issues with his ex. I noticed this change in him beforehand and asked him if he was good and he said yea, so I left it at that.

Come about two weeks later I started to notice his mood change, like he was drunk or something. That's what my mum thought, but I knew straight away he was popping Xanax and quite a bit of it, maybe 2-3 bar pills. But I know for a fact that he's never taken Xanax before, maybe once in his life so he hasn't got any sort of tolerance for it whatsoever. That's a lot to take in one for inexperienced users, especially with the dosage of each pill.

For a couple of days, he was falling over things, words wouldn't come out of his mouth properly and he would end up sleeping for hours while breathing like he was struggling to get air. I never told my mum I thought it was Xanax until the second day I saw him in this state. I had a one on one with him in the morning of the second day when he was slightly recovering and said to him he needs to be careful with that stuff as too large doses for someone who hasn't even got any tolerance too many drugs whatsoever can be fucking lethal. I recommended for him to chuck the rest of them out because I knew the doses he was taking was fucking him up and it wasn't nice for the family to see him walking around like he's out of it all the time. Or if he wasn't gonna listen to me to take much smaller doses when he wants to do it I told him to stick to half a bar for the time being because when he showed me them I knew instantly each bar was 2mg each, and he had about 20 maybe more bars at once. Mum tried everything to get him to show where they are, he wouldn't.

Come that evening, he'd already taken about 2, maybe 3 bars that morning and ignored my advice and ended up knocking himself out for a solid 17 hours. He woke up, Told me to come upstairs to see him and he had about 20 broken up Xanax bars in his hand. I told him if he shoved them down his throat he was gonna kill himself, but he didn't listen to me and right in front of me shoved all 20 of them down his throat at once. That's when I broke down because if he did die that would've been the last memory of my brother and that memory would fuck me up.

Shouted downstairs to my mum and dad saying he needs to get to a hospital ASAP otherwise he could be dead in a couple of hours or so I didn't know! I was panicking too because 2 mins after he took them he collapsed on the floor and didn't respond to anything. I picked him up over my shoulders and had to carry him to my car and I fucking drove the fastest I've ever driven in my life because I didn't want to see my brother die like that. We got to the hospital about 45 mins after he dropped the pills and that's when he started fitting in the car. It was fucking sad for both me, my mum and my dad my mum was in tears because she thought her son was gonna die just like that. Hospital staff rushed to the car and carried him into the resuscitation ward where they had to pump his stomach and give him all this shit to get him to become responsive again.

About an hour later however we get told we're allowed to see him so we did. He seemed alright, a lot better than before now he had his stomach pumped and that was a relief. He tried to take out all his drips and that constantly though so they had to get two security people to hold him down for a solid 3 hours until he calmed down and he kept saying he didn't wanna be there. I thought that would be the end of it, and hopefully, he would've been able to come home the next day if he was good.

Next day comes and it was a fucking terrible day. He was having fit after fit after fit, in the end, he must've had about over 100 fits that day altogether because of the Xanax withdrawal. And they were insane fits as well, like they had to have 5 people holding him down at once because he was fitting so hard. One of the fits lasted a solid 20 minutes and intensive care had to put him in some sort of induced coma for him to stop. What would happen is he would ask my dad or someone if he could go out for a cigarette, have a fit about 10 seconds later and then wake back up and ask him again if he could go out for a cigarette, like he forgets what he had just said. This happened a lot as well it was sad.

2 days later he got let out of the hospital, still had a few fits at home here and there but after about 6 days of fits, he hasn't had one since and now looks to be back to his normal self which is a fucking relief. I don't know what I would've done if I lost my brother with the last thought of him shoving 20 Xans down his throat that would've fucked me up for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure why I wanted to write this, but I just wanted to tell my experience to some people that might appreciate a bit of a sad, but a happy ending with a drug like Xanax. I used to pop Xans quite regularly before too, but since then I've come off the shit just for the fact of what happened with my brother. I did about 2g of ket the day after he had all them fits, mum found out about that and ever since I've been clean just to support my family and that. I can't see my mum in that state again. Made myself a pact that I was gonna get off the drugs, at least for a long while. Xanax can be lethal, but I'm so fucking glad he's now okay and recovered. He's now seeing a counsellor and got himself a new moped so he's making the right steps.

Enjoy the read, just wanted to share my experience with people who might be interested. Lotta love no hate, any

upvotes are appreciated, I wanna get this out to people x

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I forgot to say about 4 hours prior to him doing this he did a fat line of Ket and Charlie and went back to sleep. He's only ever done them two once before a few months ago and has never touched the stuff since until now. Not sure how that affects with the Xans as it was 4 hours prior and anything would've probably worn off, but I thought I'd add that on too. That's what he told me after I had a chance to talk to him when he got discharged from hospital like 5 days later.",56,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajtqf5/my_16yo_brother_tried_to_overdose_on_xanax_a/

29892,Long Post,Long story about getting high on the bus before school and other adventures of high school stoners,"I was a freshman in about 1985 or so. Things were different back then. Almost on a daily basis the stoners all would sit in the back of the bus. The nerds knew their place and didn't even try to question their place....it was the front of the bus. So almost on a regular basis me and my best friend would have gone to our other friends house up the street for morning bong hits in his garage. The bus driver would make a special stop in front of this house to pick us up. Very cool dude but that's another story.

Anyway, most mornings the bong hits were just to wake us up and wasn't all we were smoking so next came the FATTIE. Yep, my friend anthony always had one rolled up for a morning session, right there on the bus. Looking back at it now  it seems crazy but we would light up that joint and pass it around the back of the bus....about 4-5 kids depending on who was cutting, who got suspended etc. etc. We didn't try to hide what we did and I just figured this is what all the stoners did on all the other busses. I remember being on that bus, driving to school and the sun was still just coming up because it was about 7:30 am anyway, I could see this sunbeam cutting a path right through the smoke. We were literally 'Hot Boxing"" our entire school bus with all the nerds (nerds were anyone that was a good kid, got good grades, did their homework and took home books). Some of the kids would open the window in order just to breathe. This went on for a few months. It's possible it went on for years, I don't remember because it was so long ago and also I stopped taking the bus and started getting rides from friends (this is where the real smoke out sessions happened).

Apparently one nerd went to the nurse complaining of a headache from second hand smoke. Plus they said they got a contact high. well that was all the principal and Vice principal had to hear. They were on the hunt to bust us red handed....or maybe green handed? So this one particular day we did not partake in the joint session. We had heard that the heat was coming down. So this day we are traveling and we are on a residential road and a cop pulls over the bus, and there was this light blue K-car following it. The policeman boarded the bus and told everyone to remain in their seats and put their hands on the top of seat in front of us. Then a few people from school boarded the bus, I don't really recall who it was except for Mr. X (disguised for obvious reasons), our vice principal. He then announced there will be assigned seating for some of us and to listen up. The first person they called was anthony. He was kind of the leader of the stoners for no other reason than he always had weed. The VP tells him his seat is the one directly behind the driver next to this fat girl who smelled like expensive foreign cheese. Some of the other stoners were moved accordingly. Anthony said he was not going to sit there because there wasn't enough room. That caused all the stoners and most of the nerds to bust out laughing because everyone knew this chic was like 300LBS fat. The VP calms everyone down and says that if he doesn't sit there then he can't ride the bus. Anthony says no problem and walks off. The rest of us followed. we were about 3-4 miles away from school by road, but we lived near a lot of new developments and wooded areas. We knew all the shortcuts and trails to get to school. Most of the time we didn't even have to be on a road and could walk the trails.

Needless to say we were late to school that day because along the way we all got smoked up since that whole situation wrecked our morning high. After this we were much more careful when smoking on the bus. It's not like we were just going to not smoke, it was a long ride with all the stops. We just used 1 hitters and bowls and tried to be discreet about it. But everyone knew what we were up to. One time Anthony took a huge hit out of a sneak-a-toke, then stood up to open the window so he could blow it out but the window was jammed. We all watched as ANt turned purple then blue as he fought with the window, then finally just exhaling and letting that huge hit out before he passed out. We all laughed as we watched the cloud just hit the closed window and permeate throughout the bus.

For the rest of the year they tried to get us but it seemed like they could never catch us green handed. Another time we boarded the bus there was this lady who picked us up. We knew something was up when she didn't stop in front of anthony's house to pick us up...we had to chase it down until the next stop. We boarded the bus and took one look at the driver. She just looked too clean cut to be a bus driver not some 50 year old hag of a lady that smokes Pal Mals like there is no tomorrow. She just didn't seem like she had a lot of experience driving busses either. She was grinding the gears like she was mad at them. Well the development I lived in was pretty flat except in the back where there were some larger hills. There was a stop at a corner then the bus was supposed to make a left and head up a big hill with 1 stop in the middle. For some reason she could not get this bus into gear. The bus leapt forward and slipped backwards and stalled out a few times. After about 15 mins of her tearing up the transmission she gives up. Ten minutes later and another smaller bus pulled up and a bus driving dude got out and finished the route. Later that year we learned it was a lady cop who was driving the bus. They were hoping to catch us in the act and make an arrest.

&amp;#x200B;

That was an exciting year but it was also the last year I took a bus. The following year anthony got his drivers license and being the spoiled rich kid he was got a brand new 1987 Mustang GT. Now we could session in style before school. In fact we would all meet up with other cool kids at McDonalds parking lot. It was inside a shopping center so there was plenty of parking especially at that hour of the day. There would be anywhere from 5-25 or more cars all lined up passing joints, bongs and bowls back and forth. Even cut a couple of lines here and there. That's where we used to buy 10mg valium for .25 cents from a kid whos dad was a doctor and had bottles of them. Valium was a good way to mellow out your high, make you relaxed enough to sleep through the first 3 periods until the cafeteria opened up for business and served up a majority of the stoners. We all stopped in the first lunch session whether it was on our schedules or not.

Eventually they did get a few of us when the school decided to go all 21 jumpstreet and have a real live narcotics officer pose as a student. He was able to get a few dummies to sell him drugs and at the end of my senior year they dropped the hammer and made a round-up of all the kids that sold to the narc. Luckily I never liked the guy and I always wondered why he was constantly looking to buy drugs yet I never saw him at any parties or in the morning at McDonalds getting our buzz on first thing in the am.",150,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajtzx2/long_story_about_getting_high_on_the_bus_before/

This is my first time posting. I was told to give this a shot by a friend//fraternity brother. 
Woohoo. I was wondering, sincerely, if I'm on the lowest dose (starting dose) of Zoloft (picking up my script tonight, so I should be able to be more specific on the exact dose soon), what drugs I might be able to take? 

I didn't ask my physician at home bc he and my family have been friends for years. Not tryna be narc'd on, if you know what I mean. 

Can I smoke weed?  (Dude I smoke like three blunts a day... so that's almost as important as drinking on the weekends//tonight [thursday, which is AYCD]) 
Trip (LSD, DMT, Shrooms)? 
Snort coke? 
Pop addy? 
Down Xanax? 
Drink pots of coffee? 
Pop molly? 
And one of my bigger concerns: can I drink alcohol? As a college junior I'm concerned about this.. will my few Four Loko's (I know some of you will say eww but hey balling on a pre-bar pregame budget so it's either that, Natty Rush, or Mad Dog) before I go out to a party cause horrible side effects? 

I've always thought of myself as a smart guy. GPA and IQ and Act scores show that. Full ride to college over here. Justifying myself to strangers aside.. I'm hoping for helpful information, if you could. 

Roast away if you think these questions prove the opposite.. but hey at least I'm asking, right? A lot of the information I've found online has been inconclusive so I'm trying to get experiential//informed data here. I recognize that I have recreational habits that are possibly conducive to depression itself and anxiety but I manage them well. I'm just wondering how much more managing I'm going to have to do, if I decide to take these drugs at all.

+0.00:I take 33 pills (25mg each) No longer worried about the amount because I know I can control what happens and know It’s not likely I’ll have a bad trip.  

1.00: I start to see my phone as a blurry nothing I can’t really understand what time is because my mind is gone I’m in another place I’m not sure where. I know few extremely light, like I’m going out of my own body. 

1.30: I’m falling in and out of this weird void I get scared at first because I can hear “the entity” breathing he’s not really saying anything yet but right now it has a very positive vibe to it. 

2.15:I look over at my window in between the falling. Holy shit. It’s gone, there’s nothing but a hole there, my body is trying to stop falling to go into the hole. 

(Side note: I think this is where I fall asleep because I’ve never had this happen on DPH also I live on the river like 25 yards from my house is the river)

2.30:My body goes out of the window I’m floating I can see my body but I look at my hands they are see through. I start to fly but it’s not like on acid I seem to have a problem breathing, god damn I can’t breath. Wait my body will automatically breath so I calm down and start to fly away far far away. 

3.00: so I’m flying slowly above my river. I look at the moon and I see it “the entity” he’s smiling at me I hear it whispering at me yet I don’t hear it. I looked at him all confused and BOOM he yelled at me. That sum bitch yelled at me. Instead of dealing with him I flew away. I looked back and I smiled. He smiled back. I look back at the water and see the reflection of the moon. HOLY SHIT it’s beautiful it’s dark but I know it’s pretty cool so I take a “mental screenshot. 

3.30: I’m peaking now so I start flying higher and higher until I reach the clouds I get a boost and break through but as I do I see spiders flying towards me i ignore them and continue on. I see these things with no physical form I chill with them for a while as they speak tongues to me and I remember completely understanding them. 

4.20 (4.30 lol): (at this point I’m coming down) i hear it again it’s the fucking entity. He followed me here and now the “gods” are gone he’s screaming at me to get home before I end up dead and before I know it I wake up on my floor in my room I stand up and fall back asleep forgetting what woke me up was my alarm for my college class.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just a 12 year old 7th grader who has been interested in drugs for years. Recently I discovered DPH. I have been researching it for a few weeks, and decided I would do it today because it's Friday. On Tuesday, I tell my friend about DPH. He is absent the next day. Lmao. On Thursday, he told me that he took 24 pills of DPH, 25 mg each (600 mg). He gave me a pretty detailed trip, saying that he thought he was watching youtube but it was a CEV and his phone wasn't even in the same room as him. I say, ""Hey, tomorrow can you bring me 8 pills of Benadryl? I'll give you this pack of fruit snacks from the cafeteria."" This always cracks me up haha. Today he brings me 6, not 8, but it's okay. He told me he took 9 in the morning and his body is numb. I gave my friend one so he could fall asleep in class (because he asked me to for that exact reason, I'm not drugging him lol.)

Now, in 2nd period (Spanish), I am working on a project with 2 eighth grade girls, which have no idea. I start to get super drowsy and yawning. I take 1 more pill during the project. Later (around end of 2nd period or 3rd period) I take 2 more down in one gulp again. I am very tired at this point, I have ingested 125 milligrams. Very low dose but I weigh like nothing and I have no tolerance. During passing period from 3rd to 4th, the people in the halls look slightly weird. As I get to 4th period, I fall asleep 4 or 5 times, my friends were imitating me because I fell asleep with my mouth wide open. I can feel it all kick in now. I'm not tired anymore but I slept through the work.

(WHEN IT KICKS IN)

My hands are shaky as hell, my stomach kinda hurts, minor heartburn, but it's ignorable. The lunch bell rings. I stand up and run to the lunch line to be first, but as soon as I step out of the room I am struck with a GREAT euphoric effect and repeat the words ""Oh my god!"" or ""What the fuck?"" 3 times, and then I dissociate from my body and I can't feel myself running. I walk with the friend who gave me the pills. We go to the bathroom after I finish my lunch and he's right behind me. I shout his name and say ""Come here!"" so I can ask him if I can ask him for more. Then he says his name again but with a very questioning tone. I look at something down the hall and look back and it's not him. He changed into another one of my friends. I would have sworn I saw that other kid. I am very confused at this point and have a dissociative/euphoric wave again. I go up into this conference room and I swear I was so retarded I told like all my friends in there how fucked up I was. They ask me a lot about it and then I snap out of it and realize they might snitch. I told them, ""No it was an accident, I took too much allergy medicine because of these allergies I'm getting. Just forget about it."" Then I am hit with another wave and fall into one of the chairs. It just feels great, though. I walk out of the room and walk back in and I fucking say ""Just don't tell anyone."" like an idiot. Surprisingly, I was never called into the office in the remaining 2 periods, and during 5th period I'm on the comedown. I am now pretty much sober (5 o'clock, ended school at 2:30) and just saying, I rate this experience an 8/10, would definitely try again.

(AFTERWARDS)

I was talking to the kid who gave me the pills. Told him I thought our trips ruined our friendship. He said that's not true and we're still cool. He just told me he doesn't want to ever do it again for a while. I have no hangover, more of an afterglow. I go to the store with a few friends and I have a pretty good mood. Bought candy and soda. Now I'm home listening to music thinking if I should trip again or leave the substance alone. Next trip will be 150-200 mg, maybe with some DXM.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: took 125mgs of dph at school for first time without tolerance, got surprisingly euphoric. felt dissociative.

edit: thanks for all the advice. appreciate this sub.

edit 2: forgot to tell you that at some times during the trip, the euphoria would become so great that i would raise my arms up to the ceiling like a bird and think that i could fly. i think half the school saw me do this and they probably thought i was retarded.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajw6j8/first_time_ever_getting_high_today/

There must be more.

And here I sit, alone on a Friday night contemplating the depths of the universe or am I just staring at my phone..

""There must be more"" the thought rings in my ears. Continuously these days I am diving deep in this thought, prodding it like a farmer would a bull. Did my ancestors think these thoughts? Hell, did my parents think these thoughts? Or is this an adaptation of the common 'first world problems'

I sit here in this home I've built, with all the hours I've put in and somewhere deep down i despise myself, or do I despise the life I've built.... 

""Who cares anyways.."" I whisper to myself.

Continually I've built myself up to this height, far surpassing people my age, to feel powerful, to be important and most of all to impress my father. But nothing is enough and at the same time, everything is enough for me. I torn by the idea of pushing past all the limits in my career, building it as high as it will go, climbing the corporate mountain, or running away from it all. 

Or is that what I want? 

Do I want to travel the world, help third world countries and live in the most extreme places on earth. God knows I could do that, I can do anything i put my mind to. Ive always been able to, but what do I want to do. What is it all for anyways? Build a mountain of cash but not enjoy any of it.

These moments are all but everlasting, and my youth is slipping through my hands. As my hair thins and I start to age I can start to feel older and all with that I'm becoming 'unimpressive'... my chance to do something meaningful and impactful is slipping, or at least I think it is. It's in these moments or sheer 'emptiness' that I really ponder what I need to do or what I'm meant to do. 

Sometimes I feel so unattached and unpassionnate and other times I'll move mountains. What does it even mean?

As I sit here, and contemplate life I can't help but think... ""There must be more.""

But alas I will wake up tomorrow, one day older, pretending to be the happy go lucky successful man 'i am' and endure another day of people.

30168,LSD,"Took 3 tabs of acid over a weekend and now stuck in a trip, 3 months later.. (very mild but still lol)","So about 2 months back I went to a music festival in regional Australia, took 1 tab on Friday and 2 on Saturday.
2 tabs were from one guy and the other tab from someone else.

They weren't too bad, definitely had stronger but for some reason I'm still seeing slight visions when I concentrate on it, usually just this spinny thing that I always see when I trip.

Although, about 2-3 weeks after, I was a bit stoned in bed trying to sleep, half asleep I was focusing on this spinny thing then BAM i see this incredibley intense alien-like power plant image (best I can describe it) for like 2 seconds then it disappeared. It was the most intense visuals I'd ever seen in my life. Mind you I hadn't tripped since the music festival.

Apart from what I've explained I've been able to function as per usual. 

Kinda sucks cause I enjoy tripping frequently but I don't wanna trip again until this thing is gone just to be safe (although I hadn't tripped for a good 4 months before the music festival as the trip before the music festival was a pretty bad trip so I needed some time out I figured). 

I can't really find much about this on the Internet and just wanted others opinions. 

Peace yo ✌️

30223,Antidepressants &amp; Stimulants,Brain Damage?,"I  took Vyvanse 30 mg for a month and it alleviated my brain fog, made me  focus slightly more, and made me a happier person overall. My side  effects were loss of apetite, a very anxious feeling for a few hours in  the day, and feeling like only the right side of my head was clear and  the left was peanut butter.

Because of  my size and the fact that the medicine didn't last very long I moved up  to 50 mg of Vyvanse. My brain fog came back. I could focus better but  the brain fog alleviation was one of the main reasons that I was so  thankful for the medication. I didn't realize that I could focus better  at the time and got somewhat worried that the medication had stopped  working because of the brain fog. After that I became scared of all ADHD  medication. I thought that maybe I had some sort of sensitivity to  Vyvanse and that it may have caused brain damage. I was worried that  maybe I had some sensitivity that made it so I took the equivalent of  100 mg to normal people but my sensitized self only had to take 50 mg.

I  stopped the medication and was put on Lexapro (I was diagnosed with  anxiety and depression alongside my ADHD). After I started Lexapro I  started concerta just to try but was scared of it and stopped. I later  tried Mydayis but was scared of it and stopped. So far I stopped Lexapro  because I got scared that it could cause brain damage. Then I tried  Wellbutrin but that caused rashes so I stopped. Now I'm on Cymbalta.  I've just been worrying that these medications have messed up my brain  real bad and caused brain damage and would like some opinions. Am I just  being paranoid and letting internet stuff and my anxiety get to me or  are my concerns legitimate? I haven't felt like myself and my ability to  think has gotten much worse.

30226,In memoriam,"Letter to Lucy, my best friend and worst enemy.","Dear Lucy,

It's been awhile without you Lucy. I want to thank you for the amazing times we have had together. The way we used to laugh together. The nights we would spend up till 5am in deep thoughts talking with each other. The nights where you would press your tongue against my cheeks. You showed me a beautiful side of the world I never thought I would see. I was in love with you. I would always say. Let's spend more time together, let's get closer, I need more of you in my life. For once my life was complete. And I was content with life for once. All my mental pain and past never bothered me when I was with you.

But the closer we got the worse our relationship got. I'd spend days and weeks with you. Getting as close as I could get. I will never forget the night we broke up Lucy. You brought me to the bad side of town. You showed me the worst about me and told me all my flaws. I tried stopping you but you kept screaming ""You won't ever have a future."" and ""welcome to hell you piece of shit"". You controlled me. You made me have a panic attack for 16 hours straight while I contemplated suicide. You told me so much about the bad side of life and you opened my perspective on life. You kept telling me ""there is no god"" and ""this is the end"". You would tell me ""your going to hell, you are worthless"". I'd scream back ""I can't believe you backstabbed me bitch, how could you do this to me. I fucking trusted you.""

You packed your bags in the morning and left. I told you I never wanted to see you again, and I meant it. I still feel your presence to this day. No matter where I go Lucy. You are always on my mind. I don't miss you, I hope you would just leave me the fuck alone. But you will always be on my mind. Till the day I die.

But I am glad we don't talk anymore Lucy. We weren't meant to be anything more than friends. Maybe we weren't even meant to be anything at all. I'll never be able to forget the side of hell you showed me. You took me to a heaven that was disguised as hell. 

I hope you find you place somewhere in the world Lucy. I know you can help other people battle their demons. But you couldn't help mine, as you were my demon after all.

30281,Story Time,Overly Attached Drug Dealer,"A few months back, I was going to pick up some acid and molly from this guy who’s contact I got from a friend. I hadn’t ever met this person before, just had some mutual contacts. So, I send this kid a snap asking if he can meet up, and he tells me to meet him at his house, then sends me his address. Well, on my way over, he starts trying to video call me while I’m driving my damn car, which struck me as somewhat odd, but I answer anyways. He says, “Yooo, when you get here, you should totally smoke up with me.” I say something along the lines of, “I appreciate the offer man, but I have places I need to be tonight.” He doesn’t seem to get it though, and continues on with, “Yeah, just let me know when you’re done with your errands and you can come back to my place and smoke up!” I say, “That’s nice of you to offer and all, but I gotta get up early tomorrow dude.” He just responds with, “That’s okay,” then hangs up. A few minutes go by before I receive another message from him. This one reads, “I’m gonna ask my mom if you can spend the night.” Those were his actual words. I kid you not.

So, at this point I don’t even know what to say anymore, and am starting to question wether or not he’s actually selling tabs or if he’s just lonely and wants someone to spoon with. I honestly kind of feel bad for him. Anyways, I show up to his house exactly when I said I would to pick up my shit, half expecting to be roofied. I shoot him a snap, but he doesn’t respond. I wait 15 minutes, try calling him- and nothing. Another 15 minutes go by of just waiting around, and at this point, I’m getting kind of nervous because I’ve just spent half an hour standing outside some random ass house and I don’t even know if it’s the right place. My black van doesn’t help my image too much, either.

Well, I start to hear a familiar voice coming from around the corner, the same voice from the video call. I walk around to the side of the house, see a lit window, and can hear the same kid laughing hysterically in a room alone by himself. I spend another 10-20 minutes trying to get his attention on Snapchat, all while listening to him laugh psychotically from outside his window, but he doesn’t respond. This was not a successful exchange to say the least. I’m pretty sure I tried to buy x off of Norman Bates’ grandkid. ",1131,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ajxhru/overly_attached_drug_dealer/

30327,Psychedelics,How to take LSD without a test kit 'safely',"Hello everyone,

First of all let it be said that if you plan on taking LSD on a regular basis or if you plan on taking more than '200 mcg' you MUST BUY A TEST KIT.

If you can afford LSD then you can afford a test kit and there is no excuse not to get one unless you do not care about doing psychedelics responsibly.

THIS 'HOW TO' IS AIMED TO PEOPLE WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN THE SITUATION THEY REALLY CAN NOT GET A TEST KIT OR IT IS NOT WORTH BUYING

Maybe you will only try it once, maybe you trully can't buy a test kit for whatever reason... and I know this may seem a bit (or a lot) contradictory to what's been said about ""no excuses"" but I know that a lot of people will be dumb and take LSD without testing it first (I actually think most people do anyway...) so I figured it would be a good idea to add some tips on how to do it more safely.

NEVER TRUST YOUR DEALER

He is probably not your friend, and even if he is, he may not know what's on the tab he is selling you because the guy who sold the tab to him in the first place may be the liar, or any guy above that for that matter so... no matter what, you don't know what is on your tab just because ""your dealer told you so"" or because ""he's already given me good acid in the past"", again, his intentions may be good but he may not know.

Also, even if he knew it was not real acid, well... of course if you ask him he will tell you it is the good shit.

WHY WOULD SOMEONE SELL YOU FAKE ACID?

Well it all comes down to profit, some people just sell empty tabs claiming it is LSD but obviously they lose clients fast (no one will buy anything from them twice) so they came up with the perfect scam: research chemicals (RC).

RC's are chems available online legally ""Not for human consumption"", that (in this context) usually have different recreational use, generally similar or analogous to an illegal drug.

This is not meant to be a guide on RC's so I won't get deep on this but just know that there are RC's that have similar effects to those of LSD but with very different safety potentials. Most RC won't kill you at low doses but they are considerably more dangerous and toxic than LSD and that is why testing your acid is important.

Selling some of this chems claiming them to be LSD is fairly common, and again, done because they are sometimes easier to get and also cheaper.

SIMPLE THINGS TO CONSIDER:

I. I must say it again, it is your body and your only brain and you should probably not risk it. If you can get a test kit, please do. Also read the psychonauts wiki/erowid pages on LSD.

II. TASTE: LSD should be tasteless, if your dose has any flavour (other than paper) it is probably not LSD and you shouldn't probably take it.

# NOT 100 % EFFECTIVE #

III. EAT THE LSD: Acid's bioavailability is pretty much the same when swallowed whereas it varies a lot for some RC's. So it would be wise to eat your dose instead of taking it under your tounge.

# NOT 100 % EFFECTIVE #

IV. DON'T GO TOO FAR: while acid is a very safe (regarsin LD 50) compound to consume at ""high"" doses (300-500 mcg), RC's are a whole different story, some can be dangerous at rather low doses so I would advice not taking more than two tabs... or what would be an equivalent of 200 mcg of supposed lsd. 

Of course there is no way to tell how strong a hit will be, so be very careful and work your way up but NEVER GO HIGH  if you do not have tested lsd.

V. DONT DO IT OFTEN: Again lsd is rather safe to consume ""regularly"" but RC are probably not (most of them have unknown long term effects) so like I said at the beggining of the post, if you plan to go high or often... get a test kit.

NOTE: All of this should keep you ""safe"" if you only take a small dose of a RC, ""safe"" meaning you won't die nor have long term side effects. But please do not follow this path often and this DOES NOT SUBSTITUTE a proper test kit by any mean.

Bonus tip:

LSD should be bright under UV light (black light) so if you happen to have one UV rod or something around (I personally tested an old one used to check bills) you can test the blotter to see if it has lsd.

I have only tried it with potent papers and it works in a dark room, the paper seems to light up under the UV wand. Beware it can degrade the acid if exposed for too long and it won't work of the concentration per area is not high enough. But... if you happen to have an UV source around it is worth the try.

30601,Psychedelics,Optimal LSD dose for first time,"
I was thinking about doing LSD for the first time and I am wondering what the best dose for a beginner is. I don't want a completely overwhelming experience and I'd rather go a bit to low then a bit to high. The only other drugs I tried are MDMA, Weed and alcohol. I am planning on doing this with another 2-4 friends of wich at least one will be sober and tripsitting us. For the setting I have planned a place right next to a field and not too far away from my friends house (at most 1km).

 I am thankfull for any tips you can give me!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ak06z0/optimal_lsd_dose_for_first_time/
30602,Stimulants,Coke tips from some old pros,"TLDR; Used to snort lots of oxy but this is a bit different. Need a few pointers to streamline my ritual


So right now I have a small glass jar that holds about 5 gs of powder and I usually chop lines on my phone screen or iPad since it's the closest glass to me. 
My main problem is as I'm making the lines even a decent amount of powder will stick to the razor blade, no matter how clean, new or used it may be, causing me to either use another knife to scrape it back off or smack it on the glass a few times making a good amount of noise. I've tried credit/debit/ID/even memberships cards and they seem to be even worse. 

My second question is what's they best storage method? I have tons of small baggies and also some small bottles/jars that are nice but idk about how it will last in there. 

Last question (I promise) what is y'all's preference on what to snort with? I've tried rolled up money and thought it was kinda for show and I have actually been using half of a cheap pen that I took apart.

30622,Quetiapine,Seroquel withdrawal feels like dying - help needed," 

**Tldr at the bottom.** 

Hey! 

I’m a 24-years old woman in a  great physical shape. I started Seroquel in September 2017. My diagnosis  was anxiety disorder, depression and cyclothymia (minor bipolar like  symptoms). Personally, I don’t feel like I have or have had cyclothymia.  I think I have just always been sensitive to my surroundings and I’m  just overall a sensitive person when it comes to feeling emotions. At  the beginning of the medication the goal was to stabilize my mood and to  help me sleep better.  

Dosage was 200mg on average during that  period, in September 2018 the dosage was increased to 300mg for a week.  Then I realized that the quality of my life wasn’t good, and I believed  that the Seroquel was just causing troubles. After the dosage was  increased I experienced even more anxiety and irritation. I also blacked  out once after the increase, which isn’t common for me at all. That’s  when I decided that I will start decreasing the dosage and eventually  stop using it for good. In September 2018 I started to lower my dosage.  My psychiatrist didn’t provide me with any guidance with the tapering  and I ended up lowering the dosage from 300mg to 100mg in 1 month. In  hindsight that was too quick, during that time I took a bit more and a  bit less on some days depending how I felt. The decrease was really  wearing me out, so I stayed on the 100mg for 3months, from October to  December. By that time my anxiety and depression were through the roof.   

The decreased dosage of Seroquel was making me tired all the  time during days but failed to help me to get sleep at night. I felt  groggy all the time and it was hard to get anything done. Gradually I  started to notice other negative symptoms that Seroquel was causing. My  depression and anxiety kept going worse and I started having issues with  urinating. On top of that it was causing hormonal issues and many other  physical disfunctions. I mentioned all my symptoms to my psychiatrist  in January 2019, she said that Seroquel was causing the urinary  retention problems among others. She stated that I should get off the  meds as fast as possible, since it was Seroquel that was worsening my  depression and anxiety. On 8th of January I lowered my dosage to 50mg  and on 17th of January I stopped using it completely.  

Quitting  this medication has been extremely hard for me. I’m extremely depressed,  anxious and tense. I don’t sleep well, I only stay asleep for short  periods and the quality of my sleep is poor and I keep seeing horrible  nightmares. I’m exhausted all the time and I have a sense of impending  doom, I can’t even begin to imagine that I could someday feel okay. I’m  constantly restless, tense and my body shakes from stress and all this  strain. My heart rate is always elevated, I have zero appetite and I’m  nauseous to the point that I often throw up, usually in the mornings. I  have lost around 10% of my weight in a month, and I was fit to begin  with. My brain feels like jelly and I feel foggy all the time. I have  memory issues and its difficult to concentrate on anything. I have  trouble making simple decisions. My migraine has gone worse and my  stomach is given me a really hard time. I have an IBS and I have to go  to the toilet several times a day and my stomach hurts like hell. I  still have problems urinating. I keep getting multiple panic attacks  weekly, many times a day at worst. It is hard for me to leave my house  and to meet people. Even the closest people around me feel like  strangers at times. The list of symptoms is endless, this withdrawal has  made all the possible problems that I had even worse. My back aches, my  period pains are worse than ever. I have restless feet and I keep  getting brain zaps and muscle twitches. My body itches like hell every  now and then. Some days I have fever. I’m having a considerable amount  of suicidal thoughts. My mood swings are giving me a very tough  time, my mood goes from extremely anxious and depressed to feeling empty  and then aggressive for example. Everything feels like nothing, I feel  dead inside. Future seems hopeless and I feel unrealistic all the time,  it feels like I’m not a human anymore. The whole world feels odd and I  feel that I don’t belong here at all. I have unrealistic delusions about  myself and others. My senses have sharpened in an unrealistic manner. I  cannot escape my racing thoughts and they are overwhelming. I fear  constantly that I will hurt myself.  

I have spoken to my  psychiatrist about my symptoms and I got prescribed 20mg of temazepam to  get sleep, which doesn’t really help at all. I take it rarely and with  great caution because I don’t want to develop another dependency. I have  diazepam and oxazepam to calm me down with the worst panic attacks. I  tend to stay away from benzos as much as I can since I have been through  benzo withdrawal once. Even though it felt like child’s play compared  to this Seroquel withdrawal. 

I was also on 100mg of Zoloft for a  few years. Which I stopped gradually when I started to taper off from  Seroquel in September 2018. I started taking Zoloft again in January  2019, precisely 3 weeks ago. So far I haven’t noticed any positive  improvements from the Zoloft. Not sure if its even possible during this  withdrawal. 

I feel completely hopeless. Everyday is a living hell  with these withdrawal symptoms. On some days all I can do is cry. I  feel like this will last forever and its not going away. I’m scared that  my brains won’t recover from the Seroquel and that I have caused  permanent damage. 

When can I expect to feel better? When will my  brain recover? Is it possible that the medication has done permanent  damage to my brain? I eat healthy nutritious natural food, I take  vitamins and I exercise and take long walks in nature as often as I’m  possibly able. I have recently started doing yoga, and it feels good. 

Apart  from all the misery, I have noticed some positive changes as well. I  have started to feel real emotions again. I can cry and get emotional  from movies and books for example. Also, I’m able to truly laugh at  times. 

If you have any experiences or advices regarding to my  situation please share, I would appreciate all the help from the bottom  of my heart. 

**TLDR: Withdrawal from Seroquel is making me  lose my mind. My body isn’t functioning. I have a constant feeling of  impending doom. I feel hopeless and suicidal. I have been roughly 9 days  off the meds. Do you have any advices or experiences to share? How soon  can I expect to recover to a point that I don’t feel completely fucked  all the time?** ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ak0iq1/seroquel_withdrawal_feels_like_dying_help_needed/
30628,Lisdexamphetamine,switching from Adderall to Vyvanse,"Hey guys, I've been taking Adderall since I think early 2013. I managed to grow a tolerance to it over time, and while I got up to 30mg XR twice a day (Which is pretty crazy apparently) it just didn't work like it used to.

I talked to my doctor and asked if there were any alternatives he could prescribe, and he suggested Vyvanse. 

I'm starting at 50mg to start with, which my doctor told me was a higher dose than normal because of my Adderall dosage. Currently, I'm about an hour or two into my first dose and I like it so far.

I guess I have a few questions regarding switching I'd like to ask.

1) Is the weight loss side effect as intense as Adderall? When I started taking addies, I weighed 400 pounds, and by the end of the year, I was down to 145. I'm not trying to imply that this is a make or break point, weight loss is not what the drug is for, but I had a lot of weight gain from another medication I took and I've made it to overweight status again and it WOULD be nice to shed some pounds, even if its nothing crazy like I had before.

(SIDE NOTE) I don't actually know how weight loss works for these meds. I know that it dampens your appetite, but is that the only thing it does? Is there another mechanic that makes you lose weight besides the fact that you're kinda starving yourself?

2) Because I was on such a high dose of Adderall and grown tolerant to it, will that affect the effectiveness of the Vyvanse? I have heard that they use different ingredients like amphetamine salts and such but I don't want to take a new drug that's not even as effective as the last one I took.

3) how long do you notice the effects lasting? My doctor said 10 hours or so, but when the 30mg xrs were working right before, I was cruising all day and getting stuff done until I went to sleep. Is there a period where certain aspects of the drug are still active and others aren't?

4) I guess finally, to anyone who's also made this switch, is there anything, in particular, I should know? something I'm not covering here in this rushed post.

Thanks, everyone, hopefully this is a positive change for me!

30679,Buprenorphine,Suboxone and DXM,"I've heard in the past that DXM will increase the potency of opioids/opiates. I tested that out with Morphine 30mgs in the past and just on Monday tried it out with Suboxone. 
So take notice, I didn't plan on doing Suboxone that day, that's why I went to Kroger and got myself a 5oz. bottle of Delsym which is roughly 888mg of DXM. I had been doing that much Delsym on the regular for the past few weeks and so I deemed it a good dose to do again. Along comes this guy I met through a guy I was in rehab with. They were in the same jail cell in the county jail. Well this guy started gravitating towards me and eventually was sitting with me. 
After sharing a cigarette he took 4mg Suboxone and I got curious and asked for some. He was reluctant to give me any but then gave me a little sliver that I would estimate was 2mg of it. I let the suboxone strip (not sure what it's called, heard it called a strip in the past) dissolve on my tongue. A little while goes by and holy shit I was balls to the walls higher than I have ever been on any DXM combination.
It was about 13°F outside and I went out with just a hoodie and some pants, felt warm enough to just walk across downtown (about 1.5 miles) to my friends house were I laid on a couch, my face itched more than it's ever itched, and I felt energized like what people have described Oxys to me. I watched 3 movies, Beautiful Boy (7.6/10), Split (8.2/10), and Avengers: Infinity War (7.5/10). Never have I enjoyed just laying on a couch and watching movies in my life. 
But after a long day of tripping/being high on Suboxone I decided to call it a night around 2am. I curled up on the couch and had apparently slept through someone knocking on the door but it felt like I had tossed and turned all night. 
Overall my experience with Suboxone and DXM combination was very delightful and I would look forward to another Suboxone fulfilled night. Next time, hopefully soon, I will do just Suboxone and not mix anything with it. :) 

TLDR; Mixed a 5oz. bottle of Delsym (888mg dxm) with 2mg Suboxone and watched 3 generally good movies, before sleeping, yet the sleep I had gotten felt like I tossed and turned, I had slept through someone knocking on the door. Enjoyed the trip overall. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ak14je/suboxone_and_dxm/

30715,Psychedelics,How I fried myself,"So about a year ago I ordered 50 tabs of 125μg acid, I ate all of them (about 1/2 of the time with friends and other times alone). I finished them all in about a month.

 I treated the substance with almost no respect, for instance once I had 2 tabs at ~9pm tripped balls through the night then dropped another 2 the next morning and 1 more at ~3pm to keep it going (along with smoking 3.5g of bud throughout the day).

I also dropped 2-4 times a week and would try more just to find the acid wasn't working even after 3 tabs because of tolerance. So damn retarded looking back. I think I just wanted to escape reality and enter another dimension. WHAT A DUMB IDEA!

My last trip was a particularly dark one (on 225μg) and ended up with me running away from the group I was with (only 1 other tripping out of 5). My friend who was also tripping ended up pissing over the bed and leaving as well. There were LOTS of schizophrenia esq symptoms, far more than other trips.

After the tabs ran out I began to discover the the extent I had fried my brain. I had gone from a fairly social straight A student in GCSE's (UK exams at 16) to being unable to properly hold a conversation - it's really hard to explain its just like my thought processes aren't the same and the flow is gone. Getting fired from a £3.70/hr tech support job for being incompetent, I was actually trying but the talent on my CV was gone. And slowly loosing all my friends as a result being left as a useless hermit shell of my former self. I could go into more detail but it's really hard to explain what's different just take it as a cautionary tale - RESPECT THE SUBSTANCES OR PAY WITH YOUR BRAIN!",1885,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ak1fim/how_i_fried_myself/

I have a pretty strong character, can I smoke without 
getting mentally addicted?

Is it ok to smoke once in a while, considered I am 17? (Once in 3 months)

Moderation smoking can be that harmful?

30785,Cannabis,Weed after various psychedelic discussion,"Hey fellas, 

So a long story short, weed has been profoundly changed for me since when I first started smoking it. 

I tried acid for the first time last summer, and I heard people mentioning how ""weed will never be the same after"", but in my case, none of that was true, in fact weed has always been the 'same' for me after numerous trips in my life. 

However, if I may recall, back in early december. Weed has been acting strange recently, instead of making me peaceful and ever so loving like marley. 

It now gives me this life threatening crushing sensation to my organs. I start thinking about how I am gonna die by not breathing and I have to try my absolute hardest to keep my shit together. 

It has also fucked my vision up big time. Some people say it's 'visual snow', but I'm not too sure, it's almost as if I see this second layer of reality which is just of nothingness. Just pure blue, yet transparent. It's like if you close one eye, you sort of see the darkness from the other eye whilst you're still looking out of the other. Will its the same but just like blue air? Sometimes its often blinding, and I cant focus on someones face.

I have a few theories about how and why, one of them is because I did DMT, and smoking weed after gave me an out of body like experience where I mentally experienced a breakthrough and felt like I turned into the entire universe. Hell, it sounds awesome, but experiencing that on weed? Not so much, I start panicking thinking I'm dying/dead. Whereas with other drugs, I know what to expect from the high. 

Anyway, recently I have been smoking a whole lot less weed. Like you're taking a scrap from the grinder and it fucks me up, but not too much where I feel like I am becoming psychotic. 

I'm sort of getting used to this realization of this visual thing I am experiencing. But I remember way back last year, just from weed alone, I got all these crazy visuals from it, its all in my head of course, not in my reality. Besides this ""visual snow"". I also had this sort of 'alternative state of mind' where I experience myself in parallel universes. It's happened to me quite a few times now. 

Anyways, the moral of the story is that I am going to Amsterdam tomorrow for a few days. I should be okay, with taking it easy on weed and such. But what about edibles? I heard that eating weed, had a 5x psychoactive effect than smoking THC? 

I am fully aware that THC can't kill a man, but surely if I just go through it and ride it out, I have pretty much overcome the concept of fear &amp; death?

Is there anyone out there that is in a similar boat to me? Where weed just somehow feels like it has become really intense for them for an unknown reason? Maybe with visual problems too?

TL;DR - Is a edible a good idea after experiencing life changing sequences from psychedelics 

PS: I started experiencing all these fucked up things like a month later from my previous acid trip which was 200ug. But I recall experiencing all this from the start. Maybe one day I just clicked the reset button and I am jumping to conclusions. Sry for the cluster fuck of messages that lead to all sorts of directions.

30814,Psychedelics,Are these feelings on psyches normal?,"I have noticed a couple things that happen with my body on psyches that I’m not sure if they are normal

1. I’ve taken acid 3 times (100ug) and two of the times i’ve come up i get this feeling that I’m going to be sick, it’s like a tingling feeling all over my body but it’s more pronounced in my stomach and my throat, then once i start feeling this it’s almost all I’m fixated on and then my mood goes down compared to being all prepared at the start (first time this happened i was ok after about an hour, 2nd time i stayed sat on the sofa with a blanket and a bucket, the feeling went away maybe around 4 hours later)

2. I’ve taken shrooms twice (1g, then 2g), and both times i felt like i constantly need to go to the bathroom or otherwise i’ll piss myself, but when i get to the toilet i don’t need to go at all? I’d get distracted looking at the shampoo slowly making it’s way closer to the conditioner and my vision was almost like everything was breathing, so i’ll go back to where i came from and a couple minutes later the situation would just repeat itself and i’d get up

3. I’ve tried 4 aco dmt 3 times, but on one occasion where i was tripping by myself, i felt really uncomfortable, so i went for a shower (as I’ve read this can feel really calming and serene when tripping), but then i got this sense of impending doom while i was showering and as if my whole mind was panicking and i didn’t know what to do, i call my buddy over and we hung out, despite my trippin ass i was able to talk but i did still feel like i was in a constant state of panic until the trip started wearing down and we played games until the end

There was also another occasion on 4 aco dmt where i was around a lot of people dancing to the music but i felt like i needed to get away from everyone, so me and my friends sat away for a moment, then later in the night i didn’t have a care in the world if anyone was looking at me while i was walking back to the tent

Have you guys had any similar situations? Are these body sensations normal?

But a few minutes later after my friend gave it just one hit, he complained about being sweaty and uncomfortable. Only like 5 minutes after that he was completely passed out on the couch mumbling some weird shit. I was concerned but didnt really do anything until he literally began screaming and spasming out uncontrollably, he was totally unresponsive and I had to jump on top of him to cover his mouth because my parents were sleeping upstairs. He faded in and out of conciousness for the next few hours, each time he woke up he would ask ""whats happening"".

Flash forward to the next morning when we both slept off the high and began to talk about it. He described his experience as being able to see whats happening around him but not being able to move or do anything and he was terrified. We both agreed that the cart probably did not contain THC and was likley some synthetic weed type shit he was allergic to. When I think back on it that seems plausible but I was wondering if anyone on here had any better ideas on what could have happened. Any comments are appreciated, sorry this is so long.

30947,Long Post,Datura harm reduction guide.,"Let me preface this by saying I have never done datura, and I do not condone its usage.  Datura is actually toxic, and I don't want anyone to think this guide encourages its use. I am making this on the principle that there are kids who are going to do it regardless of what we say. This shitty guide will hopefully save someones life.

Datura is a type of nightshade, it contains atropine, tropanes, scopolamine, and some other alkaloids.  Scopolamine is the actual psychoactive substance in datura.  The other substances are non active toxins.  This is one of the reasons why datura is so dangerous.  There are actually other nightshade plants that contain scopolamine, most notably: mandrake, belladonna, and a couple of others that I can't remember.  I recommend using mandrake over datura, as it has less amounts of the other toxic alkaloids than datura, which is considered one of the most toxic.

Datura's main psychoactive chemical, scopolamine, is an anticholinergic.  It has a similar mechanism of action to diphenhydramine (benadryl) which is why they are classified as delirients.  They produce unique effects that are almost universally considered negative.  

I must mention that this is not a fun 'get high' drug.  I can almost guarentee you will not enjoy it.  I understand that younger teenagers will be interested in trying it because it grows in their backyard and they don't have access to regular drugs, but trust me, it is worth the wait until you get older.  Nobody can prepare for a datura trip.  Anybody that thinks they can do it because they are a 'seasoned psychonaut' is terribly mistaken.  This is unlike any other drug.

Notice how I have not written the actual guide yet.  This is intentional, I really want to emphasize that you WILL NOT enjoy this.  You will be in hell, and you can die from it.  If after all this I have not convinced you to skip using datura, read ahead on how you can lower your chances of mental scarring/PTSD/Permanent brain damage/death.

One of the problems with consuming datura is the fact that it is impossible to acurately assess dosage.  Some seeds have higher concentrations of scopolamine/other toxins than others.  There is no way for you to tell how potent the seeds you have will be.  Because of this, you need to be EXTREMELY conservative on how much you can injest.  Think about how much you could probably handle.  Now cut that amount in half.  Now cut it in half again.  Do not underestimate datura and do not overestimate your ability to handle it. ~~I recommend taking a 1/4 or less of the seeds in a pod to reduce the chance of intoxication or overdose.~~ As I have said before, you cannot prepare for what is about to happen.  If you take too much, you can die.  This is arguably the most dangerous part of datura: the acute toxicity.

The second most important thing is having a SOBER trip sitter.  THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.  YOU NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL BE SOBER AND WHO IS ABLE TO PHYSICALLY RESTRAIN YOU.  There was a story around either here or erowid about a guy who took datura and had a sober girl tripsit him, and he ended up violently raping her.  These are things that can happen on datura.  You can and will do things you would never do sober.  You must have someone who cannot be physically overpowered by you to watch you.  Taking datura alone is almost guaranteed to result in injury/death.  You not only put yourself in danger, but others who come into contact with you.  
If more people are going to take it, you need 1 tripsitter per person.  They must all be physically capable of restraining everyone who is taking it.  ****DO NOT TAKE DATURA ALONE****

There is a decent chance you can injest too much datura and become critically ill.  Your sober trip sitter must be familiar with the signs of an overdose and be ready to respond to a medical emergency.  Have the address of where you are written down, have multiple cell phones to call 911, and tell the paramedics EVERYTHING.  DO NOT LIE.  They need to know what happened so they can admister proper treatment.  Let your tripsitter know any allergies/ medical conditions you have so he can communicate this to emergency services.  This will help you survive a potentially fatal event.

I recommend before taking datura, that you read ALL the trip reports of it on erowid.  This will hopefully show you that this will not be fun.  Some of the trip reports sound like they came straight out of a horror film.  This will give you an idea of what to expect, but you WILL not be ready.

The actual effects of datura vary by potency, dosage, and the person taking it.  Your mileage may vary.  Typically, you will feel the effects within 45-mins to an hour.  You will feel uncomfortable, and nervous, like something is wrong.  You will also develop severe dry mouth and a need to urinate even when you can't.  Have some water with you to help keep your mouth moist.  After this, you will start to see shit.  This is not a typical psychedelic hallucination.  You will see things that are completely indistinguishable from reality.  You will forget you took datura.  You will phase in and out of awareness of your surroundings.  Common hallucinations are seeing people who aren't there, you will hear people talking, noises that can't be explained.  If you look in the mirror, it's very likely you won't see yourself.  99% of the time, this is not fun.  You will be scared, confused and panic.  These hallucinations are sinister, and feel evil.  You will be in different areas in your head than you actually are.  You will see things that are nonsensical but make complete sense to you in that moment. This will put much stress on your body.  Be prepared to be taken to the hospital if necessary. I recommend keeping some benzos on hand if accessable, but make sure only your trip sitter has access to them and can administer them if you wish to take them.  This may alleviate some of the stress and fear that you WILL endure, but there is no guarentee.  This is a very powerful substance.

This is totally unsubstantiated, but based off of my very crude and poor understanding of pharmacology, wikipedia claims these substances can help reduce the affects of a datura overdose/nightmare trip because they are cholinergics:

*  ""Reversible Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents such as physostigmine can be used as an antidote in life-threatening cases.""

*  ""Piracetam (and other racetams), α-GPC and choline are known to activate the cholinergic system and alleviate cognitive symptoms caused by extended use of anticholinergic drugs.""

There are notorious after affects of a datura trip, that can last weeks to even months.  The most common is blurry vision, inability to focus your eyes, confusion, foggy headedness, and persistent hallucinations.  Be ready to deal with this.

Well, I'll edit and add to this as I recieve criticism and useful info given by the commentors of this post.  This guide is in no way complete or substantial.  Do much more research on datura before attempting it.  I really hope you never do, and I hope I managed to change someones mind.",35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ak3h20/datura_harm_reduction_guide/

31085,Synthetic Cannabimimetic,Bad spice trip questions,"Back in 2012, I got some diablo spice from this local head shop. loaded it into a pipe and took a couple hits from it.

My significant other tried calming me down and stuff, but i would look at something and it was as if my vision would zoom in and out of an object.  


Anyways, the purpose of this post was to ask a question that i've been wondering ever since, and haven't found an answer on it. During the peak(the whole trip felt like a constant peak that seemed to never reach a peak but was increasing with no end in sight) I would feel these...what felt like electrical shocks that would go from my head to my toes. Was a pulsating feeling that would come in waves. I'm wondering what that sensation is, maybe it was due to the anxiety of certain death around the corner? wondering if anyone has any insight. I would smoke weed throughout the year afterwards and would get these shocks as a sort of flashback at times. The sensation is gone now thank goodness, when getting high, but I am very prone to anxiety nowadays on the come up every time i take psilocybin, which sucks and could very well be perfectly normal as it is very powerful.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ak4iyo/bad_spice_trip_questions/

31256,I :love: Drugs,Do you think that drugs expand the mind or uncover things that were always there but otherwise kept from the forefront of the mind?,"This is more of a discussion since I'm sure the answer is clear. (If it's not, someone can definitely jump in.)

Before I begin, I would like to apologize for any typos. I tend to make a lot of them in general but it's even worse since I'm on adderall and my mind is going a mile a minute. Phew! lol

&amp;#x200B;

So, I feel like drugs create these connections in our brains that were not initially there prior to the drug use and that's what gives us the impression that we are wiser/smarter, more confident, more attractive, etc. It makes me wonder how extensive the mind is- like what its limit is. Because there were times that I took psychedelics (LSD mostly and one time shrooms) and my mind became VERY expansive- as is the effect of the drugs- and I came up with theories of life and became deeply introspective. I also, very recently during an acid trip realized how confident I can be if I just let go of people's opinions of myself and be comfortable in my own skin.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes me wish that I could think the way that I do when on some of these drugs while sober as well. I looked into some videos that explain what's going on in the brain so it seems like we all have the capability to some extent but the minds while sober stays in this defaulted, less complex form. If you think about it, this is probably a better form to be in day in day out because having so many thoughts flood your mind would make you almost unable to perform tasks and remember important things and your brain would burn out. 

&amp;#x200B;

But using your brain to its utmost capability isn't a default... Or is it that we choose not to use our minds to the fullest extent. We're animals of simplicity and are always trying to find the easier route to things. Most of us would rather plug and extensive equation into our calculators rather than spend almost an hour writing out each step (unless we REALLY like math or something.). We rely on technology to do the dirty work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I trying to figure out what I'm wanting to ask here... I guess what I want to know is if there's a limit to the human mind. Are we ever going to hit a brick wall or are out neural abilities infinite like the universe? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm always surprised by what drugs can do to them and how they can change people. I've definitely changed- changed for the better (I hope) by learning about how life works and how I work. It's just fascinating. I know the government makes some of these drugs like weed, acid, etc. illegal as shit because of how much it expands the mind. You can't fool someone that is well versed and well read and ""woke"", so it makes sense that the drugs are labeled as illicit and bad.

31296,GABAergics,GHB and Phenibut,"I started using phenibut a few months ago and it had incredible effects. From September to December I used it 2-3 times a week. Once the semester ended I stopped using it as often, had it maybe once a week or less, but now that spring semester is starting up I plan on using it more frequently (but still only a couple times per week as recommended) as it's a godsend for my social anxiety.

On the other hand, I've been an alcoholic for many years, and I'm getting pretty sick of drinking. Everything I have read about GHB indicates that it would be a great replacement for alcohol, so I got my hands on a small amount to experiment with. (Please spare me any lecturing about how replacing alcohol with GHB is bad in the long run and I need to get sober - I know this, I'm not ready for 100% sobriety yet.) 

From what I understand, both GHB and phenibut are depressants that act on GABA-B receptors. Believe me I have no intention of using both at the exact same time - that sounds as dangerous as mixing GHB and alcohol. But I am still interested in trying to use both on a weekly basis. What would be a safe dosing regimen? Since GHB seems to stay in the system for a short period of time, would it be safe to take GHB at night and then take phenibut the following morning? I know phenibut stays in your body a lot longer - would it be ok to take phenibut in the morning, and wait until the following night to take GHB? Basically, is there anyway I could safely use both within the same week in any configuration or is it just too risky and I should just focus on one at a time?

I haven't tried oxycodone and was thinking of trying it on a special occasion, but need to know if its worth it and enjoyable.

Are oxys recreational when taken orally? Is there a high? Is 20mg a good dose for this purpose?

&amp;#x200B;

Also does anyone have any experience with Targins? I've read the naxalone is an opioid antagonist however does not get activated when taken orally.

31436,Psychedelics,Friktal: On the way to become the first schedule one software product?,"I've been working on a desktop and VR game the last couple years which feeds dozens of narrow bands of audio data directly into dozens of mathematical parameters of 3d fractal math -- allowing gamers to grab a controller and fly through fractal worlds as it beats, morphs and flows directly to their music. What started as a game concept has morphed into something more.

&amp;#x200B;

I often ask for feedback from early testers as the product, Friktal, hasn't been released yet. Numerous testers have made comments referencing how their brain on substance x, y or z is so similar to mode x, y, or z in Friktal. So much so that many users have thought we should name the modes based on which psychedelic experience it most reminds them of (not something we are doing). The comments have made me chuckle... One recent one made me chuckle then cringe.

&amp;#x200B;

""Friktal may very well be the first schedule one software product""

&amp;#x200B;

At first it really was a haha. And then I paused. Thought about how ridiculous the notion is then about how absolutely trance enduing, mental state altering, and perspective shifting the software has been just to myself as I have developed it. I have found myself drop hours by mistake just testing out a new fractal setup as I get mentally lost in the world, watch the math take an unexpected turn simply by a change of music genre. I have often entered meditative and trance like states testing the game. I have to set timers for myself as a reminder to stop 'testing' and get back to work. And I thought about where the project is going...

&amp;#x200B;

I has grabbed attention from researchers for things like feeding EEG (brainwave) data into the math. Art-projects like putting dancers on stage with their bodies in motion capture suits with the body motion-data dancing the fractal math... Feeding weather pattern data into it... or the frequencies of pulsars... humans capture a ton of data about many things these days. And one researcher wanting to run an IQ study to see if Friktal usage over time will unlock the mind in a measurable way -- could it up an IQ through frequent use?

&amp;#x200B;

Now what seems like a compliment of an excited gamer takes on a bit deeper of a question. When you step back a little and look at scheduling of some substances, we have plants. I'm sure at some point many people thought ""How funny... a notion that a government would say which plants I can consume and which ones I can not"". There is so much fear around altered states of consciousness. So much association between altered states and ""Druggie No Good Deadbeat Kids"" or some such manufactured fear based nonsense. And seeing Friktal (and maybe others?) as the start of software-assisted-altered-states (YAY SAAS... a new acronym). Is it honestly all that crazy to think that software could some day be a target of scheduling for the same reasons as some plants and the chemicals they contain which assist the human brain in shifting perceptions? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few quotes from early testers which underline the association of drugs and software experience:

&amp;#x200B;

""Well done. You found a way to record my brain on drugs and let me go explore my poor life decisions in gorgeous detail.""

""You need to sell this in little plastic baggies at $25 a hit""

""Realtalk. Weed's legal in some places now. It's time for a new genre of games for us stoners. Long live Friktal. ""

""This is proof humanity has hit AI singularity and our new god is talking to me through the music-driven fractal math""

""At times it really feels like a window into alternate dimensions and perceptions of reality. Like I'm a human voyeur watching an inter-dimensional orgy. ""

""I enjoy seeing a dragon in the randomness of a cloud but in Friktal the dragon is dancing and auroras pulse from the sun's reflection on his scales.""

""It's like being in the psychedelic larynx of a cosmic opera singer""

It's about a psychedelics dealer named Kurt who is descending into heroin addiction as a result of his recently ex-girlfriends' being raped and subsequent suicide attempt. Kurt eventually goes to attempt to dose his ex's rapist with tens of thousands of mics of LSD and attempt to torture him psychologically. If you guys wanna know how it ends lmk, there's a bit of a twist at the ending. It's roughly based on my own real-life experience (minus the drug dealing, that just added an element of paranoia to the character which I liked).

&amp;#x200B;

An uncomfortably high-pitched beeping blared from the alarm clock sitting on the bedside table. In the span of a single second the alarm was silenced with a resentful slap and stillness retook the bed’s occupant. There was no rush, the alarm that he had once again forgotten to turn off the night before was intended for the days he had to get up and go to class, and as of last Monday those days were over. Following the initial shock and subsequent feelings of intense hatred, the man lying in the bed actually derived pleasure from the intrusion into his sleep. It reminded him of when he was in middle school and would set the alarm an hour before he had to wake up, just so he could consciously realize that he had another hour of sleep to look forward to. This realization sent waves of relaxation and contentment through his body and mind, and the euphoria of this alone was his reasoning for orchestrating it every weekday morning.

He stared at the tapestry pinned to the ceiling above his bed, a photo-realistic image of a starry night-sky with tall, slender trees forming a vignette around the sparkled heavens. He could not, for the life of him, determine what day it was, and after about a minute of debating he dropped the issue altogether. It didn’t really matter anyway. Suddenly, the cell phone sitting next to the alarm clock began to ring its cheery tune. The man sighed, rubbed the gunk from his eyes, sat up on the edge of the bed and answered the call.

“Yo,” said Kurt, his voice still raspy from lack of use.

“Hey, I need a strip,” said the voice on the other end.

“Got you, where you at?”

“My apartment.”

“Where’s that again?”

“For real Kurt? You were here like two days ago. I’ll just text you the address.”

“Cool, I’ll-,” Kurt cuts himself short as he realizes that the call has ended.

He put the phone back down beside the alarm clock and reached into the already open drawer of his nightstand. He removed a small baggie which contained a very fine brown powder. After some searching, he managed to find the snuff spoon, which had fallen under the bed. Kurt opened the baggie, dipped the spoon in and scooped a rather large bump relative to the tiny spoon which carried it. Without hesitation he sniffed it up, dipped it in for a second time and quickly sniffed that up as well. He rubbed his nose and paused to pay special attention to the flow of physical and psychological relief he began to experience running through him. This flow rushed over him and a smile manifested for only a second.

He sniffed a pair of socks he had found on the ground as if to insure they were indeed safe to wear, put it on, and placed the baggie with the spoon into the left sock. He made his way over to his closet, knelt down near the back and felt under a pile of clothes for a wooden box, about the size of a shoe box, but greater in length and substance. He removed the lid and rummaged through several zip-lock baggies containing various crystals, powders, mushrooms and rocks, and opened one containing several squares of tin foil, all about the size of his palm. After taking a square out of the baggie he began unwrapping it to reveal a vibrantly decorated sheet of paper which was perforated into smaller squares, some of which were already missing. He tore a strip of ten tabs off the sheet, reached into the inside pocket of a coat that was hanging above him and placed the strip of paper into the tiny baggie he had removed from it.

He stood up and exited the closet, placed the baggie deep inside his other sock, put on the clothes he wore yesterday and the day before, and made his way to the door of his apartment. Just as he was about to open it, he stopped, held up his finger and mumbled to himself with a slight smile,

“Nearly forgot.”

He retreated back into his room and began packing a bowl for the bong sitting on one of his old philosophy text books. He relished the ritual of smoking almost as much as the resulting high. The process of selecting the perfect nugget from the stash, breaking it up and grinding it into a spongey, porous dust, which is then sprinkled into the bowl and packed tightly. The act of placing the mouth of the piece against your own and inhaling as the flame dancing before your eyes is pulled down into the sparkling mound of green, gradually scorching black, then blazing red down to the bottom of the bowl until all that remains is white and grey ash.

Watching the smoke as he carefully exhales, Kurt leans back in his chair as a squirrel catches his attention through his window. It has an acorn in its mouth, moving here and there among the leaves, in search of the ideal hiding spot for its newfound treasure. Kurt pondered the level of consciousness the squirrel experienced. It must have some stream of consciousness dictating where it ought to hide its acorn. It takes in stimuli using its senses and then derives meaning from said stimuli to determine its action, just like humans. Maybe the squirrel itself is not conscious of this process, but the process must be happening nonetheless. Kurt then considered whether humans are truly conscious of their own process of perception or whether our conceptions of said process are even close to the reality of the thing. It’s like trying to understand what your own eyeballs look like while using the very subject of your examination, it’s impossible without some external tool, like a mirror.

Lost in thought, Kurt suddenly realized the squirrel had left his field of vision and he was staring off into space. He came back to reality, loaded up and burned another bowl, much more quickly than he had the first, and made his way towards the door. Once again, he stopped short and turned back to his room. He walked across it to his nightstand, opened the drawer and withdrew a multi-colored steel pocket knife, about the size of his hand. He left his room and finally made it to the door, as ready as he would ever be.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ak7axx/an_excerpt_the_beginning_of_a_short_story_i_wrote/

31603,Stimulants,"The worst night of my life, or, how I overdosed on research stimulants for the first time. (warning, vomit)","TLDR: I took obscure stimulants hoping to have fun and watch a movie, got destroyed by them and went to the ER. lots of vomiting throughout the whole thing.

It all started with my friend, who kept on telling me how often he uses stimulants like preworkout and ritalin to go to the gym, how it's the best thing ever and how focused and energized it makes him. He and I talk about drug research often, and I'm pretty sure he browses this subreddit. He tells me the brand of preworkout that he uses, so I look it up and research each single one of the assorted weird ass stimulants in it. For some reason, I ignore all of the bad side effects and get really excited about the positive effects of the stims that I already pretty much knew. Wow, euphoria and stimulation. sounds good, as long as I don't get any nausea, hallucinations, itchy sensations, irritability, vision problems, panic attacks or psychosis. which, of course I won't, because I'm invincible! Up to this point, I had never tried stimulants before, but I was otherwise well versed in the world of drugs. I have this friday off and my parents are out, so why not invite my friend over to take some preworkout and watch a movie?

When he comes over and it is time to take the preworkout, I make 2 major mistakes. my first mistake: I was really hungry and had not eaten anything for 6 hours. thinking that the preworkout would hit me super hard if I did not eat, I ate a large burger, a whole thing of fries and a shake right before consuming the powder. This did not help with the nausea. my second mistake was taking a fuckton of it. he said that one scoop was his normal dose, and I, forgetting that he takes this stuff really often, weights about 100 pounds more than me, and actually exercises, thought that this was an okay dose for me.

I take it and set a stopwatch on my phone, like I always do when I take drugs, and we put on some stand up comedy. 5 minutes later I feel kind of extra focus. 20 minutes later my entire back and my legs start itching like crazy. I tell him about it and he says ""yeah, that's like one of my favorite parts of taking stims"" (weirdo) I fight the urge to take off my shirt and roll around on the carpet to relieve my itching urges, and about 20 minutes later i am having a full on anxious episode. I do not want to be in this social situation, I just want to be alone, but I was also scared to move from the couch for some reason, so I just sit there being nervous.

1 hour after taking the preworkout my stomach starts rumbling. I stand up for the first time since taking it to get a water bottle. walking around was kind of disorienting, it was like my body was moving out of sync with my mind. The room started spinning and then my stomach felt like it was getting stabbed, so I ran to the bathroom, and knelt there for 10 minutes throwing up. I go back downstairs and tell him that I threw up, and he says, ""yeah, I read online that someone took this preworkout right after eating fast food and threw up for 3 hours straight LMAO"" my stomach was no longer bothering me for now, so I continue to watch stand up. my stomach starts hurting more than last time some how, so again, i go to the bath room. this time, i throw up twice as much as last time, and each time I throw up it seems like it is bigger than the last time. I walk downstairs and tell him to leave because I'm sick, which he does. afterwards, I sit in the bathroom for an hour throwing up and feeling miserable. every time I throw up it alleviates the pain for like 5 minutes and it just comes back. After an hour of continual vomiting I just decide to get into bed with a bucket and ride it out. Then my parents come home.

I tell them that I was drinking instead of doing research chemicals, which was believable for them at first, but then...they find the baggy of white powder...that my friend left here when he left... what the fuck. I come clean about what it is, and they're obviously disappointed and mad, but I was looking really flushed and sick, not to mention throwing up loudly every 5 minutes, so they have some sympathy for now. They look up the brand of preworkout and the side effects of it, and read through the symptoms of overdose for it, which included nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, hyperventilating, and hallucinations. I was 5 for 5. they called poison control and told them this, and they said to get me to the ER ASAP. I had to get out of bed and walk to the car, bringing a bag for vomit (if I thought I was sick before when I was staying still in bed, imagine me on a bumpy road in a moving car. I threw up at least 3 times, and it was quite a short ride) we get there and a guy checks my heart rate, blood pressure, etc. I get hooked up to an EKG and a saline iv drip, and when this happened, it finally set in that I actually overdosed on stimulants. It was 12 AM when we got there, and I took the stuff at 7, so it should mostly be out of my system by now, right? nope. My mom and I were there till 445. My stomach was getting better, I hadn't thrown up since 1, and I slept for 2 hours while I was waiting, so overall, successful hospital visit. When we finally got home, I hopped right into bed and slept for 11 hours. When I woke up, I was still visually and physically disoriented, and my stomach still hurt, Albeit less than it did earlier. I had to actually force down saltine crackers as my only source of food, but by the time the second of doing nothing came to a close, my stomach ceased its tumult and everything went baaaack to normal. Mostly. My hunger isn't back to what it should be, and I still feel disoriented. The friend that supplied the preworkout still hasn't called or texted me to check up on me, which is weird considering I was throwing up as he was leaving my house. The end.

31901,Alprazolam,Travis Scott concert on Xanax + alcohol + weed,"So me and my girlfriend drove to dallas to the astroworld concert back in November. I’m a recovering drug addict and she knows so i have to hide my drug use from her. I brought one 2mg alprazolam bar with me for the concert. When we got our Airbnb while she was getting ready I took half the bar. I’m very experienced with drugs, I’ve been to two rehab programs in the past 2 years and I’m 22 years old. I’m finishing my degree in finance now. I’m honestly fucked up off some Valium and alcohol rn as I’m writing this at a coffee shop doing homework and thought fuck it might as well write down this experience. She’s an amazing person and fucking loves me and is completely against me using drugs but I’m a fucking addict. 

Back to the story. After I took half the bar we both took 3 shots of some crown apple and I was vibin. When we got in the Uber to the American Airlines center I was talking the Uber drivers ear off and I knew she knew I was on something but she was also kind of drunk and didn’t say anything at the time. When we were walking in I was stumbling and slurring my words and she was surprised i was already drunk off 3 shots. When we got inside I got us both 2 mixed drinks and i finished mine before we even got to the floor. I still had half of my school bus left and I was standing by this guy and told him I’ll give him half a bar if he let me chief on his dab pen. He obviously agreed. After about 5 or 6 hits I was feeling fuuuckkkkedddd. I told my girlfriend I needed to go use the restroom. I fell up the stairs going to the restroom and was bumping into people and they didn’t know what the fuck was wrong with me. When i got to the restroom I was banging my head on the wall in front of the urinal and this guy asked if I was okay and I replied “bro I’m cool I’m just vibin” and he brought me some water. Nice guy. I drank the water then headed to the bar. Threw back a shot of Bombay sapphire then after that I couldn’t walk a straight line to save my life. A police officer came up to me and said if i don’t get my shit together he was going to arrest me for public intox. I couldn’t remember which entrance I came from. I found a family bathroom and went in to go piss again and to sit down to try and pull myself together. I sat down at 730 then next thing I knew it was 1145. I was blacked out in the bathroom for fucking 4 hours. I couldn’t get ahold of my girlfriend and somehow I walked 3 miles back to my Airbnb and my girlfriend was there crying. She left the concert early and almost called the police cause she thought I had disappeared or was hurt. It’s probably the most fucked up thing I’ve ever done and I feel horrible about it. 

I fucking hate drugs so much but my god I can’t keep myself from using. She is 6 weeks pregnant now and I’m fucking freaking out.

31927,Methamphetamine,Weed and Meth: a meandering post about theoretical computer science,"Weed and meth is a seriously underrated combination. I think this combo isn't that popular because each one attracts a certain kind of crowd, and there's not usually a lot of overlap between the two. But it's great. It gives you the creativity and patience that comes with weed and also the focus and obsessive behavior that comes with meth. The result is that you are massively interested in everything and you are actually mentally sharp enough to learn.

I've been thinking about self-studying mathematics for a while now. I've always liked learning math, but it was also always one of the harder subjects to get good grades in for me. I studied mechanical engineering and computer science in college, so I did a fair bit of higher math, but I never touched the really interesting stuff that only math majors get to like abstract algebra and analysis and advanced geometry.

I was reading about object-oriented programming and was writing some Java, and I started thinking about objects and data structures and what they really are. In Java, you have stuff like ArrayLists and HashMaps and Graphs and all kinds of data structures. But what are these data structures really? What am I doing when I type to create one while programming?

In theoretical computer science, ""abstract data types"" are mathematical objects. They are basically a collection of values, the rules between those values, and what actions you can perform on those values. Data structures are the physical implementations of these mathematical objects, written digitally in a syntax like Java that people can understand and represented physically when the code is compiled into bits and stored using voltage in your computer memory (RAM). I started reading Wikipedia pages about the analogous concept in pure mathematics, which is algebraic structures, and, much to my surprise, I was actually understanding some of it. I think I might buy a textbook on it and see if I can handle it. It seems like really interesting, mind-bending stuff.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ak9fy3/weed_and_meth_a_meandering_post_about_theoretical/

32038,I :love: Drugs,Has any one reached this point?,"I’m 28 years old, over the last 7 years I’ve used every substance under the sun. Some heavier than others but always something. For 5 years I smoked weed/dabs every day all day, even had my medical card. Didn’t think I could ever live with out it. Drinking regularly, ketamine whenever I can find it, Coke 3/5x a month. Rolled about 80 times(in 7 years don’t recommend that). Any pain pills I can find.  I just accepted I’m the type of person who needs “something” to get by. That was my destiny. 

Then slowly this thought started nagging at me that all this shit is just a giant crutch, and that overall it’s making me feel like shit physically and mentally. Like an endless cycle of shit feelings and filling the hole with more shit. And it bothered me.  Don’t get me wrong, I’ve learned so much about life and philosophy and had memorable experiences from drugs. But just decided slowly that im fucking over it all.

I started quitting weed on my own, then went and got a union job so no more weed even if I wanted too, been 18 months and though I miss it I know I’m better off. Memory is sharp, motivation better.

Started exercising almost every day on top of work. Feel so much more energized and focused at work.  quit nicotine, and haven’t had a drink in 28 days. And it feels fucking amazing. It took so long to get here but I’m glad I’m here. 

Don’t get me wrong, it’s not easy. I get mad cravings for all kinds of shit, but it passes. I still occasionally take some boomers or a hit of L(once a month maybe). Maybe some Kratom 2x3 a month. But holy shit, cutting all that other stuff out helps so much mentally.

Monday same deal except 4mg because I took 20mg of Adderall pretty late in the day (6pm) and wanted to pass out at 3am after good studying and 2mg still had me lying in bed thinking stimmed up thoughts just calm and without the euphoria. Cumulative-Sum(6mg)

Tuesday: nil / Cumulative-Sum(6mg)

Wednesday: 
Took 1mg recreationally after lecture and after hitting the gym to shoot the shit with my friend at the mall. Talking with random mall passerbys, hitting on/picking up girls, bantering with people eating beside us at the food court, and with retail employees and basically just being super dgaf and social. 

(Wouldn't call myself a bartard at all as I'm a final year university student about to graduate with distinction, am already a very social/outgoing/socially dominant confident person vs on etiz talking to people becomes even easier than normal (which is a given considering how the drug works in the brain)) People enjoyed talking to us and we gave off good vibes. Got back home and took some crushed up Ritalin sublingually to get some work done and cancel out the prior 1mg etiz then another 1mg of etizolam to pass out. Daily Sum: 2mg, CumSum: 8

Thursday: Woke up feeling pretty sick but not from etizolam but I could feel early onset cold/flu from shovelling the driveway twice the day before and going for a run in inappropriate clothing in the early morning Wednesday. No desire to take etizolam or whatever even though I had a networking event with employers looking for new business grads in 4 months. Killed it and got some contacts then went home and the sickness hit full force. Said fuck it my school week is done and it's been a while, downed 350mg of DXM with 1mg of etiz as low dose benzos counteract most if not all neurotoxicity of of DXM. Then another 1mg to pass out at trips end. Daily: 2mg, Cumsum: 10mg

Friday: Woke up full force flu and cold and had a terrible day overall and then took another 4mg of etiz to KO at night, Daily 4mg, Total, 14mg

Today: 50mg of vyvanse to fight through the cold/flu and be able to study and not be bedridden with a ritalin booster later on, took 4mg just now ready to KO. Daily:4mg, Total: 18mg

I have another 10mg left or so in case the withdrawals are really bad and to taper down fast but I think I'll be okay given I feel 10/10 in the mornings this week aside from when I was sick and am super social still and not depressed or anxious and super productive and have mainly been using it as a sleep aid if at albeit higher doses need to sleep.

I'm out of adderall for the next 2 weeks and the flu should be gone or very manageable by tomorrow morning so this is the end of etizolam for at least 1-2 weeks until I get the adderall re-up.

What does the week ahead have in store for me?

32064,Go To Bed,"In case some of you weren't totally in the loop, sleep is more important than you think. Really.","I see posts here all the time of psychosis and schizophrenic episodes from drug induced binges, people having bad trips or just really not feeling good.

Sleeping is not just something you do to get more energy or rest your muscles, it literally keeps you from going insane. The effects of long term sleep deprivation or short term total lack of sleep are actually not very different. Your mind has to work extremely hard to keep working when you are awake.

I dont need to tell you to get sleep, or what the effect of not sleeping enough  are. You already know.

What i do want to tell you? Don't do drugs, especially psychedelics and stimulants when you are overtired. You might think ""okay, makes sense for psychedelics but isn't the point of a stimulant to keep you awake and alert?""

Your mind becomes increasingly less capable of dealing with anxieties and stressful input when you are tired. Combine this with a drug that already amplifies your anxiety and stress, bad shit happens (like a psychosis). I've never been a user of stimulants for this reason because they give you an innaccurate sense of how grounded you are by just providing energy and preventing you from sleeping.

Even on my most hardcore and irresponsible poly drug sessions i still factor in time to sleep. Never, ever aim to stay awake for more than 48 hours straight whilst still dosing drugs. Even the most sane and healthy person will begin to lose their grip after this time.

If you really want to avoid being one of those people who become a horror story (""My cousin did acid once and now he is in a mental hospital"") and not further stigmatize other drug users then *get some goddamn sleep*",288,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aka64p/in_case_some_of_you_werent_totally_in_the_loop/

32127,Stimulants,First time Adderall (mixed Amphetamine Sulfate),"I crushed up a 20 mg XR and dissolved it in a bit of water then put it under my tongue, it didn't taste half bad actually. At first I did feel stimulation, but only for perhaps an hour or two, then it was all just a cool, calm, and content feeling. I was able to get up and do things whenever I wanted to (unlike normal, I have serious motivational issues) but I could also just chill and listen to music, and I found myself perfectly OK with just sitting still and watching the boiling flask full of methanol bubbling away on my desk (distilling it as part of a project). Overall a rather pleasant time but nothing exhilarating or intense like I had expected going in (probably a good thing?). 

&amp;#x200B;

I originally intended to go to a party and socialize and really get a feel for stimulants in a social setting (second time on a stim ever) and instead I found myself tidying up my room, finishing up some projects I had meant to do, and generally being off in my own world of contentment, not really caring too much about the party that I was missing. I've felt better than this before while sober but for me to get to that point it usually requires a fair amount of mental hype and effort along with some good music. With Adderall I was feeling a chill version of that state without the work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely got quite a bit done, and all I had to do was think ""OK now this is going to get done"" and I was able to get up and do it, no hint of boredom which often plagues me as I try to work on things. The thing that keeps getting me is that during the whole duration of the experience, I didn't feel like I had extra energy, I didn't feel compelled to work, things just came naturally. I really didn't feel too different than I do on a good day when I wake up early after a good night's sleep and eat a nice breakfast then start listening to some tunes. I certainly wouldn't describe myself as high, just ""feeling pretty pleasant."" Frankly my favorite part about the whole thing was feeling content without it feeling ""foreign"" as it typically does with drugs like weed and acid. I enjoyed a mood lift without an intelligence debuff and I guess that sort of thing is why I got curious about stims in the first place. Good times that I can remember clearly ya know?

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, Addy is a pretty pleasant relaxed feeling for me. Hardly a high in my opinion but certainly a nice afternoon. While this wasn't intense, nor was it mind-blowing for me, my brain is already calculating how to get more of this stuff and I think it would be best if I kept the usage of this stuff confined to rare occasions, as addiction is definitely nothing to fuck around with. While I am sure y'all would get a laugh out of me posting stories about IV'ng meth in Taco Bell then fapping in the booth or fighting wars with shadow people using Raid, I doubt my life would be very together if I got to that point, nor do I think I could survive shit like that for very long being the lightweight fuck I am.

32280,Stimulants,"What long term damage am I doing, if any, by taking orally 1 (possibly 2) moderate doses of speed per week?","I've always suffered from drowsiness. When I'm at work, I'm fine, but on my days off I love to chill at home and read. I LOVE reading, but I will usually always find it difficult to stay awake when reading, I will always have to take a nap, no matter how much sleep I got the night before. Sometimes I have to take 2 or 3 naps in a day, and I'm more tired than ever at the end of it. If I'm out and about doing something, or with friends I'm fine, it only affects me when I am home chilling.

I tried speed for the first time a month ago, since then I have been taking a single moderate dose on saturday morning at around 10am, and it has just been a revelation. Last weekend, was the most reading I got done in a single weekend in more than 10 years I would say. And I got a load of other stuff done besides. Its a radical change from my usual weekends which I would be sleeping during most of, and get nothing done.

It would be great if I could do this once a weekend, is it feasible?

I know one of the greatest risks is that I will get addicted and want to start doing speed 4, 5, or 6 days a week, with larger and larger doses.

But lets say for arguments sake I CAN stick to one or two moderate doses per week, what are the dangers?

As for the dosage I have been taking, the speed I have is quite impure, but I would guess it amounts to 30-50mg

I've also ordered some modafinil, gonna see if that will give me the same feelings of alertness as speed, as that would surely be a safer alternative. Any other suggestions? What about ritalin?

32301,Long Post,My ultimate guide to Adderall,"I've tried pretty much all the stims except a few RCs, but my DOC is Adderall, it's the best high I can get that is reasonably affordable and readily available to me. I've been using it off and on for 11 years. The show I was at is over and I'm at home high on Adderall right now so I figured I'd post a guide to share the full extent of my Adderall knowledge. 

**Adderall IR Oral Dosage**(assuming no tolerance to stims)

10mg IR: Good dose for productivity, gives a nice buzz but not highly euphoric, very easy to focus on it and enjoy mundane tasks. 

20mg IR: Ideal first time dose IMO. Moderate euphoria, lots of stimulation without too many side effects. Can be used to enhance a party or to get shit done, massively increases confidence and motivation.

30-40mg IR: Highly euphoric and stimulating, feels amazing but I'd advise only taking this dose for partying, the euphoria will cause you to lose focus and waste time on random BS if you just take it at home, can also be anxiety inducing for people who are sensitive to stimulants. 

50mg+ IR:Not recommended if you don't have some stimulant tolerance, can be really fun if you can handle it, but muscle tension, anxiety, and comedown will be a lot worse. Worst side effect is usually panic attacks and teeth grinding. 

100mg+:Not recommended without a high tolerance, there isn't  much risk of deadly OD since LD50 is around 1400mg, however it could still be dangerous if you have heart problems or allow yourself to get dehydrated or overheated. At this dose it's possible to cause psychosis in susceptible people. Almost guaranteed to be dysphoric and not at all fun for someone with no tolerance. 

Onset: 30-60 min

Duration: 4-6 hour high with residual stimulation that can last another 4-6 hours. 

Snorted IR: Effects are similar at 50-75% of the oral doses, duration is around half the time. 

**Adderall XR:** The way this works is it has time release beads in a capsule. Half releases instantly, the other half is dissolved by your stomach acid after about 3-4 hours. Some people find this preferable when using it for work or school as it's a bit smoother experience. Effectively you get half the high per dose and twice the duration. You can make it the same as oral IR by using a mortar and pestle or any improvised device that will let you crush the beads into a fine powder, it can then be put back in the capsule or parachuted.

**Snorting XR:**I find it's not ideal for snorting even when finely crushed, it will work to an extent, but you're snorting a ton of mostly inert, not very water soluble powder relative to the amount of amphetamine. A lot of it will definitely get stuck in your nose, if you must take it this way snorting a little bit of saline nasal spray or distilled water will help increase effects, but a lot of it will either drip down your throat and work the same as oral, or you will just have globs of orange snot running out your nose and wasting more of the drug. Besides the annoyance of snorting that much powder I'd say you get 50-75% of the effects you would from an oral dose or snorted IR dose.

**positive effects:**

* Greatly increased energy, confidence and motivation

* Euphoria

* Increased focus at low-moderate doses

* Increased tactile sensations 

* Everything is more fun and enjoyable

**negative effects:**

* Anxiety and insomnia during the comedown

* Muscle tension and soreness

* Depression and fatigue the following day(s), especially at higher doses

* Reduced or no appetite

* Teeth grinding (higher doses)

* Muscle spasms (higher doses, or related to dehydration)

* Makes you horny but causes ED or trouble getting off for many men, especially at higher doses

**Getting the most out of your high/reducing comedown**

You should always eat something first, towards the end you will feel discomfort from hunger but food might still seem repulsive, if you can stomach something you should try to eat, smoothies and cold fruit tend to be pretty agreeable. Being well rested is also important. If your body is rested and has the nutrients it needs you will get a better high and less side effects. 

Reducing the acidity of your stomach will make amphetamines more effective, some people take baking soda or tums with varying degrees of success. Vitamin C and acidic drinks will have the opposite effect, can be useful if you want to come down and sleep. Stay hydrated, sugary sports drinks are ideal, avoid drinking too much caffeine.

For the comedown If weed doesn't give you anxiety it can be great for helping you eat and sleep, high CBD strains especially. Benzos are the ultimate cure for overstimulation and comedowns, around 1mg Xanax or equivalent is ideal. As far as OTC drugs go Diphenhydramine will help you sleep, just limit your dose to around 50mg, tripping on Benadryl during a stim comedown is a terrible idea so don't overdo it. 

**Drug interactions**

* **Prescriptions:** Use an online interaction checker, too many to list here, a few of them can alter it or be dangerous. 

* **All other stimulants:** Avoid, increased side effects and higher risk. (Edit. Except nicotine, it does increase negative side effects a little, but good luck trying not to chain smoke on Adderall if you're a smoker)

* **Weed:** Excellent combo for most people, takes more to get stoned but can reduce side effects and get you baked without the sleepiness. May cause increased anxiety for some.

* **Opiates:** Dangerous mix, proceed with caution. Increased chance of OD as you will feel reduced effects until the Adderall wears off. 

* **LSD/Shrooms:** Uncomfortable for most people, much higher chance of bad trips, panic attacks, etc.

* **Benzos:** Reduces it's effects, good for coming down.

* **Alcohol** Goes well with a couple drinks but will make you feel less drunk and increase dehydration and hangover. Not good to drink heavily on Adderall. 

* **Nicotine** If you're a smoker this shit will make you chain smoke like crazy, make sure you have plenty of smokes, same with vaping. If you vape get a lower mg juice, you will want to hit it non stop and can make yourself nicotine sick.  

**Supplements**

I've seen a lot of supplements recommended, these are my personal experiences with them. 

Chelated magnesium: Helps with teeth grinding/clenching

Magnesium citrate/oxide: Doesn't work like the chelated stuff and will probably give you the shits. 

L-Arginine: This definitely helps with vasoconstriction, only need it for binges or high doses typically. 

Melatonin: Helps a little bit with getting to sleep, can come in clutch if you don't have a benzo to make you sleep

L-Theanine: Seems to moderately reduce anxiety and jitteriness, next best option if you can't get a benzo 

Acetyl-l-Carnitine: As far as I can tell it doesn't do shit

L-Tyrosine: Helps replenish dopamine, taken the day after it reduces depression, really only necessary if you abuse it heavily

B complex/multivitamin: This won't really do anything for the casual user, but if you heavily abuse the drug and aren't eating right this will reduce issues caused by vitamin deficiencies 

**Tolerance and addiction**

Adderall tolerance increases rapidly, to achieve the same high you have to increase your dose by 50% every 1 to 2 days that you use it consecutively. The only sure way to reduce tolerance is lower your dose or take a break. After one dose it takes about 3 days for tolerance to return to nothing. For heavy users it can take 1-2 weeks. After more than a few days of moderate-high doses it's basically impossible to get that amazing first time high feeling at any dose until you take a break from it. 

Adderall isn't physically addicting in the way that benzos and opiates are, however it can be very psychologically addicting. How prone you are to addiction depends on the individual, some people will get instantly hooked and others will never get addicted. Taking recreational doses for 5+ days in a row will usually result in the high not being all that pleasant anymore, after stopping you will feel extremely depressed and tired, probably anxious and irritable, you will crave Adderall just to feel normal because your brain is used to the high level of dopamine. For a one off binge like that things should balance out in a few days to a week and the only withdrawal effects after that will be craving it. I haven't personally gone past that point, but I've heard from people who abused it for long periods of time(months or years) that it can take 1-3 months for their mood and energy to completely return to normal. 

The biggest issue with addiction to it in my opinion is if you're already suffering from depression and use it to cope with that it will eventually make things much worse. If you're severely depressed, get high on Adderall constantly then run out you may feel suicidal. Eventually the drug will stop making you productive and happy and will just keep you feeling somewhat normal. 

Binges are a different story, staying up for multiple days can lead to psychosis, it's also extremely hard on the body, especially if you aren't eating properly. You will look like shit and feel like shit, but stopping use for a while, getting enough sleep, and taking care of yourself will reverse all that relatively quickly. It's nowhere near meth when it comes to the potential for super long binges and psychosis, but it's still possible. Adderall is one of the least harmful recreational stims overall, but should still be respected.

I, for some reason, decided to start inhaling that compressed gas/air stuff that removes dust. I bought some because my computer was running hot but after I cleaned it I still had basically a whole bottle. That shit cost me $12 and i wasn't going to waste it!  


I seen on the back of the bottle it has one of those parent abuse warning things, so it made me think it must have some type of recreational value, right? After thinking about it for all of 10 seconds I took a deep breath of it after spraying it into my cupped hands. Not going to lie; it was pure bliss for about 10 seconds!  


Before I did it again I figured I should do a bit of research. Found out what all of you probably already know, this shit is nothing like whip-its. It turns out it just cuts off oxygen to your brain for a short period of time. But even after figuring that out I can't seem to stop! I don't do it daily but if I am at home and am in a bad place mentally I simply take a couple of deep inhales of the shit (still the same can) and it seems to cheer me up.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*Note: Don't even try it. If you want to experience a drug, do it right. Research it and decide if it's a good choice. In this case I wish I would have done that before finishing a whole can of something that basically suffocates you...**  


Why did I make this post? I don't know. I think mostly because I'm drunk and huffing compressed gas at 8AM on a Sunday after calling off of work the night before. It makes you think about things a bit.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akbte8/i_think_i_have_started_using_one_of_the_most/

32367,Alprazolam,I (20f) suspect I had Xanax seizure.,"Hi, I’m relatively petite (118ib, 5’4) lady- so I always be careful when doing substances because I feel as if it’s a contributing factor in how light-weight I am.

I been on and off Xanax (2mg at night) and Valium (10mg- when I was taking it) both prescribed legally for GAD but used it solely and strictly to sleep at night for 2 years now. Usually, midnight-2am every night for almost 2 months now to where it was **consistent** rather than sporadic. Other than that, I generally don’t engage in any other substances- including smoking pot even. 

Yesterday I did some coke, started at 9pm. Ended at 4am. Took 2MG of Xanax at 6:30AM. Fell asleep at 7am. Woke up at 11am for some noise disturbance in my building, suddenly my whole face couldn’t move (as if it was almost vibrating) and I stared drooling out my mouth. I thought I was about to die. I couldn’t talk. My ears started popping. I never had a seizure my whole life- and I only did a 1.5 gram of coke split with another person. Anywho- the experience was horrifying.

I’ve been off it since my last class last semester on December 21st. While it has been easier to concentrate without them since I got a nice break to be off of them without any classes to worry about it still isn’t easy because I have ADD.

So I got a 5mg prescription for Ritalin and I was wondering if I could snort it right before class and then maybe the effects would be gone not long after class. Am I in the right direction thinking that’d work?

Also, if so, would this have any adverse side effects in short and long term that I wouldn’t have from just taking the pills orally?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akcbiq/can_i_snort_5mg_of_ritalin_before_classes_to_get/
32402,Long Post,Never become a dealer.,"I'm sorry for the long post...

I was an average child in a middle-class family and loving parents. However my life was the most boring thing you could imagine. At 12, I spent all day playing video games, had a few internet friends but that was it. Never felt true happiness.

This all changed when I got into one of the best high schools in the country. Slowly started making friends, became social, even though I hated most of the classes I still loved being there. At 14 my and my friends circle of friends found a shady pub and got drunk almost every day, which suprisely didn't influence our grades. That is when I tried weed,liked it and used it in moderation. Things went fine except some failed relationships. Finally I was one of the top dogs and found balance friends, family and grades. Then someone who was really close to me died. He taught me everything, spent my childhood with him, he was there when nobody else was. Happened in 2014, never got over it, I dont think I'll ever will.

This went on for a while, until the last year when I had a final exam which decides which University you can get accepted into. The exam was a blast, second best result in the school, I  thought I was on top of the world and nothing can stop me.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Then University started, I went to a really shitty one, which I had nothing to do with. The dropout was inevitable.

Found my old friend the first day, and started smoking every day, then tried Xanax, I liked it a lot. I hated the whole University, one day I decided to go and quit. I went to the bus station, listening to lil peep when a guy stopped me. He asked if I had any money n If I had Xanax he would buy it. I declined because it would've been really shady but something cliked in my head even if I was too shy back then.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

A lot of my friends did the same. They started working. With a high school diploma if you are lucky you can get a job which gets you roughly 500 euros/570 USD. Of course it was not enough for me, even though I wasn't addicted to anything at the time. I did not get a job, basically sat at home but going out every night, selling old stuff, living on my parents money and barely scraping by.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

One day I got invited to a pub where I barely knew anybody. They group was younger, rich and learned. I had a good time, made a few new friends and then popped a Xanax. It was not my first time but it changed everything. The whole group looked at me, asking ""Oh my God, you can get it here without a prescription?"". ""If you have the connections like I do, everything is posible"" I said. Gave some to them, we got close and met up almost daily, but didn't get adicted to Xans.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I always had a dream to go to Canada. I had a relative who could guarantee that for me. A few days later his wife called, my relative died in a motorbike accident. I lost all my hope but my friends were there for me. I met up every second day with the girls I met at the bar and two of my best friends, made friends at the bar, It was the best part of my life. I had everything but started running low on money.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

That week I had a phone call from one of the people I was at the bar with. ""Could you hook me up?"" I was really shy, didn't even carry weed in public before and was terrified of the police even though they never even searched me before.

For some reason I agreed, took the bus, sold it, made money for the first time. I cannot describe that feeling. Meeting up somewhere, trading a handful of pills for a good amount of cash... My jackets front pocket was always full of money. Everywhere I went, anything I needed I took out the bundle and paid, be it coke, weed, hash, lean, speed, pizza, a hotel room or literally anything. I got 30 euros of allowance for a month before that, It was weird to be able to buy 2 grams of coke for a weekday. It was fun but started getting out of control.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

My plug at the time was a guy like my  age who sold everything under the sun, was really dumb and got busted.

My business slowly started growing and I needed a plug ASAP. As I got used to the fast money, spent a lot, it was the best time of my life I needed to keep on.

I couldn't find anybody. One of my friends was into the deep web at the time, and found a phone number. I dialed it without hesitation, found a cool plug, we met a  few times, business started blooming again.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Few weeks later I got invited to the guys flat. It was really scary, my heart beat like crazy, the plug is a cool guy but you would not mess with him.

On the way up he asked my about my  life. I did the stupid mistake of lying. The plug asked: ""Why do you need more pills every week? Do you smoke weed? Because I do haha"" He noticed that I was anxious and started to roll a blunt.

I said that I didn't smoke, and that my girlfriend needed it for panic attacks. (I had half an OZ of good skunk in my other outer jacket pocket.)

We got up,the stairs, went in the room, sat down to talk then suddenly I looked down the barrel of a loaded revolver.

The plug said that this is the last time we lied to each other and I should properly introduce myself. Also took my phone and weed away, checked me for wire then gave everything back. The situation ended really good,we smoked and I got the permission to buy the pills in bulk, making even more profit.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Everything stayed fine but I started to ignore my family and my friends looked at me differently then before and feared for me. I became addicted to Xanax, smoked daily, I did everything they offered me. I could because I felt unstoppable. I could never afford to blow a 100 euros a night, now it was usual. I thought that I was living the dream. It was the last warning that I needed  to stop.

I don't wanna make this too long, I looked down some more barrels, got beaten up, stolen from, became estranged from the most important people I knew. My friends.

There is literally no reason for me to keep living. I got a job I hate, ruined the chance of a relationship, ignored my family, addicted to everything I get my hands on.a

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I often tear up when I think about it. I ruined everything, especially that I made a girls mental problems worse than before, (not my gf but someone I care about.) hooked people on benzos, I needed to lie too many times to even count it. The worst of all is that I dont have my best friend to go through hard times anymore. He said everything before it happened but I was too stubborn to listen. Now here I am, 3AM, writing the story of my life for reddit, waiting for blow and I hope it furs up my heart once for all.

Yesterday for example woke up to go to work popped a bar with coffee then when I was leaving worked popped a bar before eating food and did a little shopping. Got home popped 2 and smoked a good bit. Still not passing out some how mind you but got up in my sleep after knocking out finally and popped 2 more. I feel pretty good right now I'm about to get up go to the corner store get me a hot sausage po boy and some coffee and guess what? Pop another one.

32423,Lisdexamphetamine,What're your guys experience with Vyvanse?,"So apparently I got diagnosed with some form of ADHD, and since I'm in Brazil,  they're going to give me Vyvanse.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue is that I don't really think I have **any** form of ADHD, but rather I'm just a spectacular idiot. Irregardless of that, I just wanted to know how I could best optimise the usage of Vyvanse for school. I really need to perform better in school this year because if I don't my dads gonna send me to some boarding school and I'll probably OD from abusing cocaine or some shit.

&amp;#x200B;

The difference between Vyvanse and Adderall or Ritalin is that I heard, and read online, that Vyvanse lasts for 14 hours or so, maybe 10 IIRC. So what I plan on doing is buying Ritalin, which is a short term drug, something like 3 hours, and just pop it while studying maths.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I can't just pop a Vyvanse at 6 PM and study for a couple hours, because from *my* understanding, that shit lasts like 10+ hours, and I'll end up crashing at like, what, 5 AM?

How should I best utilise Vyvanse for school?

32487,Psychedelics,First time tripping - Became a piano,"So I was at a birthday party with some friends. I brought about 10g of weed, 2g of speed and a tab (don't know the dosage) and decided that I'll just drop a tab and let it do it's magic and give my friends weed or speed depending on what they want. While waiting for my trip sitter to arrive I got bored and decided to drink a bit and I put the blotter on my tongue after a few drinks. When my trip sitter arrived I was already starting too feel a bit funny. I started smiling and just feeling like the world is awesome.
I start talking to my trip sitter and we go to the bathroom do some lines (bad idea, I know). When we were done I start looking at the mirror like it's some sort of magic. I look at everything like it's something new and never seen before. My trip sitter got out of the bathroom and started doing shots or whatever while I was alone in the bathroom. Suddenly I start feeling cold and scared for some reason and just run out.

I take a seat and start scratching the table and poking myself with the fork. My trip sitter comes along (already wasted) and tells me to never touch a fork and to hold on a napkin (which I did and even brought it home). About 2hrs into the trip I start feeling really cold I start shivering. Some of my friends come along and give me a cigarette. I start looking at a picture of a horse and the eyes start becoming red and black. Being kinda scared I looked away and got outside to light a cigarette and just feel the wind. So with the party nearly over and every 30 minutes of doing lines in the bathroom with my trip sitter I sit down on a bench to just relax. My trip sitter comes and asks me help him take a piss. Keep in mind that this dude was wasted as fuck (his eyes were going up and down and his tongue was out) and we were hugging like hell and telling each other we love the other one while the party was going.
I help my ""trip sitter"" take a pee and even zip his pants for him. I give him all my weed and tell him to roll it all (trust me he rolls really good regardless of what he's on) and he starts asking me for more speed which I refused because I was scared he was going to die(I almost started crying).

After the party was over we smoke the weed and start going home. One kid who was following us started yelling and the we saw a cop car pull up. I was scared shitless so I threw my last bag of speed. Luckily they didn't do anything so I got home safely. My trip sitter went to another party.

When I got home I just wanted to sleep but couldn't. I turned off the lights and jumped into the bed. When I closed my eyes I started imagining the scary maze lady. I opened my eyes - still there. I fell out of my bed trying to reach the light switch. After finally turning on the light I sat on the computer and started programming while listening to some Janis Joplin. Keep in mind this was at like 3AM. After writing some weird shit into the notepad like:""Speed is bad - speed hurt my friends"", I decided to draw. After drawing Jesus and some other shit I lay down in bed and just start playing myself thinking I was a piano. This lasted about an half an hour until the walls started melting and the cracks on the walls started getting bigger and smaller. The melted wall material became a girl and she started jumping on my dick while I was jacking off. After finishing I got out of my room to peel oranges at 4AM while my parents were wondering what the fuck I was doing. I finally grab my cat, lay down in bed and get some fucking rest - 12-13 hours after dropping the tab.

All in all the trip was awesome - would do again for sure but I'm kind scared of speed. 
Right now I'm looking into purchasing some shrooms just out of curiosity. 

Your thoughts on all of this?

32555,Cannabis,Why does my body react so strongly to weed?,"About the 5th time I smoked weed, I was uninformed about the concept of panic attacks and heart palpitations which lead to me having a strong panic attack under the assumption that it was a heart attack. I seemed to forget about much of what I experienced until I smoked again yesterday. The first time this happened was most certainly because I smoked a large amount of a high thc strand without any tolerance. This time, I smoked strong shit again, but the only difference is that I took two hits. Within 2 minutes, I already felt high out of my mind and I tried to ignore it and enjoy it as my friend said I was just tripping. I then instinctually demanded that I go to sleep, was extremely needy, and felt myself get stuck in what can hardly be described: a time loop, looping through days of my childhood with the worry that I might not survive. I heard random ass made up words being looped over and over again, and it was like there was a huge blob of trippiness in my vision being looped through over and over again as I was sucked in. I remember my friends asking me if I needed to throw up so they got me a trash can, and as I was throwing up it was just like experiencing a fever as a child (which I remember hallucinating from years ago), it literally felt like I was in my old bed at 6 years old staying home from the 1st grade puking at night. Then it felt at one point like my mom was holding me in her arms and I was puking onto that little thing babies wear around their neck. I forget what it's called lol. But there's not a doubt in my mind that it was clean weed, I trust the supplier with my life and he smoked the whole ass rest of the blunt and was fine. His mom buys the shit too and she wouldn't give her kid bad shit. But has anyone heard of schizophrenic like trips that I experienced off of two average hits of weed? I know anxiety has a role in it but could it also be an allergic reaction or a reaction with my medicine? (Vyvanse, buspirone, risperadol) Any information on my (this sounds funny to say, but im gonna say it) ""weed trips"" would be appreciated.

Just that boring, depressed kid with anxiety issues who ate alone at lunch during school. Just getting through life day by day, not really enjoying much of it (thanks mental illness). All my pain was internal, invisible, silent. No one batted an eye even though I was dying inside everyday for years. I have no mouth and I must scream. I think drugs gave me that much needed voice in a way, it's like ""Hey! Look, I'm in pain! Here's proof!"" It's a cry for help, and one that isn't so silent. Now people start noticing and asking if I'm okay, i don't know the answer to that question, I'd never been asked, not really. I wonder if they only pay attention now because of how one's addiction could affect them in some negative way, I don't know, it's hard to explain. I guess I just needed someone to listen.

32591,Stimulants,Thought you folks might have some insight. Tripping without amphetamine if I take amphetamine (for ADHD) daily.,"As I said I take Dexedrine daily for ADHD, therapeutic doses, living healthy (thanks to the Dexedrine, actually). I would not remotely say my use patterns resemble that of the scary tweakers officer friendly warned us about; it truly is a medical thing for me and I've taken the same 40mg daily for ten years or so, the main body of its helpful effects not fading being as I never increase the dose and always sleep (pro tips for you). Nevertheless, because I'm so reliant upon it now, when I don't take it I feel quite depressed, tired, anxious, and hungry to say the least. For this reason I have been concerned whether taking LSD without the normal amphetamine would be a certain bad trip. However, I have already tried mixing them at low doses and for me the result is not good. Nervous mess with lingering feeling of being blasted with electricity, nothing like what LSD used to do for me.

Stopping my medication for more than a couple days only to give another day of functionality to tripping is unfortunately not an option for me either.

I suppose what I'm wondering is whether the LSD renders the standard 'withdrawal' from stimulants unimportant, in your experiences. I do miss psychedelics, it's been a while you know?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ake8ec/thought_you_folks_might_have_some_insight/

32694,Psychedelics,Had sex with my friend's girlfriend on 400ug,"Warning: Very long post. Still processing it and thought writing it out might help.

Yesterday I went over to my friend's house (I'll call him M) to trip. We are somewhat experienced with LSD, having tripped 8 times already. The highest dose we had done before was 300ug, but most trips were on 150-250ug. Our last trip was in November, and in between this time M had gotten a girlfriend, who I'll refer to as S. Since we were doing our highest dose yet, we thought we could use a trip sitter and S volunteered. I have met her a few times and she's really chill, we get along pretty well so it was fine by me. I arrived at his house around 6 PM and we dropped the tabs immediately.

Around 45 min in we already started giggling a bit and this eventually lead to an enormous outburst of laughter. We usually watch The Eric Andre Show on the come up and this time was no different. S was just watching us in amazement and laughed too. After half an hour the laughing died down a bit and I told M that I really started feeling it and he said that he felt the same. It was the moment I realized what I was in for and the vibe became more 'serious' if that makes sense. We had both stripped down to our underwear (we usually do this) because both our body temperatures started going crazy. I was sweating and sometimes shivering at the same time.

From 7 till 8 I gradually started ascending and around 8:30 I was having major visuals and some CEV's. It hit me very hard, and M said that he thought he was heading towards ego death. My thoughts were a mess and I was panicking. S put on some Red Hot Chilli Peppers and this put me a very good mood. After half an hour (could be an hour too) I asked M something and he didn't reply. He looked at me, closed his eyes and laid down on the couch.I was pretty worried about M but decided it would be best to just let him be. He had a smile on a face so that was a good sign. For whatever reason I started panicking again and I couldn't control myself anymore. I was overwhelmed and couldn't handle everything that was happening around me. Felt like I was going batshit insane. This is where S put her hands on my shoulders and calmly told me to relax. Positive energy filled my body and she told me to lay down in M's bedroom and take it easy. I asked if she could put Pink Floyd on my speaker and she brought me a glass of water and some grapes. I was in heaven. I saw some shit double or mirrored, I can't exactly remember, and gave in and closed my eyes on the bed. I felt so good, my CEV's were going crazy.

S went to check on M again and came back to see how I was holding up after god knows how much time. I said I was doing amazing, and she asked if I wanted a massage. I reasoned (as far as I was capable to do so) that it would be rude to say no and told her if it was no inconvenience for her I would love one. She put a towel on the bed and grabbed some massage oil and started. It felt so good I couldn't believe it. I closed my eyes and just let it happen. I have felt nothing like it in my life. I was constantly smiling and euphoria filled my body. She told me to turn around and lie down on my back to finish the massage. I actually wanted her to keep going with whatever she was doing but I complied, as she was the one giving the massage.

Apparently my guy downstairs was having a good time too as when I turned around S started laughing and I didn't know why. When I finally realized what was going on I started laughing too and kept saying sorry. She said it was okay, it happens and to just relax and enjoy the moment. I think the second part of the massage only lasted a few minutes (I had no concept of time though) until she started touching my dick through my boxer. She said something like does he need a massage too or some weird shit like that. I just looked at her in confusion but didn't respond as I truly had no idea what she meant. Well, she took this as a yes and started giving me a handjob. This felt *really* good, so good I felt like I was paralyzed.

I personally have a hard time getting to my climax on L and this time that was the case too. When I opened my eyes for the first time in idk how long I noticed that she was actually blowing me now. I had no words, I must say I didn't fully understand what was going on but it felt good. If the sensation is good everything is fine. After what must have been quite some time I was getting closer to my orgasm and everything started to become even more intense. The colors became extremely vivid and I was practically blinded by OEV's. She stopped for a bit, took off her clothes and sat down on top of me. I was in pure ecstasy. I was unable to move and talk. I closed my eyes and saw colors rushing through my mind and when I came it was like a blissfull explosion of rainbows and euphoria. I have no clue how long I was laying down before I opened my eyes, but I saw S smiling at me and my heart filled with joy.

I put my undies back on and checked my phone for the first time. It was 1 AM already and I got up to visit M. He was back to reality and started telling me about what he had went through. All I did was nod and 'hmm' because I realized what I had done and could not take my mind off it. I felt terrible, I got into a very bad thought loop and eventually snapped out of it when M put on some music. We kinda chilled and S took care of us and gave us some food and juice. I was not able to look her in the eye, I felt disgusting. Around 3:30 I said I wanted to go to sleep and M thought it was a good idea too. We both took a bar and passed out on the couch.

It was 11 AM when S woke me and M up as she had made breakfast. I still felt terrible. Instead of my usual afterglow I was (and still am) experiencing an after-depression. I feel so so bad. I went home ASAP and got a few texts from M about how positive he came out of his experience and that he was sorry for being 'gone' during the peak. I told him it was fine and said that I had a good time too. S texted me too asking how my 'trip' (yes those quotes belong there) was and I haven't replied to her yet.

I'm going to take the rest of the day to contemplate what the fuck I'm going to do now.

Edit: Y'all convinced me. I'm going to his place tonight and tell him what happened. Thanks for all the support.

Edit 2 -

Update: Didn't think this would blow up like it did. I am really trying to read every comment and once again, thanks for all the advice and kind messages. 

Went to his house about 3 hours ago. I was nervous as fuck, but I had to power through. Sat down with him and he started talking about the trip and how much he had enjoyed it. He knew something was up with me as we know each other too well to hide it when there's something bothering us. He asked if I had some issues with the trip and that he would be here to listen if that's the case. That's when he also said that S told him she had given me a massage, and that I enjoyed it so much I wouldn't mind getting a few more (???????). He asked if it was cool if she came over too and this is where I decided to tell him

I almost broke down saying it but I told him I didn't just get a massage from S. He asked what I meant and I told him what had happened. He didn't say a word and looked at me in disbelief. I said that I was sorry, but that I had no control over the situation and I had to tell him as I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I kept quiet. He got up, walked around a bit and sat down again. I was just waiting for his response and didn't dare to say another word. 'She told me she gave you a massage' were his first words. I apologized again and he asked me how it all went down and I told him. Felt like he didn't believe me for a sec because all he did was shake his head. 

To keep things relatively short: We ended up talking for some time, and he said he believed me but had to find out from S himself before 'actually' believing it. He wants to come up with a plan to catch her, we only have no idea how though. I said I would help him out anyway possible, he said that's the least thing I could do after fucking his girlfriend, lmao. 

I feel like there is a HUGE weight off my shoulders and am so glad I told him. Didn't think it would work out how it did. S telling him about the massage is honestly the best thing that could have happened to me. He seemed OK to me when I left, although he is undoubtedly mad at me and S but he didn't let it show. That fucker took it like a champ and I have nothing but respect for him. Don't know what we're going to do now and what our friendship will be like in the future, but at least he knows. Thanks to everyone who told me to do the right thing.

32845,MDMA,UK and it’s wild MDMA culture,"Bit of a rant here on my lovely mdma comedown from dropping 2 pills on Friday night but it’s something for you to read :)

I dropped some mandy for an event on Friday and it had me thinking. I had 2 pingers (dose unknown), a few bumps of K and a bump of Coke then some xans to comedown. Great mix but suffering now. 

I was thinking about how wild people in the UK are with mandy. They say 0.1/0.2 is enough for a good experience which is sort of true, however if you were to suggest splitting 1gram of good mdma with 5-10 friends it would be almost laughable. Most people like to drop between 0.5-1gram of mandy on a night (admittedly myself included). Walking around eyes rolling back and jaw swinging isn’t really seen as embarrassing at a rave. Also spacing between mdma experiences is not really considered here as some people will get pinged easily more than once per month. Every time I get wired I think “fuck this is so good why don’t I do it every weekend” even though I’m still very aware that by 5am I’ll know why I couldn’t do it every weekend.

Same with the ket, even people who “don’t really do drugs” will indulge in ket now and then.

32856,Psychedelics,"Candyflipped at a techno party, CRAZY telepathic moments with my friend, and EVERY FUCKING GIRL tried to hit on me","This post is going to be pretty long so I've divided it in sections from which you can choose what to read. English is not my native language so excuse any errors. Enjoy!

I'm from Belgium and last thursday I finished my mid-terms (fucking finally), and the day after Ross from Friends, a lo-fi house dj, was going to play in the best techno venue here. Me and 2 friends already bought tickets months in advance and were hyped as fuck for this event. I'm gonna call them Ross and T-bone.

I'm very comfortable with tripping and have always felt like I'm in control. I have candyflipped once at a party half a year ago but took too little MDMA to feel the full effect, being on the cautious side. So I convinced Ross to try candyflipping for his first time and my second time, but T-bone still wasn't sure.

# Dropping the acid and the guy with the  bloody face in the tram

The day of the party comes and we're chilling at T-bone's dorm, wasting time, playing uno, eventually we conviced T-bone to take half a hit of LSD to be in the same headspace as us. 9.30 PM hits and we're dropping the acid. By 10.30 we're starting to feel the effects and head to the tram to go to the venue. While we're chilling and laughing in a pretty empty tram.

Out of nowhere; a guy in his late 40's comes towards us and is sitting next to us asking what's up. His eye is swollen as fuck, blood running down his face. He was obviously drunk. He starts telling us in broken Dutch how he got in a fight with 3 guys the day earlier, how they fucked him up and took all his shit. Then he told us how he went to the hospital, they stitched his eye, and told him to leave as they don't see the importance in keeping him there for the night. He's telling us how he begged them to stay, cause he doens't have any money or a phone to call his girl, but they refuse. At this point the acid starts to REALLY take effect and we're all just staring in disbelief at him not knowing what to say or how to act. At this point he starts beggin us for money telling us he only has 5 euros and needs to get to some other city. I told him 5 euros is more than enough to take the bus and get there, but he's still begging for more. All 3 of us are broke college kids and need to money to get fucked up that night obviously. We insisted he gets off at the train station where he can take a bus. But we pass it and we're all like fuck we need to wait till next stop till we can get rid of him. All the while he's still begging and telling shit like he's a kickboxer and also fucked the other 3 guys up (which I doubt), so we eventually get him off at the next stop, and start laughing hard as fuck as to why this has to happen while we're tripping balls haha. All good though we're almost at the venue.

We're at the place and I'm having some awesome visuals. I insisted that I'll take the tube with joints in my pants while we're getting in. Security picks my out and start to search me. I'm freaking out a bit in my head trying to keep my cool. I had some pills and mdma in my wallet which they searched nonchalantly (thank god) and didn't find, they let me through and told me to have a good night. We're inside and get to the stage, feeling the awesome vibrations of techno music and preparing for what is going to be a legendary night.

# CANDYFLIPPINGG

Midnight hits and we decide to take half a pill each, so it'll kick in when Ross from Friends starts playing at 1 AM. We take the pills, dance some more, vibe with some people and having a good time in general. Ross from friends start playing and at this moment the 3 of us started candyflipping HARD. It was by far the craziest feeling I have ever experienced. We're dancing our fucking asses of while enjoying some awesome visuals I never had. Everyone had a kind of red and green glow around them, like the 3D filter effect. The night progresses while we take some more MDMA and the visuals get even crazier. At this point I'm at the peak of my trip and everyone's face was like glitching or something, best example I can find was something like  \[this\]([https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3786/13080916984\_28459f565c\_b.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3786/13080916984_28459f565c_b.jpg)). Me and my friends are rolling hard and several people are enjoying our energy, some asking what we took as we all screamed ""CANDYFLIPPINGGG"". There were also a lot of people asking me for pills, like more than usual. We went to get drinks while another guy approached me in a friendly way and asked me if I had some more pills. Told him we only have 1 left for us. Then I asked him if I look like a drug dealer cause he was literally the 30th something person who asked me. He replied: ""DUH, look at yourself, your pupils are the size of fucking oranges."" I started laughing and talking some more with this guy after I returned to my friends. T-bone was on the phone with his girl as me and Ross we're observing our visuals at the drinks stand. You know when you have tracers when you take acid, if you move your hand it'll like have some kind of path behind it. We both saw this with people as they were moving but really exaggerated. A dude was walking past us and it was like there were 5 more versions of the same guy following him.

# Telepathic connection with Ross

So me and Ross are in the middle of the crowd, T-bone went to find another friend, and we're just enjoying one of the best sets I have ever heard. I'm talking to Ross about fuck knows what for a couple of minutes when suddenly, I turn my head to face him and look at him in disbelief while he's just looking forward, smiling and dancing. He sees me looking at him, turns to me and has the same  face of disbelief looking at me. ""DUDE, we just were fucking talking weren't we?"" I said. ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT DUDE"" he screamed. ""What was the last thing I said?"" I asked. He nailed every fucking word I said and told me what we were talking about. I told him ""DUDE it's like I know every fucking thing you're gonna say right now and you know everything I'm about to say"". He felt the same way. We were absolutely BLOWN AWAY by this. The next 30 minutes consisted of both of us talking about it in disbelief, sometimes even catching ourselves to talking to each other in our heads again. This was by far the craziest thing I have ever experienced  in my life, and I feel like I have connected with him on a whole other level.

# Why did every fucking chick want me while I'm tripping balls

It's about 3-4AM and the pills starting to wear off, we took some more mdma but I didn't feel like it had the same effect like at the start, so I was less energized and social, but still enjoying the music. I'm not an ugly guy, I lift, eat and look healthy. I get some attention from chicks but not even 1% as this night. I came into the party not wanting to pick up chicks, I wanted to trip, roll, and chill with my friends. I don't know when the attention from all the women started but this is what I have gathered from 2AM to 6AM.

I have had at least 70 different girls dancing way too close right in front of me. Even though I rarely switched places, they seemed to come and go every 5-10 minutes. Not only in front of me, to my side, behind me, I was literally surrounded by girls. I have seen every kind of girl dance too close in front of me, obviously trying to catch my attetention. And I mean literally every kind of girl, yound, old, black, white, asian, mixed, tall, short, fat, skinny, ugly, fucking 9-10 hotties, gay dudes, trans chicks. It started slow and just random girls but as I rejected all of them, just by not doing anything really, the girls got hotter, wilder and more extreme. There were at least 5 times were someone spilled a drink over my leg, and at least 5 other times were someone bumped into me spilling their drink on my shirt. Girls were passing by, slowing down in front of me, and then continuing. They were almost always alone (what girl [walks](https://walks.is)/is alone at a party), and this happened frequently, with same chicks. It even got as far as if someone was dancingand presenting their ass in front of me, I'd admire it, slightly moving forward, while suddenly out of nowhere these random chicks pass violently right between me and the ass presenting chick, this happened on several occasions.

Until around 4.30AM I didn't talk to any girl trying to catch my attention. I'm just dancing around, and I see this chick dancing next to me, and I remember her from another party. This girls isn't the hottest, like a 6.5, and pretty reserved. Not someone the ""hottest"" guy in the place would go for (I feel like such an asshole typing this). So I say ""Hey! I know you!"". And I shit you not guys. There were like 7 different chicks behind her who were on their phone, they SUDDENLY all got their head up and faced me and the chick, with disbelief in their eyes. This threw me off guard sooo hard. The girl I was talking to was also in disbelief and asked me from where I know her. I just replied ""idk"" and started dancing again, asking myself if that really just happened.

From 4.30 to 6.30 more bitches dancing around me, more bitches pouring their drink over my shit. I don't have any problem with eye contact so whoever faced me and tried to take my attention I just stared at for however long they'd stare at me. Constantly I was questioning WTF was happening, I just couldn't believe I had literally every girl's attention, they were almost fighting over my attention.

By far the craziest thing I realized, is that from all the chicks who I thought were into me, NOT A SINGLE ONE had the fucking guts to say a SINGLE word to me. I regularly saw chicks around me noticing me, then starting to talk to some guys next to me or in front of me, constantly glancing at me. I eventually made it a game that whoever says anything to me, other than sorry for spilling a drink on me, I'd fully invest in. This didn't happen ever. Until 6.45 and I decided to test if I was imagining everything or it's real.

The party was coming to it's end but I still had a horde of chicks around me. I left my friends, started walking around, eyeballing every chick hard, looking for the prettiest one. I found a gorgeous girl, walked up to her.

Me: ""What's your name?""

Her: ""Cathy!""

Me: ""Congratulations, I choose you."" While staring deep in her soul

Her facial expression was a mixture between happiness, sadness but totally understanding what I meant

Her: ""I appreciate it but it's way too late, the party is ending and you've had your shot with me""

Fuck I didn't even remember her lmao, but my hypothesis was approved and I walked away happy, smiling at every chick.

I headed off to hang with my friend's place as my flatmates don't really appreciate my drug use so I keep it away from them. I knew full-well that not only I'd be on 250ug acid; but I'd probably hit up the speed, heroin and ketamine too. Maybe I'm just irresponsible.


There was a party the next day so I figured I'd do the acid at a less crowded time but more and more people showed up until the point it began to become unbearable for me to be around certain individuals, specifically one that intended to force me into a bad trip and was scrounging for my ketamine for a lot of the night. He's bald and wanted my drugs and became ""evil egg"" to me. Jokingly while I was having a peak; he decided to bring a knife to wave at me to 'give him a key' which drove me to decide the best option was to disarm him and put the knife to my own throat, telling him that I'd rather kill myself than do so. There's only a little nick but it's a reminder of the first time I've freaked on psychs and I spent a lot of the time isolated, waiting to be at a state where I could function enough to be around people as I was waiting on a guy to pick up from me.

33007,I :love: Drugs,Why nicotine is more of an epidemic than ever,"Nicotine addiction is really an epidemic right now and is covered up by opioids but I feel this needs attention.In no way close to the opioid epidemic right now but this is also something to think about.

Nicotine has become more potent and accessible in recent years(I'm sure I didnt need to tell you that.) I remember when I was a kid you could dip or smoke.those were your 2 options.nowadays you have your vapes,hookah,cigarettes and dip.plus they're more accessible than ever and way easier than ever and kids dont know what they're getting into 

I remember the first time I got that sweet nic buzz.i was hanging out at my grandmas with my cousin,as bored teenagers do(13 at the time) we went in search of trouble.we went up to my uncles house that was like a 3 minute walk away to ask what he did at my grandmas(where we where at and where he grew up) he said he'd go with his friends and smoke cigarettes behind the house jokingly.That gave us the idea to steal one of his and try it.We did and smoked it.my cousin joked and said that it was better than jerking off,he wasnt wrong.if you smoke you can probably remember your first buzz.the buzz where you can barely walk and it's just 30 seconds of pure bliss.But sometimes the best things can be the beginning of the worst.

Fast forward to now,been smoking for 10 years now.Ive tried to stop and even got myself a juul to see if it stood up to the hype.its nice but it's not the same.The act of smoking is one of my favorite things but it was time to put down the marlboros in exchange for mint and mangoes.

I understand why these kids get into this shit.tastes like candy and gives you an even stronger buzz than smokes.but once the buzz stops it's no longer than fun,and like any addict you'll do anything for your next fix.Its not only a money hole at this point but it's only bad for you.makes your breath stink,your clothes stink and turns your lungs black.

I'd rather my kids smoke weed than vape.Not only does it give you an actual high,its not one of the most addictive substances.

Vaping has a new turn on kids getting addicted.not only is it hard to tell if your kids vape but it's also extremely easy to get.I remember covering myself up with cologne or bolting to my room after smoking.now kids can just lock their door and get their fix,or at school.i remember counting the minutes to get home and smoke,or sneak off campus and smoke.its just so convenient in recent years

I understand the opioid epidemic but ""JUULING"" is just so pointless.you dont even get high,of course I'd rather a kid vape than smoke crack or iv heroin but it's just a pointless crutch.My kids will always know that if they feel the need to do anything they can come to me and I'll smoke them out,no doubt.better than them doing It behind my back the way I used to do it.dont let your kids smoke out of water bottles lol

But I want to know what you guys think,I just have today off and nothing to do.Have a good day fellow r/drug ies ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akhr9q/why_nicotine_is_more_of_an_epidemic_than_ever/
33016,Quetiapine,Suicidal thoughts because of Seroquel,"Hello, i am posting this for a friend. Can someone help us determine what this might be due to? Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm prescribed seroquel 150 (increased over four weeks from 50) for mood  stabilization for my Bipolar I but i've developed unbearable anxiety.  can obsessive/intrusive thoughts (which then cause suicidal thoughts)  and constant anxiety that don't stop from the minute you wake up be a  side effect of increasing Seroquel to 150mg per night? Dose is taken at 7  PM, fall asleep at 9 PM wake up around 7 AM, high anxiety, obsessive  thoughts of comparing to other people, negative thoughts all day long.  ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akhta0/suicidal_thoughts_because_of_seroquel/
33057,Psychedelics,The Cuil Theory Trip,"So a while ago I stumbled across an audio clip on tumblr that melted my brain. Every few days I would go back and listen to it because it was so strange and chaotic yet serene.
The kind of mindset listening to it put me in was what I imagined it was like to trip with psychedelics. Then I tried LSD a couple of days later. I didn't get to listen to it while I was tripping but I made it a goal to see what it's like listening to while tripping.

Then an opportunity came up where I was sober and a couple of friends had dropped acid. I'm not sure exactly where in the trip I played it, but I was alone in the lounge with one and I asked her if I could play this audio clip for her because it fascinated me. She said go ahead, so I played it. 
After it had finished, I genuinely thought I'd broken her. She was just staring at me with a concerned, worried, shocked face, and I asked if she was okay. She was perfectly fine and said she wasn't tripping at the beginning of it but by the end she was having an extremely intense trip. And at that moment I knew I had to spread this experience as far and wide as I can because I think it's something everyone should experience, if they wish.

But anyway, I guess now is the time to reveal this clip. It's called the 'Cuil Theory', and it is the best thing I have heard.
https://youtu.be/nfdEdE96En0 this is the link to the video the audio originally came from. I highly recommend just listening to the audio and not watch the video because it's just the text of the audio. 
For best experience sit or lie down somewhere comfortable, and either close your eyes or just look at something and listen to it. Don't pause it and take a break, it has to been in one sitting.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, hope you guys enjoy it if you decide to do it.

TL;DR
I played a really trippy audio clip called the Cuil Theory while my friend was on LSD causing an intense trip. Listen to it while tripping if you want: https://youtu.be/nfdEdE96En0",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aki4eq/the_cuil_theory_trip/

33143,Cannabinoids,Passed out from weed and propananol?,"So basically I went to a house party a few days ago and I was feeling quite nervous so I took 1 10mg pill of propananol to help me with my anxiety.

I ate quite a lot of food as well because you aren’t supposed to have it on an empty stomach so about 1/2 hours later  I did something stupid and forgot I took the pill so I had the tiniest bit of alcohol ever (it was jack and Coke) and I had like 5 sips ( it wasn’t strong) anyway I didn’t have a lot because I wanted to smoke weed... 
anyway, I went outside and smoked more than I usually do in a period of time and I felt fine, I was a bit worried I had more than I could handle but it was chill, reality got all weird and time was gone  but  I was enjoying myself.
I then lean my head back because at this point I was remembering my friend puking when we smoked ( I never  puke because I know my limit etc) but because she puked and I saw it  I felt like I needed to vomit too but I nevertheless kept calm ( I wasn’t panicking) I just was a bit distressed  because I felt like I was gonna puke even though I knew I  wasn’t, anyway a few minutes later I calmed down and leaned my head on the wall. Now that I think back o breathed in and out and I felt so calm, it was like I kind of stopped my blood flowing to my brain...

Next thing I know I’ve passed out and smashed my head into a glass table then onto the concrete floor, everyone is surrounding me ( at this point I thought I was having a dream because I closed my eyes  and leaned back and the moment when I did that, reality and me falling unconscious was such a smooth transition I couldn’t tell the difference, I thought I was day dreaming and in the back of my mind I was saying I hope this isn’t real, why can’t I wake up ) anyway everyone is asking if I’m okay and what I took and I say my blood pressure dropped because I have Postual tachycardia syndrome so I can pass out easily but I don’t know if it was that or because of the weed, alcohol and propananol mix ?
 At this point I’m just really confused because I never pass out!

Btw: I am okay, literally right after I woke up I was completely fine, just stoned out of my mind but then like an hour/ 2 hours later I was good after lying down but I want to know if any of you have had similar experiences with propananol or weed and passing out?
 I’m never ever mixing weed and propananol ( baring in mind I think I’ve done it before) but yeah I think imma quit for the time being.


Also I know it’s dumb mixing alcohol and medication but I was only planning on smoking weed and I remember after I had like 4 sips that I took it so I immediately stopped and considering 10mg is such a low dose I didn’t assume it’d do anything.

TDLR:  at a party I basically took  10 mg of propananol, forgot I took it then drank the tiniest amount of alcohol and smoked a shit ton of weed and then I passed out.
I want to know if anyone has had similar experiences with weed and propananol ( I don’t really count the alcohol as it was so little ) ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akiory/passed_out_from_weed_and_propananol/

33380,Cannabinoids,Do you like/dislike dab pens?,"whats up r/drugs broskis, I lurk here every now and then but wanted to share something.

I don't smoke all that often, but I do own a juul.  I started a job recently and my friend told me he got carts for his pen and offered it to me.  I couldn't drive to work since my car got snowed in, so I walked to my homies house.  I come in take a couple hits (I wasn't exactly trying to be ballin on my 4th day bagging groceries).

I'm walkin down the street hyped up and shit waiting or it to hit, but 10-15 minutes go by with nothing.  I clock in thinking his shit was a sham, but as soon as I come down the stairs from the break room, the shit hit me all at once.  So here I am, high off my ass, trying to look normal and bag peoples groceries and shit, but i start to notice that I feel like I'm .  If I wasn't moving or doing anything, I would get the sensation of getting really tiny, and then getting tunnel vision till everything was black and I couldn't hear anything. 

Old people made me so happy, cause they would ask me to take their stuff to their cars, and I had some old man talk about his life in the physics field which tripped me out really hard because I started zoning out as he was talking to me about using a particle accelerator or something, and then I catch my mom waving to me as she left the store, (she has no idea I did any of this and said that I looked so happy bagging because I was smiling ear to ear lmao),

I ended up actually passing through for about an hour or two before i started to comedown, but I remembered reading somewhere on here that nicotine boosts your high, so I went in the bathroom and cleared the ripstick about 3 times before I realized how badly I fucked up.  The Nic buzz and the revitalized high actually put me on my ass and i thought I was in space or floating it hit me so hard. 

All in all I'm highly considering buying a pen now but I also dont know if it would be better to have that or just get a dealer for some good hash. Any recommendations?",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akjysw/do_you_likedislike_dab_pens/
33396,Cannabinoids,Paranoid again,"I smoked for the first time in a few months out of my dorm room window while the fan was running, and unfortunately, my tolerance is really low now. I'm prone to anxiety and the first few times smoking after a long period is a little rough with the paranoia. 

Problem is, I'll always have anxiety attacks about potentially getting in trouble when I'm high. As of now, I'm panicking that I will get in trouble since my room kinda smells like weed, and can even be smelt midway down the hall of my floor. My roommates and I used some Febreze in both our rooms and a bit of the hallway, but I'm scared that someone is going to snitch. We also opened 3 big windows in our suite to air out the smell from the fan, as well as leave a towel under our floor.

33475,Long Post,story about how DMT found me in college....,"ok, so i want to describe an experience i had. very profound 15 mins which i can only describe in this language as aztec themes/symbols (kinda Egyptian like glyphs)  and colors of purples and teals and golds, then i see this aztec like Diety decorated in jewelry with black skin hovering right above my face looking directly into my eyes/brain/3rd eye. i wanna say it was a she, and it wasn’t angry or nice idk how to explain it like she was just looking at me knowing i could see her. like she could see my soul and was intrigued by it. it was so profound i still remember this event from 9 years ago. 

i have never seen blinding bright white light like my friend, and he did the same substance  from the same bag as i did for my “aztec” trip. i never saw this and was kinda jealous b/c i’ve heard a lot of people describing this experience and the more i smoked i still couldn’t see it. i got iron lungs and before i even put the pipe down that alien noise was in my ears and my world became energy that was moving into sacred geometry patterns. 

another crazy experience i still remember from 9 years ago. i laid back, got the geometrical shit, then i remember i felt like i was at the top of a roller coaster ride about to drop down. and i remember thinking to myself no no no i’m dying shit but then i realized i’ve been here before i remember this feeling of this “dying” and the sound in my ears was so distinctive then i went down below the earth not up and it was all red and fire like (i was scared shitless and didn’t like it but still was intrigued by it). that’s all i can remember from that one but i remember returning to my bed in south philly right on south street and being so happy to be alive and be in this world and everything looked vibrant and very sharp  contrast like an acid trip. my mental state was so good i was so happy after that. i rode that happy wave for awhile too. ( i was in college at this time so looking back i was happy and i didn’t know why but now i know..bc i was basically in my prime lol)

i never abused this powerful stuff and really respected it after the first blast. it’s something to be taken very serious. set and setting is always to be taken into account. always be with a good friend you can take emotional risks with and be comfortable with. be somewhere comfy and squishy so when you return it’s not cold and depressing. 

all this is from my own personal experience over my existence. and it’s crazy to think about DMT now that i’ve been away from that for almost a decade.  but i learned about dmt my freshman year in college (07) from my roommate and joe rogan (funny i saw him do stand up in 09 and joey diaz had my sides hurting at the comedy club).  I bought and read rick strassmans book, and then FINALLY by some weird cosmic force a bag of orangish/whiteish crystals magically came into my life!!!! mind you this was after extensive research, and hours of youtube videos of mckenna etc..  it was like i couldn’t get the drug until i fully understood what it was, and its effects and if i was ready mind body and soul to wake up and see this world for what it really is. so crazy how those crystals came into my life after two or three semesters of talking about it during a blunt cypher, hitting the bong or filling a vape up ( we called it casper the friendly ghost lmao) 

i’ve had one more (actually like 2 more now that i think about it lol ) distinct trip that i can still remember like yesterday even tho it was almost a decade ago.

so 4 big giant inhales and by the last one i went straight  into this weird place i can’t describe  where i could see shadow figures moving around in my  peripheral vision, and then my attention turned straight ahead and it was my consciousness sitting in this dark room full of doors and in the middle of the room was some black shadow who i thought was me sitting in the chair and i could kinda do a 360 around it and i could feel the presence of other souls telling me to come stay here it’s a fun place to be. some of the souls felt like some dead family members and friends but one distinct one was mac miller saying it was a party on that side. but by this time my “dream” started faded and could start feeling my organs and my actual physical body and even tho i wanted to stay there my ego wouldn’t let me and it did this by tricking me into remembering the laws of physics this plane of reality operates on. coming back to earth/reality i was weirded out by what i was told (didn’t actually hear them speak) because at that present time i interpreted it as if i die and leave this reality i’ll be loved and be around energy that loves me and i won’t have any shame/guilt/resentment/fear/dishonesty etc etc....also i could feel my favorite rapper telepathically being there with me which was cool but made me think dmt was basically looking into my brain and making sense of my interests and desires. this one really fucked me up about what this dmt shit really is.. i think i didn’t smoke it after that for many moons..

You gotta respect this stuff. i never came back from a trip wanting to do it again right after. you gotta process all the stimuli you just encountered and filter it ( at least for me and i have an addicting personality) 

rip malcolm mccormick miller your songs and lyrics mirrored my journey through 
my late teens and twenties by smoking hella weed with my good friends in college, nasty basement frat party’s, no strings sex, drug experimentation, highs and lows, depression, copious amounts of opiates and cocaine, love found and love lost, arrested, heavy addiction, crashing my car, rehab and then overdosing.. all of it coincided with his current LP ( kids, macadelic, wmwtso, faces, goodam, and swimming) crazy you died the same time i was clinically dead on life support and i died from the same shit too. all of his lyrics i felt like it came from my life. ( very selfish of me but during my college time and drug/festival times i felt like he was speaking to me and i wasn’t the only one who felt like this which got me thru a lot of good and hard times) 

i have some crazy experiences i can’t explain but i feel like the religion of hare krishna really grasps what this world is but i mean it basically teaches what a lot of wise people know without it turning into an organized religion with dogmas they make you believe along with truths. you can give other names to it and but the message stays the same is what i’m saying.

29 years in this life and my world is always showing me signs to keep going even though i keep falling into temptation and it drives me insane. the insanity i have in my brain and i can’t shake it. ( no i’m not insane but i feel like i know if i use certain substances my life becomes unmanageable yet i still do it despite all the signs saying please stop you can be strong)

i’ve been thru a lot this year with overcoming poly substance abuse, finding a higher power and trying to do the right thing in life. i’ve overdosed twice in 6 months first time in my car was miraculously found by 2 old women 5 am in the morning and they called 911 and saved my life. mild overdose was blue and cold when they found me saying i was so lucky if they didn’t get to me much longer no chance. suffered a heart attack with that too. After icu and then downgrading i got 302d n 72 hr in the psych ward. no big deal. i got out and within 5 minuets of getting to my car parked 10 mins from the hospital i find the dope that i killed myself with. mind you the cops went thru my car and my dad “cleaned the entire car out” well he didn’t look under my favorite hiding spot lol my foot rug. did that and got more and then same day realized after i was blitz that this is crazy i need to get outta town and go away for awhile so i did just that and did a 90 day php rehab( made some lifetime friendships and brotherhood bonds during treatment i can’t express) 

then got out and was in the next step down a sober living for only 4 days and drove 4 hours to my dopeboys and really died this time. i was coma for 5 days on life support feeding tube the works. all my organs were shut down, i was septic and so swollen they were so close to amputated my arm off if filleting it didn’t work. my blood pressure medicine had be drilled into my leg bone marrow. all my medical papers for my care signed over to the hospital to make the critical decisions regarding what to do medically. dialysis was in the works and my sister was going to give me her kidney (was told my urine looked like coke and my blood had toxins in it) . and then magically i came to on the 5th day and my swelling went down a little and my organs started repairing themselves...

finally i think everyones morale was lifted from this, but they still thought i’d be a vegetable. after all the hard core sedating and pain killer drugs wore off i still had tubes in every hole of my body except my ears. i couldn’t speak because of the tubes in my throat. it took me 10 hours to barely form a sentence with my family pointing to the words and me nodding to try and make a sentence and me nodding off and the machines beeping like crazy. then i was able to scribble with my hand but no words made any sense.. still was progress and my family was right there with me fighting this battle with me and giving me strength.

all in all i fought through it and bounced back with no brain damage (i dont think at least 😂) but suffered some heart and pulmonary issues. diagnosed with ARDS too..that night the guys i formed a solid bond with in my 90 day rehab drove 4 hours one way to see me in the hospital for a couple hours and then drive back 4 hours before curfew. some of my own family members who live 30 mins from the hospital didn’t even come see me. crazy to think through my recovery i made some of the most meaningful friendships and memories i’ll cherish forever..after i died i did another 30 days in php and got on 12mg subs for a month and cut that out cold turkey no taper and it wasn’t shit compared to what i just went thru a month before. got off subs for 7 days and got the vivitrol shot no trial two day naltrexone pills ( i’m a badass i know haha jk ) 

all my friends in AA were really proud i got off subs that fast too
 
( my insurance must hate me, 100k hospital bills 70k for 28 day detox/rehab, and 15k month for 4 months php lol) 

looking back on this past year of my crazy addiction and recovery its so sad to see what i put my family through, and all that pain and suffering and stress i caused them for being selfish. i lost a lot of friends to addiction this year. just lost my best friend (one of the guys who drove down to see me ) to it and he didn’t get lucky to end up in a hospital. his death really hit home for me. now i make sure to keep in touch with the people i care about almost on a daily basis.

i know this started out dmt related, but i feel like dmt was the starting point of my journey. looking back with hindsight i have to learn everything through trial and error. i’m so stubborn and always have learn the hard way. which is one of my main character defects i’m working on currently.

this world is what you want it to be. plain and simple. be kind and treat others how you would want to be treated and most of all find love and share love with family friends and significant others. i hope one day we can overcome greed on this planet and rise up and see everything for what it really is. we are all just humans with egos that separate us and tell us we are different. we as a planet need to rise above and really take a deep look inside ourselves and have a spiritual awakening.

ps. i never post on reddit but i love reading and getting into the mentality of people with similar interests i had/have at one point in my life.

life’s a journey man. live every day like it’s your last ( easy to say i know) 

please don’t get mad for all this text i never pour my heart and soul out and this took me a couple hours to type up. i hope my experience strength and hope can help someone out there! 

if you can vibe with what i’m saying don’t be shy to DM me. i don’t have a lot of friends who share this same mentality as me and it would be good to find more like minded people. maybe this is what is needed to start a chain reaction that eventually leads to world peace and love for all of mankind.  at least i can dream and no one can take that away from me. too much censorship of free speech is going on in this world. the younger generation needs to come together and kick all the congress and government officials out with that old divide and conquer mentality. we have the numbers to do it. let’s unite of a single altruistic cause and make history.

The trapped acid high is very strong when smoking weed and I dont know how to get rid of it or how long I should wait to smoke weed again.

Acid has pretty much made me feel like I shouldn't smoke anymore and that being high is scary and to be under a high (THC) feels like being trapped in an acid high with no visuals.

33547,Cannabis,Nbome effects on my body bad reaction and weed and nbome death theory,"Okay so i normally buy 1 hit of nbome from a friend i always take it but the other day i took 2 hits and it just was super strong and i had tons of anxiety but thats normal with nbome(it gives you a lot of pure anxiety) the problem was when the trip came down, i was in my room trying to sleep cuz nbome effects include insomnia  so i went to take some weed to sleep, after 15 minutes of smoking the weed i started having super high heart rate i felt my chest going in and out i felt my brain burning felt my blood boiling inside my head then out or nowhere i started seing like a lot of visuals but i felt like the visuals we're my brain cells cooking and exploding i knew i was having a bad reaction i knew i was paniking (its imposible not to panic if you take a substance that can be deadly and start feeling tachychardia and your head boiling) but my friend always takes 2 hits or even higher dosages so i knew i wasnt in OD but still something was wrong this wasnt normal then i read in the nbome subreddit somthing about joint+nbome=death so that freaked me a lot xD but i continued trying to remain calm and doing the best i could to breathing in and out like in yoga, after 1 hour this stopped  . 

So i have 2 hypotesis: maybe was the weed cuz the effects i suffered lasted exactly the time of the weed high. other one is that i maybee had a panic attack but idont think so cuz this all came when the trip of nbome was over (ofcourse i had the panic attack when i felt my brain cooking and my heart exploding but i calmed down) anyways do you think this is realated to the Joint+nbome=death thread And actually weed and nbome is a deathwish or did the weed just pushed me into panic and bad trip. Also i'm not taking nbome again ive learned my leason i'm not stupid now i'm going to take LSD instead but still im courious of what you think 

alsoo ive read the thread of a guy who after 2 hits of nbome experienced the same tachychardia and brain cooking and tingling effects but this guy says he continued using it and the tachychardia and brain cooking continued even when he was completly sober and he developed what i see like chronic panic attack and tachychardia, until his medics gave him clonazepam and other medicines but he continued with the chronic effects.

Update: since then each time i smoked a lot of weed like a dab or bowls in a bong my heart rate goes to the sky and i start yo hace paranoia it's bcuz of the nbome ithink it fucked something un my heart don't try it pls",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akl89c/nbome_effects_on_my_body_bad_reaction_and_weed/
33557,Alprazolam,"Weird thing that happened when I mixed Xanax and Weed, has this happened to anyone else?","This happened a few weeks ago, but I just remembered it and realized how weird of an experience that was. I cant find anything on the internet about it, so ig i’ll ask if anyone here has also experienced it and can tell me what happened.

So, I popped a bar with this girl (I dont do xanax much so I dont have a tolerance and one bar is enough to get me pretty... xanned?) After that, we smoked 2 bowls of this weed that she brought. 

Also, I smoked the same weed the day before, and have to say it was a really weird strain. I was super paranoid and jittery off of it, and didnt really have a good time. 

Anyways, so after we smoked, I was gonna drive to this sushi place that was like 2 parking lots away from where we smoked. As I was driving, both the weed and the xans started hitting me like perfectly synchronized, and for some reason, I got the feeling as if something was wrong. But nothing was wrong, so I was super confused. So I remember saying “Wait... im kinda tripping right now.” Because I was just super confused about what I was feeling, so I pulled over for a sec to try and recollect myself. 

All I did was sit there and try to figure out why I thought something was wrong, or if something was wrong. My friend asked me if I was okay and I told her “I dont know, I think so...” But I still sat there trying to figure out like wtf my brain was doing lol. It was like I was freaking out from the weed, but the xanax made me feel super chill, which just resulted in me being confused. But idk it was like I was super confused and I wasnt at the same time. I tried explaining to her what I was feeling but totally couldnt. It was like my brain just locked up on itself. 

After like 10 minutes of sitting there I realized I probably looked stupid as fuck and I was just like fuck it and kept driving to the sushi place. A few days later I brought it up to my friend and she said that my eyes were really wide open like I was freaking out, which I didnt even realize. 

Anyways, has anyone else experienced this? It wasnt a really horrible experience, once we got to the sushi place I basically got over it. It was just really really weird, and I never felt like that before. ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akla3p/weird_thing_that_happened_when_i_mixed_xanax_and/
33562,Stimulants,Methylphenidate + alprazolam safety,"Hey all,

I plan on taking Ritalin and Xanax together for the first time. I've done the two seperately before, but Google hasn't yielded me any results with the doses I'd like to try.

I have a 2mg pharma Xanax bar and some Ritalin 54mg ERs and 18mg IRs. I'm not sure if I'll insufflate the Ritalin or not yet.

Would you guys recommend I take the 54mg Ritalin ER orally and the 2mg Xanax together, or should I swallow/insufflate 54mg of the Ritalin IR with the Xanax? Which would yield the best results? For refrerence, I currently have no tolerance to either substance. Any dose/safety recommendations are appreciated.

Thanks!

TL;DR: 54mg Ritalin ER orally + 2mg Xanax or 54mg Ritalin IR orally/insufflated + 2mg Xanax?

33585,Psychedelics,"Anyone else get bothered by the whole ""HPPD"" trend? Like its a real disorder and shit but it seems common among psychedelic users to self diagnose themselves with it.","TLDR at bottom.

No. you don't have HPPD if you drop 5 tabs of acid every week and don't feel baseline. No you don't have HPPD because every time you smoke bud after a trip you get anxiety now or your high ""isn't the same"". HPPD is mainly visual disturbances causing distress. Including sometimes flashbacks or episodes.

Just because you triggered some bad anxiety after a trip and it sticks with you doesn't mean you have HPPD. And majority of the time HPPD is distressing. If it ""doesn't bother you"" you most likely have had it for a while or never had it. 

I'm not saying everyone who claims to have it doesn't actually have it. I'm just saying it's not trendy. Hallucinogens can trigger mental disorders. Sometimes make better for some people but the ones it makes it worse for, it tends to be a lot worse or trigger a condition your prone too. Your anxiety isn't HPPD. 

If you carry that much pride and confidence you have it get diagnosed with it. Who knows. You could just have anxiety and wig yourself out over things you think are visual. Anxiety does weird shit. If your super unlucky you could have triggered schizophrenia or Depersonalization/derealization. 

Maybe I'm over reacting but I swear everyone is flipping shit about HPPD and just telling people ""google it and see if this is it"" or they self diagnose themselves with google. For fucks sake If I trust google diagnosing me I am diabetic, suffering 7 different mental disorders, have 4 different types of cancer including a brain tumor. Did I mention I also have weird shit according to google like slipping rib syndrome and hyper extension in my knees or some shit?

And if you do suspect you have it and want to actually do anything about it. Stay sober until it goes away. Don't smoke weed to deal with it, because it won't help. If it's so fucking distressing to you, you would sober up. The only drugs you should be doing are the ones prescribed to you and aren't extremely psychoactive that give you the ""gone"" or ""high"". 

And if it's really that bad see a psychiatrist and ask and explain why you think they have it, either they will let you know if you have it or if you don't. You didn't go to college for 8+ years to diagnose yourself. They did. An accurate diagnoses is vital for treating it as certain medicines can make it worse. And some make it better. And good news. In 50% of patients it normally goes away completely within 5 years by itself without any help even. With professional help your chances are a lot higher.

And again. I'm not trying to downplay anyone who has it as it can be debilitating, like any mental disorder if severe enough. But I do believe people are kind of jerk circling about it like it's some sort of secret cool kids club and it's cool they fucked there mental state.

Don't worry young homie. Your gonna be fine. You all have a whole life ahead of you. 

TLDR: i just think many people self diagnose it and it isn't cool, according to google I can diagnose myself with anything. If your going around claiming you have it with a diagnoses get fucked. And if you keep continuing to do LSD and smoke mad reefer daily and get anxiety, you most likely don't have HPPD as your never sober. So possibly fuck off for that. It isn't trendy to be mentally ill. It blows cock. If you think you have it get professional help.

the apartement 

I lost track of the the extremums of the rope, nothing felt intact or in place anymore, the whole world was so chaotic and i could taste every aspect of the chaos, every layer of it.
I could taste the anxiety the moment i put that stamp in my mouth, i could feel it all over me, an aura of bad vibes that’s  getting bigger and bigger every time you think about it, i was in this cube and the whole world seized to exist , nothing has ever existed and nothing will ever exist, I’m trapped in this cube that keeps on turning into a sphere and i’m never leaving it because there’s nothing but the void outside of it, im laughing it out, it’s all in my head and then i’m crying of that realization and guilt. 
i lost track of reality the moment i stopped feeling like a solid entity, I can’t lay down anymore, because when i do i start to sink into this bed , being part of it, its taking over my whole moisty body, im morphing into this new thing and i m never getting out ever again, then vertigo keeps on kicking in and i feel trapped with all my negative toxic vibes in that state where im no longer a shape. I couldn’t tell if i was up or down or left or right,  i had the sensation of being the whole atmosphere, like im all over the place, I dont know where each part of my body is, i don’t know where the words nor the toughts are coming from, 
Staring at my phone and being absorbed into it, being part of it, the act of typing was out of habit and i didnt know how i was doing it, it was just happening somehow and i couldnt figure out how can a liquid control a screen or be part of it.
people all over me felt like bad liquids that will emerge into me and leave their sunken shit in me and i felt like running away from everything and everyone because of their bad vibes, even tho i was bad vibes myself, i was so dirty and i was just floating all over the place leaving drops of my identity and memories in everything i touch or walk on until i  could no longer remember who or what i was before. i lost track of what reality felt like, the act of walking, having a body and being a solid shape, a person, having a brain instead of being a brain, i could feel the acid frying my brain, splashing it, erasing my identity, i could no longer remember what i looked like, where is my mouth and why does the world tastes like ashes and burnt cigarettes, i could taste it with all my body, because i didnt know where i start or where i end, i m all over the place.
all of this was happening in this loop where the rope doesnt have a beggining nor an end, everything was happening over and over and over again and it felt like an eternity, i have been stuck in this apartement  for ages and i m now aware of it, reality has never existed and i am never leaving this loop of thoughts, this aparetmet full of lunatics where everyone is panicking and screaming and moving, the atmosphere tasted like loud and clear corpses and it was so blah, it was so horrifying and yet so hilarious, i could taste insanity, i could feel it, i was insanity myself and it was a terrible place to be in.
the only link i had with reality was the poor cat jumping all over me, it s touching my back but i can feel him all over me since i am a liquid, i can feel him being alive, he was full of good vibes and i was tainting him with my toxicity, i felt like mud, and i was putrefying the poor cat, dragging him in the way i dragged everyone, i realised it was my bad trip, i started the bad trip and dragged everyone down with me, one after the other. they were my horrible decisions that brought all of these poor people into this place to the verge of insanity and i was so aware of it.
i felt bad for all of them, i wanted them all to be fine, i  have been worried about them for too long that i forgot why i was worrting in the first place, the loop took the cause away and left me with this bad feeling in my guts that lasted all night long.
i left the apartement
An existential crisis where i know everything and yet i know nothing, i can understand how the whole world works, i could see the algorithms, how everything is linked to everything and why i have been living in this loop for ages
the sky has never been this beautiful, it was a painting where every star is so clear, the blue was so satisfying to look at and yet, it was me, i was feeling like shit and the beautiful sky couldnt fix it, nothing can ever fix how wrong the world is, the taste of melancholy in my mouth has been getting more intense and intense and i couldnt explain it to anyone.
My room
my friend and i were laying down in a bed trying to understand what happened, trying to drag each other out of the loop, convincing ourselves that we r getting better, time is moving forward, but still everything lost its sense, good and bad, love, time, evil, reality, nothing made sense anymore, it was all over us and the idea of never going back to our normal states was horrifying.

My skin is somewhat pale but my lips don't appear blue, my breathing is a bit shallow although I can still breathe fine,and also, I feel very tired and shaky like it's a bit hard to stay awake, although I still can, and my heartrate is actually slightly raised, although this might be anxiety. I've felt like this for about 30 minutes now, and I haven't ""passed out"" or whatever, and it hasn't gotten any worst than before, but I'm wondering what I should do now?

I was tripping so hard that when she was asleep, I thought her eyes were open, and I thought she just wasn't looking at me, I thought she was mad at me. The rest of the night was good, I felt less anxious after she and my friends girlfriend left. On the comedown I hit some dabs. When I woke up, I felt, just terrible. I couldn t think syraight, and all I wanted to do was go home. I got my things together and I walked back to my house. I told my gf I needed to be alone, and I really did. I went home and laid in bed. But when she got upset I decided to just suck it up and go see her. When I did, she was drunk again, which made me really unhappy, I never liked when she drinks, because she just turns into someone else. I hit three more big dabs, and then my head was just spinning.

33944,Long Post,"Benzos - Tolerance, Quitting them, and Withdrawals. Am I freak of Nature?","I'll try and keep this brief but it's not a brief story-

&amp;#x200B;

so here's my TL'DR(and sorry it's as short as I could make it)  

&amp;#x200B;

For 5 years i was prescribed kpins used most days but never built much tolerance- thought that was weird. got cut off cold turkey and was ok- seemed strange to me I didn't really have w/ds. Then found RCs. at first used as I had but then due to special circumstances usage went up to 10-15- even 20 mg daily. Sometimes more, for probably 6 or so months.  Now my tolerance is blown(though 20 actually still gives me a TINY, short buzz. I knew I needed to quit but tapering wasn't getting me anywhere. I'm experimenting with cold turkey(like the docs did before) and the worst symptoms I'm having is depression and some anxiety. 

I am keeping a handful nearby in case seizure level w/ds hit but I'm on day 6 of cold turkey and again and just feeling some depression and anxiety and MOST OF ALL irritation that I abused my ""magic pills"" to the point where what once seemed to be such a useful tool in getting through my days are now essentially useless.  I know it can take longer than six days for real w/d to hit so I'm bracing myself.  

Literature I've read says they can hit in the first 1-4 days then hit hard and acutely starting at 1 week, and can peak at week two then subside- but maybe last months or years depending on how you've used/abused/and your personal brain chemistry.   

My question is 1. Wtf is wrong with me?  Why didn't 5 years of regular use ever build tolerance, and then them cutting me off cold turkey give me the mildest of withdrawals? And 2. Again I'm six days into not using after a 10-20 mg per day habit for six months with only a few t breaks here and there. So far some anxiety and depression that, actually junk food and staying busy are helping keep at bay. Why am I not falling to pieces? Having panic attacks? Seizures? Could be around the corner but...wtf is wrong with me?  Maybe I'm 8 days away from the worst of it? Maybe I'm a blessed freak of nature? Maybe I'm going to seize out after submitting this post? Has anyone here had any kind of similar experience? Really went hard on a highly addictive drug with potentially deadly w/ds and then just...walked away?  And my other question- anyone wonder if my tolerance will ever reset? a month? 6? a year or 2? I don't know if I ever want to use again I'm more curious than anything...will these drugs ever even work on me again properly? 

\*\*LONG VERSION:\*\*

 I was prescribed 1-2 mg Kpins for 5 years at least fairly consistently with the  last 2 being completely consistently and used them every day for anxiety, occasionally using more than the prescribed dose to get high. Then my doc cut me off cold turkey.  I had some rebound anxiety and was not happy about it, but was ok(given what I've heard this is not typical, should have had way worse withdrawals and was risking seizure).  

Then discovered I RCs. Started ordering etizolam and went back to a 1-2mg daily usage sometimes a few more to get high.  

Then I attempted to backpack a long distance trail (over 2000 miles) I brought along my trusty happy pills, that also provided muscle relaxation and help sleeping- all clutch on such an arduous trip as you can imagine.  Anyone here who is a fan of benzos knows that if they hit you right, the euphoria is unbelievable and you just feel like nothing can get you down.

&amp;#x200B;

I was taking a few potentiaters as well and taking days off here and there when I could.  I usually liked to dose up when i have 1.7 miles left to go to camp and float in, even over hard terrain.  At first it started with a couple of pills every day, that become 10 per day, then maybe a few to help me sleep, soon it was 20 a day and sometimes just, a handful.  Thought I had never really built tolerance before, I knew I was building it now.  I knew this was stupid but the goal of completing the trail came before my own safety and health (I mean in more ways than one, I literally hiked by mother bears with her cubs, shared turf with three different types of venomous snakes, the risk of getting lost was always out there, and a storm blowing through and blowing a tree or branch onto your tent killing you is a thing that happens out there, it's not an EXTREMELY dangerous trip, but due to accident usually, 1 person dies out on this trail every couple years(and I think there's been like 9 murders?) 

&amp;#x200B;

So the mission came before knowing the risk I was putting at myself with these benzos and my abuse of them.  There were a few days where I probably consumed 40(maybe 1-2.) Let me just say here I know this is incredibly stupid and no one should ever abuse benzos, or even start using them if they can manage it.  And if you do- follow doctors orders.  Thought they were a godsend to me to help manage anxiety/depression - picking up a series of mindfulness habits and a healthier lifestyle and more therapy(yes I was in therapy) would have helped just as much if I could have stuck to it.  But I had bad anxiety and depression and the fact that a little pill could make it alllll go away for several hours was just too enticing and miraculous.

&amp;#x200B;

But as I hiked- though I covered an impressive percentage of the trip, I could never get going fast enough(I kept running into little issues that would slow me down, and never let me get my ""hiker legs"" meaning I could hike 20-30 miles a day, I was barely comfortable with 10, and if started to get cold.  My last day on trail I woke up with frozen shoes and knew for the moment I was done.  I headed back home though, with still enough money, to make another attempt once it got warm again to spend the next 6 months getting into the best shape, fixing all the bugs in my system and putting a plan together.  

&amp;#x200B;

Buuuuut I still wanted my midday anti anxiety kick or even better a midday high. So I kept at my usual usage 10-20 pills per day.  Once I went 5 days without and was fine.  Several more single day t breaks.  But now I'm just bummed that it takes 20 to maybe get the slightest bit of high or euphoria and know that I'm running out of time(or may already be out) on this clock I have that seems to make my brain...resistant to w/ds at least out to the six day mark after these huge doses.  I do know I'm not out of the woods on acute, or protracted w/ds for several more weeks.  Maybe months.  I have a stash for emergencies and some gabapentin as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm just ready to stop.  Cold turkey. I'm on day 6. I do hope someday I could have a tolerance reset and NOT be in such a crazy situation such as the trip I took ever made taking 10-20 a day an option and could use them occasionally for anxiety.  From what I've read after a few WEEKs the kpins I was prescribed back in the day should have had my tolerance rising and it never did.  Also from what I've read I should be having horrible anxiety, panic attacks, seizures and be completely not functioning and again...mostly I'm just bummed.  I know acute withdrawal is supposed to peak at week 2 so let's see how I'm feeling then.  But has anyone just...I don't know had a freak of nature brain with benzos like this?  Am I the luckiest person in the world?  As long as I don't start having mega level life threatening w/ds should I just never touch the stuff again? Or if I can go a month, six months, a year, whatever maybe get a full tolerance reset am I allowed to take my one mg once in a while and have all my problems fade away for a few hours?  Let me just say- I wish I had just face my problems without meds ever.  But that's a lot harder work.  I went through a terrible trauma and had some other major issues that caused depression and anxiety but that all could have been addressed with some hard work.  And was being addressed as best I could I guess but the pills also were just too easy.  Just too magical that I could swallow something and that trauma and depression would be gone for several hours after 30 minutes or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I just wonder- anyone go through an experience like this and get out without extreme w/ds? Anyone go through an experience like this and ever reset their tolerance, then never abuse again but use occasionally and effectively?  Am I just a freak of nature? Or am I going to be seizing out by tomorrow morning?  Thanks all, stay safe out there please, and if you find yourself using a drug just to make all the problems go away I don't blame you esp if it's a less dangerous one than benzos. But consider any other means or methods that make the problems go away too.  I'm fine but unhappy.  I think I'll find my way to happiness and see a path to sobriety and addressing problems the hard way, but with this place I've put myself in, pretty sure the pit I've got to crawl out of is wayyyyyyyyyyy deeper than if I kept drugs out of it.  I didn't use to enhance my life, properly treat a medical issue, or occasionally on special occasions.  I used a distraction from problems that I should have just dealt with.  Because now that the magic pills don't work anymore I have to deal with the problems anyway, AND I may have given myself an addiction problem/withdrawal hell to deal with as well.

Alt account for privacy reasoning.

So last night the night finally came, trying MDMA with a close friend for the first time,  
Im gna try to describe the experience as good as possible, but note that im still kinda blurred by the impact of this experience

*20:00 -* We had dinner, chilling on the couch, and decide to spark up a joint and either pop the pills right away or wait another hour depending on how we feel, the weed gets us absolutely couchlocked and we decide to wait another hour,

*21:00 -* A friend of the buddy im with hits us up asking if he can smoke some weed and/or chill along, we tell him that hes welcome to join us but that we are gonna take some pills knowing he doesnt wanna do anything stronger then weed, he agrees on it and comes over, we decide to smoke another joint and wait another hour,

*22:00/22:30* Our stoned starts to flow away, and we get in the mood to take the pills, we tell the friend were about to use the pills so he can leave if hes uncomfortable with us, he decides to stay with us. We both start with half a pill, our pills were about 150-200MG MDMA so i tought half a pill would be enough in general

*00:00* \- We waited somewhere around 1.5 hours by now and feel little to no effects, we decide to take another half of a pill

*00:45 -* Somewhere around half an hour to 45 minutes later this second half hit us, we were both rolling decent but really wanted more, we decide to take a full extra pill, so double the dose because ""*We could easily handle dubble this high*"" terrible descision, iknow

*01:30* \- soooo, the second pill just hit us, the following hour is spent watching a movie and hugging each other, for me it was mentally and emotionally pretty confronting, i really started realizing all the flaws in my life, how much i loved this guy, and how much our friendship went to waste over the last years

*02:30 -* Now the emotional effects slowly fade away and the physical effects really hit me, im full on hugging a pillow bc the sensation trough my body is so great, we turn on some heavy, high tempo EDM/bass music, and at that point i fully leave planet earth,

Everytime i close my eyes i seem to drop in a room full of pleasure and calmth, as if falling and drowning into a pool filled with pleasure, within moments the music hits me again and fullfills my entire life, this process happens everytime i relax again troughout the night and seems to take ages but is really just a fraction of a second,

I cant stop repeating it; the music is sooooo amazing, ever single tone in the music heavily vibrates alltroughout my body leaving intense, orgasm-a-like feelings altroughout every single part of my body, at some points i cannot contain my breath and uncontrollably start minorly moaning/gasping bc of all the pleasure flowing trough my body.

*03:30 - 07:00 (i lost all track of time, i know i felt back 2 sober around 7) -* We can all agree that my dose (somewhere between 300-350 MG) is extremely high for a first time, i had been warned for minor psychedellic effects during the peak/comedown, besides vibrant lights i had none during the start of my peak so i wasnt expecting them at all anymore,

When my peak is at it absolute max i start having some minor hallicunations, the entire process of falling into peace and continueing to almost ride the music i just described got way heavier, everytime i fell into that ""trance"" i started tunnelvisioning onto a single point in the room and feeling like i was racing to that point trough a tunnel of toughts, while bing guided by the music, its hard to explain but it felt like everytime i relaxed reality was completely simplified -

[as if all of reality changed into these kinda graphics](http://imageshack.us/i/pode4LbRj)

to then be interpeted by my brain wich would then go along to hallicunate its own world in it, its extremely hard to explain, but was a mix of interesting, pleasant, confronting, and scary at times, it really felt like i was exploring my own mind

whats also interesting that everytime after a certain period in this pleasant flashing trough mind while hallicunating state id get a glimp of reality in some way; ""Someone saying something to me, a clear tought about why this is fake, or something else in realitie that attracted my attention"" As soon as this happened id feel as if being pulled back trough that tunnel of toughts and forcfully smacked back into reality

*I remember a specific situation where my friend was standing next to me with his phone with charging attached to it, when falling into this ""Trance"" my mind changed his phone into a shaver and the room changed into a eastern barber store - ish environment, then he stepped at me grinning as an evil barber whos gonna shave me all bald, just for me to realize its fake again and flash back into reality seeing that he didnt move an inch and that that was all made up by my mind causing me to flash back into reality immediatly*

*07:00 -* After a long time of experiencing all these effects i realize im just pretty stoned and sober for the rest, i feel great and fall asleep quick, then to wakeup a couple of hours later with a jaw that hurts as never before and not a single sign of water to be spotted in my mouth

Overall an amazing and overwhelming experience! Cant wait to do it again!

The 2 days afterwards i was still really buzzed and out of it by the MDMA, i didnt neccisarely feel happier but more as if the MDMA gave me the possibilty to be happier, as if my mind was cleared of all negative energy, its refreshing, and shows me how mentally healthy using drugs in a proper way can be

But. Beyond that. 

It was like a felt true happiness. Feels corny and cliche to say but god damn. No huge realizations or epiphanies but to not be depressed for a few hours and to genuinely like living. It was unbelievable. 

Husband tried to play Borderlands (our favorite game) and we made it through several game menus before giving up and just watching and listening to the game. 

And then came the come down. It hit me like a fucking ton of bricks. I was suddenly anxious again. Real life came back in full force and I couldn’t stop crying. My head wanted to explode and I was HUNGRY. But I didn’t want to eat. Borderline suicidal- what’s the point of anything? Like every regret and guilt trip came at me at once. My husband eventually started playing the game and he looks over at me “wow you look like shit”. YEAH I FEEL LIKE IT TOO. FUCK YOU.

34212,LSD,Questioning my acid brain,"Hi there fellas, I tripped just last weekend and during the trip I had come to the realization that I don't feel I belong at the University I'm going to at the moment. For some background, I go to school in a very conservative state and since I had gotten here, I had run ins with many people who I initially thought were chill, until they would say some backhanded comment about my sexuality once they had realized that I had a partner of the same sex. I am a very open minded person and don't really lean conservative at all and so this was a culture shock for me immediately. Back to the story, I was with some pals still tripping and someone said ""Yeah being transgender is a disease"" and proceeded to compare being transgender to someone with downs syndrome. I was shocked and my heart started racing a bit once I heard this because the comment made me so uncomfortable. I do not agree with this statement about transgender people at all and I feel that such a statement is something said out of ignorance and lack of knowledge. I also know that I cannot put a whole University into a specific box of being ""conservative"" and ""close minded"" just from one comment. That being said though, I have heard comments of the same level of ignorance about my own sexuality and all that kinda stuff, and in my tripping head I was thinking, ""if someone feels comfortable enough to say something like that without taking a second to understand their audience, then that completely says something about their own environment and the people that live and go to school here"". Since this night, I have been looking at schools in different areas and am looking to apply and leave where I am now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this post is long, but basically I'm wondering if this reaction to a thought while tripping is actually valid, or if it was just me overthinking during a trip and trying to find reasons to leave where I am at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I am curious if anyone else has had a ""realization"" of this level while tripping and whether yall took it seriously and actually changed your life because of a thought while tripping and if it ended up working out or not. I'd love to hear about some others' personal experiences with these kinds of thoughts and dilemmas during a trip and how you fellas dealt with it afterwards once sober.

About 7 hours into the trip I can start to tell that I'm coming down. It was around 9 at night and I wanted to be able to sleep and had some moments of anxiety throughout the trip. I grabbed a couple of klonopins (which I'm prescribed) and took 1.5mg to see if it would be a ""trip killer""

However I found out that this is a fantastic combination especially for dealing with a come down. The rest of the night I had some mild visuals and just felt incredible with the benzos. I even woke up the next morning feeling very refreshed which has never really happened to me after an acid trip.

34264,Psychedelics,1.2g shroom trip equivalent to previous 7.5g trip?,"Hello all, 
Yesterday I went on my fourth trip, a (normally) light 1.2g dose of golden teachers. My previous trips had been 2.5, 4.0, and then a 7.5g. First trip, 2.5g, was excellent, didn’t get any visuals besides color contrast, but felt good about life and myself, warm and happy was the theme of that trip, but I never got very “deep” into my own head, I felt it was very surface level, hence making me want to truly experience a real in depth trip. I got this from The 4.0 trip, it went perfectly, most blissful experiences I’ve ever felt, felt warm and connected to everything, met with overwhelming sense of love and appreciation. My most recent trip besides the 1.2g dose was 7.5, and that was my first time experiencing ego death. I tripped in the Forest with one other friend and a trip sitter, needless to say I was blown out of my body and into the depths of my consciousness and space. That trip was mostly pleasant, I essentially ‘fell asleep’ and had a wonderful 3hrs of detachment from reality, bounding off other entities in my mind that were friendly and reminded me of my own friends personalities looking back on it. The last hour took a turn for the worse, I was getting stuck in uncomfortable mental loops, I couldn’t differentiate what’s real and what isn’t, was it all in my head? Were my memories real? Was I just a conscious entity who’s entire surrounding was a fabrication of my own creation? Was I alone in this universe? This last hour of the trip was challenging. It was scary, but I was still basically asleep and not moving which I think helped me regain control a bit and relax. Integrating the trip was challenging still, but after a day or so I was truly appreciative of the experience and was glad I went through some rough patches in it to help accentuate the good parts even more However, my trip yesterday went almost exactly the same, and felt as if I had taken another heroic dose, but much scarier. 
3:08pm - ate 1.2g of dried golden teachers on the car ride to my favorite local longboarding spot (surf) driven there with one of my best friends. 
3:40pm - arrived Surfed on the come up, super blissful and felt very in control, no visuals besides excellent color sharpness and acuity. No sense of fear, anxiety or nervousness. 
4:15pm - Buddy gets stung by a sting ray and foots bleeding (been surfing for long time, never been stung but know how to treat them) we pack up car and head to a local lifeguard station to soak foot in hot water, he’s soaking foot and I paddle back out in new spot (also very familiar with this spot, nothing new) surfed for another 30 mins feeling good. Still no worries 
5ish pm - pack up the car and begin to head home, as were packing up the car I begin to feel a sense of fear, anxiety and nervousness building inside me. Try to relax and remind myself I took a small dose, it’ll blow over. Put on relaxing music and focus on conversing with my friend about how great sunset is. By the time we get to his house I’m full on tripping, decent visuals (not as intense as 7.5g trip but still strong) but the mental mindset was near identical to 7.5g trip, only much scarier. 
6pm- arrive at his house,  first thing I do is Yeet the remaining 5ish grams of shrooms I had into nearest trash can without hesitation, all I’m thinking is fuck this. look at him and go “David I’m freaking out rn, I need a hug and I need you tell me we’re safe” he does this but I get stuck in mental loop that none of this is actually real, all figment or imagination. Sensation of falling down the rabbit hole consumes me. He helps me to his room where I lie down and am shivering under his covers (SoCal weather at 6pm is about 70 degrees last night) and couldn’t get warm. Stuck in terrifying mental loop for about an hour, no music is helping, tried to put on YouTube videos to ground me but nothing helps. I’m checking my watch every 10 seconds to see how much time as passed which only makes it worse, feels like Forever. Can’t remember if time is real, couldn’t remember name or if I was human, what I looked like etc etc. all I could do was sit in a waterfall of fear and anxiety. 
7:30ish pm - finally coming out of it slowly. Get some food in me, drink water and go to bathroom. Slowly rebuilding world around me. Eventually by 7:45 I’m feeling back to normal but shaken up and rattled. 

So my question is, has anyone else had something similar happen to them? Can a heavy dose really make you that much more sensitive to psychedelics? How is it possible I tripped equally hard on 1.2 as 7.5? 

Ps. Yes I know set and setting is paramount, the sting ray drama for sure didn’t help but I still don’t see that as a viable answer to how powerful that trip could be. ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aktf20/12g_shroom_trip_equivalent_to_previous_75g_trip/

This is at about 11pm btw. We were sad we had cart left but we're excited to do something a lil different. So basically they each dropped their 75 mics. The girl who bought a bar off of me popped hers. I took 1/4 of a bar then had thought about snorting it. So I took another quarter off my bar and crush it up and made a straw with paper to snort it. Within 5 minutes I already feel the xanax but witch it felt much more noticeable and intense. So of course I snorted the other half bar I had left. Was very fun.

34502,Cannabis,Any social situation is impossible if I smoke pot. How do you do it?,"I'm not a heavy stoner, so maybe this is part of it.

My experience with weed in the past was rather negative. Any time I got even a small buzz, I'd be hyperaware that I was stoned and I was super anxious around anyone. I'm in Canada, so once legalisation happened I started experimenting again.

Now, I've found my sort of tolerance level, comfortable area, and I love it. Problem is, I am completely socially useless during the time (2+ hours) that I'm not sober.

If I get a phone call, I just cannot answer it. If there's a knock on my door, I get extremely paranoid and get this sense of dread. I try to go outside and take a walk, but it feels overwhelming. Yesterday my neighbour started talking to me in the corridor, and although I understood everything perfectly, I couldn't respond more than ""yeah"". I don't even care about the smell or people knowing, it's just what happens when I smoke or use oil.

Some people I know smoke first thing in the morning and go to work/uni/whatever. I can't even take a single hit without having to hide away while ignoring the rest of the world for hours. No, CBD doesn't help. It isn't even a ""too high"" thing. For the most part, the strains I've used have been blue dream, hindu kush, and cannatonic. I'm convinced that apart from THC/CBD content, the differences between strains are as valid as astrology.

The problem is that I love weed, but only when I'm completely and utterly isolated with no risk of human contact. I don't live in a shack in the forest (and of course I have responsibilities), so obviously this isn't possible.

For those of you that smoke and then go about your day, how? Were you always like this? Do I have any hope of being able to function?

I was doing my work pretty rapidly and kept going until about 1-2am. I finished my work, and noticed a dull pain around my shoulders and chest. I brushed it off as just being pain from slumped over my computer for so long. Unsurprisingly, I was unable to sleep. After a couple frustrating hours, I noticed I was having minor hallucinations, and started becoming slightly concerned. After another hour or so, the pain from my chest and shoulder spread to my heart, which is a BIG red flag. The pain became so intense I couldn't lay down, walk, or BREATHE comfortably without being in intense pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 7am, my heart began to hurt badly. I went to the nearest hospital and checked into the ER. I live in a major US city, so it took a considerable amount of time to get in. After finally being introduced to a doctor, I explained my symptoms. They did an X-ray and found a dangerous amount of oxygen that had leaked from either my trachea, esophagus or another oxygen transporting organ. After multiple CT scans they could find no tears or signs of tears in my body, and were absolutely perplexed. They had to admit me into the hospital because of the possibility of oxygen levels increasing which would lead to possible rupture or internal bleeding around my lungs/heart. After a night at the hospital (and LOTS of morphine/hydrocodone) they had diagnosed me with [Pneumothorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumothorax) but could not come with a probable reason why. In the moment, I did not consider the Adderall I took to have anything to do with it, but during the real comedown of the drug I noticed the oxygen levels decreased naturally without surgery. After three days, I was sent home with no probable cause and very low oxygen levels. Many cases of pneumothorax are caused by trauma or the increase of smoking a foreign object (I rarely smoke if ever). Neither of which triggered this.

Every since then, I have not experienced the symptoms at such a scale. I have noticed when I took Adderall a few times after with a lower dose, that  I did experienced a small amount of pain in my shoulders and chest. Doctors were still stumped when I left. If anyone has any information or possible reason as to why this had happened I would love to hear!

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; 40mg Adderall probably made my lungs and heart get damaged due to high pressure amounts of oxygen leaking from my body somewhere.",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akv7i6/40mg_of_adderall_and_no_food_put_me_in_the/

34542,Psychedelics,My most visually spectacular trip was on dph (Benadyrl),"I've taken 9 grams of shrooms, I've taken breakthrough doses of DMT, I've wet my toe with 2 tabs of acid, but the most visual trip I've ever had by far is dph. The broke man's mistake.

I didn't see spiders crawling on the walls I didn't see the ceiling melt, but I did see myself smoking an imaginary joint and I saw myself scrolling through Reddit on an imaginary phone. I really saw it, I really felt it, I could even focus on them. The only way I could tell the phone wasn't real is because when I squinted at it I didn't recognize the apps I had. I was convinced I was smoking a joint until I went to ash it and my bare hand tapped the tray instead. 

It was so natural, like I pulled out my phone on instinct and there it was, the imaginary phone with apps that weren't real. I could feel it leaving my pocket, I could feel it in my hand, I even felt a slight eye burn from the brightness of the phone, but once I snapped out of it my hand was empty and my phone was in my pocket, never removed. Keep in mind this is all Open eye visuals, the CEV's were just insane. 

I closed my eyes and shoved my face in my pillow. It felt like I had made a huge mistake and nothing would be the same again. I knew I had taken just drugs but that feeling of angst and terror and guilt wouldn't go away. The pillow helped, and I started to relax a bit. That's when the CEV's kicked in. Suddenly I was standing in a tundra during some sort of blizzard (fast moving snow fell in front of me and flew past my eyes). I noticed a tree, and it made me want to look away. I looked to the side and I saw this beast. I can only describe its body as ape-like, muscular and hunched over like a gorilla, grey chest with white hairs flowing with the wind. It's body was generally normal but it's face was an ass. It's face was blocky but met in sort of a pyramid shape at the top, it was very furry but I could tell it was an ass by it's shape. It turned and focused on me, that's when I got scared and opened my eyes. The rest of the trip was about the same, pulling out my phone but first checking to see if the apps were real before trying to use it.

Although it was a painful, scary, throwupy trip, it was the most visually intense trip I have ever had. I'm thinking about trying datura. ",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/akvg6h/my_most_visually_spectacular_trip_was_on_dph/

Cut some strands of hair.

Stared blankly some more into the mirror and my mind drifted into the eternal abyss of my subconscious.

Then I grabbed the electric razor and shaved it all off.

Up and down left and right my curly strands of hair fell and even as I began to bald I still thought nothing.

34623,Cannabis,"Combining weed and antidepressants, euphoric mania","so a 6 months ago I was prescribed the SNRI pristiq (50mg), during that time i was smoking marijuana and I noticed That every time I smoked I felt really energized and motivated, I would become hyper social and hang out with friends or go talk to random people on the street, which is odd because weed usually makes me socially anxious. I couldn't eat and ended up losing about 12 kg, my sleep was terrible to i would nap for 2 hours a night yet not feel tired the next day. Obviously my use of marijuana increased dramatically and it was all i spent my money on, interestingly if i had a cold shower it would have almost the same effect but milder. If i couldn't get weed however it was like hell, I would feel extremely depressed and be wanting to kill myself. Girls were attracted to me, I was funny as hell it was pure bliss. I stopped going to class and would just smoke bongs at school with my friends, this wasn't to have fun however if i went to long without weed than I started to get depressed so this was a necessity. It all came crashing down however when one night I had way to many bong hits, when i get out of bed and sat at the my computer this really loud buzzing began in my ears, my heart rate skyrocketed and i could feel it thumping my chest, my vision had white squares in it blinding me the buzzing got louder and louder. I felt extreme terror. I rushed out to my dad and told him i needed an ambulance he asked why and when I told what happened he was pretty angry and told me to sit on the couch with my head between my knees this helped and minutes later I was fine. I still wanted to go to the hospital but my dad wouldn't take me and that it was just a whitey. After doing some research i think it was an overdose of norepinephrine which is pretty serious and I think I have brain damage from it. He asked for my weed and i gave him most of it and said that was it. That night I experienced extreme paranoia and would jump out of my window and hide in the bushes because i thought i heard someone in the house. after it would wore off around 5 Am I smoked the last of my weed, My dad finally took me to the Gp and she prescribed me a stronger form of seroqoul called quitaipane After taking the pill my dad couldn't be bothered  dealing with me and handed me off to my mum, on Their way to her house I hadnt had weed in about 9 hours or something like that, I was in the car with my little sister and mum When i felt this intense craving to smoke weed The quitapine hadn't kicked in yet and i started writhing and moaning its hard to describe but It was definitely some kind of withdrawal not to pristiq mind you as i was still taking that. When The pill finally worked i Started slurring my words and could hardly move My mum was pretty freaked out and took me to the hospital I was kept there and they kept asking if id taken anything else and said no just weed and pristiq when the quitapine wore off The craving came back and i started thrashing and screaming I was so bad they had to give me valium to calm down. They told me that the weed antedepresants and long cold showers had pottentuated the pristiq the point it was like id been on meth everyday for months and that the next two weeks withdrawing would be the hardest in my life they gave my mum some valium and two wafers of a pill they use for poeple with extreame grief depressio to stop the craving and sent me home. the next two weeks i wanted to die and my mum cut me off the pristiq aswell (she wasn't meant to) so i was going cold turkey on everything and wanted to die. Im writing this a few months later as a bit of catharsis All i really want to do is get back on pristiq i've smoked weed since but its not the same I also know two guys that are on pristiq and they say weed doesn't feel any different but when they do smoke I can tell there manic, lucky bastards.

34779,I :love: Drugs,When did you start doing drugs and what were you doing?,"I started around age 13, 17 now. 

13- Smoked weed for the first time with friends maybe toked a dozen times before I was 14. 

14-A high school girl gave me half of prescription Xanax (2mg) while I was smoking and it put me on my ass, blacked out. Continued smoking weed about every weekend. 
 
15-Got drunk for the first time at a house party with some older friends I knew through graffiti, drank 4 or 5 PBRs and tried to Mack on girls 6 years older than me, became addicted to American Spirit cigarettes, started smoking weed at least 3 times a week, tried mushrooms during a hurricane with friends and fell in love. Took 3 points of MDMA with my first lover (by far my favorite drug) have only used 4 times since then. Soon developed a minor Xanax habit toward my 16th year. 

16-Became heavily addicted to Xanax during the summer, smoked weed daily, drinking at least 2 or 3 times a week, tried cocaine for the first time during spring break with friends, started using coke bi monthly or so after that, and soon it became about once or twice a month, tried LSD 3 or 4 times and had a really gnarly bad trip the last time I used it alone. Tried Meth twice, once on Xanax and one horrible experience where I ended up staying awake for two days, I never used again. Used a lot of Xanax to cope with the anxiety and paranoia I would get in the months after and started drinking heavier when I would drink. Slowed down on weed a bit. Still using Xanax weekly, Two of my best friends introduced me to dmt, I had an amazing and positive experience that left me with a really happy afterglow for days, soon after I stopped smoking weed completely, it was just never the same after dmt  if I’m being completely honest. Used adderall and vyvanse 2 or 3 times for school, never liked it too much but it made me hella productive. A month or so later I quit Xanax after tampering off. 

17- Around my 17th birthday I was using coke weekly , relapsed on Xanax and was drinking almost every day since I was out of school and heartbroken, trying to numb in all the wrong ways , this was one of the lowest points of my entire life, I dropped to 115 pounds and felt like shit all the time with a constant anxiety I had developed through drug abuse that I originally never had. I started therapy and worked through what I could. Soon after I quit Xanax again and was just drinking moderately and doing coke here and there, I tried ketamine 2 or 3 times and had some of the best drug experiences of my life with good friends and at a tommy wright show. My coke habit became a no doubt monthly thing , and the drinking was heavy every weekend (still is)Relapsed on Xanax again and used 4 or 5 times a month until about 3 months ago I have managed to cut it out completely. Still having issues with cocaine tho, as I have done it the past 2 weekends after taking a 3 week break. Since then I’ve tried to just cut off my plugs and have been drinking stupid amounts of caffeine.

Always with my boys or by myself(I don’t recommend doing acid by yourself) so instead of doing tabs with her I told her I’ll watch her as she takes her tabs one day and the next day I’ll take mine as she watched me. Looking back I wish we had taken them together. The experience would have been way more amazing.

First day comes and she takes her tab. I take her around the city to a few parks and some of my favorite trip spots. Just like most LSD first timers she starts talking shit saying it’s not working. I tell her give it some time. It finally kicks in for her. She’s laughing &amp; in awe of everything manipulating in front of her. It was a beautiful warm summer day and I took her to a pier. She was amazed by the water during the sunset. She loved it.

The next day it was my turn. Because I had done a lot of acid at this point of my life I decided to take 2 tabs instead of one this time around. I didn’t need to see any sights or be out for my trip. I told her I wanted to stay home. So we did. While tripping I made a playlist of really dark ambient sexual music such as FKA Twigs &amp; Spaceghostpurrps “Blackland Radio” mixtape. This put me in a certain mood I never felt. The acid is kicking in heavily.

I’m at the computer listening to the songs with my eyes closed in a trance. I feel like I can see the music. Taylor came over to check on me. I had almost forgotten she was in the room. We we’re at her house so she was dressed very comfortably. She mostly remained nude when at home and would wear this burgundy robe made of a silk kind of material. I opened my eyes to see her in this robe, it’s untied and I can see her body peeking through the center. She had this tattoo in the center of her chest that looked so amazing to me and she was smoking a blunt. With the smoke drifting from her mouth in that moment she looked like a sexual deviant to me.

We start messing around in her bed. Touching a person never felt like this before. Her skin felt holographic in my hands. The acid had my blood boiling. Fast forward to us having intercourse. I have my eyes closed the whole time. I never have sex with my eyes closed or with the lights off. The visual of a woman is what keeps me aroused, Not so much the physical feeling... if I get too caught up in the physical feeling I’ll cum fast and fuck that. But this time I was melting in the feeling. Nearly the entire time my eyes were closed and the LSD made the sounds of her moans give me chills. No molly or ecstasy has given me an experience like this.

I open my eyes to try to change into a position where I’m standing at the edge of the bed and she’s laying on the edge of the bed face up with her legs towards me. Her bed was kind of low so I had to put my hands under her waist and lift her body up a bit for her to reach me. I look down at her and the acid gave me a visual I never could imagine. The room was dark but her bathroom door was cracked open slightly and the light was on inside of it. The beam of light coming into her dark room was directly over her pussy and when I looked at it about to eat her out it gave me the illusion that her pussy was glowing. 

Her pussy was so pretty on a regular day but mixed with this acid , the music &amp; the lighting in the room looking at it made my jaw drop. As we continued I literally got lost in her and my mind put her body on the highest pedestal possible. I feel like the acid showed me the real beauty of a woman’s body on a scale I can’t explain. I didn’t express my experience to her until the next day when I was sober and she couldn’t believe it. She’d never felt so appreciated sexually. I wish we had took the tabs together instead of separately.

If you are a LSD user I highly recommend trying sex with a partner on acid but someone you trust and love. Sometimes on LSD i can’t have certain people around me so sexually I feel like it wouldn’t have been a good experience if it wasn’t someone I really cared about.

35094,Psychedelics,Don't ever underestimate the power of LSD,"This is the story of when I experienced a bad trip from LSD. I had been wanting to try LSD for some time and did a lot of research. My first time I did all the right stuff - set up a safe environment, with friends, did it with someone very experienced, had toys, trippy videos to watch, etc. Fell in love with it! Thought it was the most amazing experience and couldn't believe I was so nervous to try this amazing drug. I heard so many horror stories of people having bad trips even from my own friends, but I couldn't understand how that is even possible after my first experience with it. I loved the feeling I was experiencing so much I wanted to take another tab because I wanted to feel it stronger, but we didn't have anymore so I took a little shrooms instead. Overall, had an amazing first experience.

I love going to concerts where I usually will take mdma. I remember during my first trip thinking how LSD would make any concert so much more enjoyable compared to mdma, plus it's waaay cheaper. I now have this over confidence of LSD, (which I was very quickly humbled). I went to an out of town show with someone I had just started dating so I barely knew them. We then met up with a group of about 10-15 people I have never met. They had rented some bad ass penthouse overlooking the city to party in before and after the show. I was pretty pumped about the night ready to party thinking I am about to have a great time. The guy I was dating who is pretty experienced with LSD got us each 2 tabs. I am completely unaware of ug and all that. Shortly before we head to the show I pop 1 tab where I also plan to candyflip later. We begin to walk to the venue and that's when it starts to hit me. 

I won't go into it detail by detail, but I am basically retarded within the first 30 minutes of the show. I can barely form words. I need water so bad, and all I am able to say to my friend is water in hopes that he understands what I am trying to say. My depth perception is so off walking anywhere was a struggle. I remember filling up a cup of water later in the night thinking it was about to overflow only to realize it barely had any water in it when I went to drink it. For some reason I kept seeing these barriers everywhere that didn't actually exist. I would think I wouldn't be able to walk a certain way only to see the barrier gone when I walked closer. I was so overwhelmed by my environment I walked outside, but was even worse out there because I felt so alone. I felt like everyone was staring at me and all I could do was pace so I had to go back inside. Thank God some of the people in our group were wearing these hideous bright green shirts is the only way I was able to find the people I was with. Funniest part of the story is I look down at my phone and see my mother's face! At first I thought I was seeing shit, but nope accidentally Face Timed my super conservative mother. Fortunately she just thought I was drunk and didn't see much. Again, being barely able to talk all I could do was point my phone at one of the girl's faces that I knew was sober and saying the words ""mom"" to get her to help me hang up the damn call. I so badly wanted to just crawl into a corner and cry, but in my head I couldn't because I was in a different city with a bunch of people I didn't know. I felt that if I were to have this meltdown I would be on my own being that everyone there paid for this show and wasn't trying to take care of some random stranger. Again, I'm all in my head at this point. I just stood there with clenched fists telling myself this will eventually end - you just have to make it through the night. The person I was dating kept asking me if I was okay but I would just tell him I'll be okay and there's nothing he could do for me even though what I really wanted was to go back to our hotel room but I didn't feel comfortable enough with him at the time to tell him that. I even remember thinking that I would never be able to see/talk to this person after that night. 

At the end of the night when I'm over my peak but still tripping pretty hard I remember smoking a little bit in hopes that I would be able to actually get some sleep and relax. I didn't know that weed makes you trip harder so peoples' faces start melting once again - I'm fucking pissed at this point. I basically just sat in a chair not talking to anyone the whole night. 

There were a couple times in the night where I was able to just let go of the thoughts in my head and dance having fun, but my insecurities just kept coming back. The next day the guy I'm dating who took 2 tabs and is pretty experienced with LSD told me that was the hardest he has ever tripped in his life, so it was obviously much stronger than what I took the first time. Looking back, if I would have been more comfortable even with just the person I was dating I think it would have been a much better outcome. Basically, the point of this story is that LSD is a very powerful drug and you should become aware of it's effects before you go into a very stimulated environment, do it with people you aren't super comfortable with or alone, and definitely know what you're taking. I was very humbled by this experience and have been much more careful when taking LSD. 

I can happily say that I have successfully tripped multiple times since then even though I wasn't sure I'd ever do it again. I still think it's an amazing drug. It's now an experience I can look back at and laugh at. 

TLDR: Underestimated the effects of LSD at a concert with people I didn't know after successfully tripping my first time causing me to be way too overwhelmed and have a bad time.

35272,Long Post,Trying to get Sober of everything,"Hey friends! 

So before I say anything, I love drugs and I will most likely do these drugs again sometime. I just need to quit because it I can feel my mind is suffering. 

So a brief history of my drug use, I was a sober soul most of my life, until I turned 16. Before I turned 16 I smoked weed once and thought it was interesting but when I turned 16, that summer everyday I was trying to get high with weed anyway I could. I would go over to my friends house pretty much every day and we would skate to our friends house to pick up some nug or some edibles. smoking everyday was something new and it was a great escape from my family, when video games wont work. At the time I blamed my parents because they were fighting a lot and my dad was an alcoholic. In hindsight I realized that It was my choice to continue this path. 

Still smoking almost everyday till I turn 17. I got caught serval times because my mother would tear up my room trying to find any evidence of anything. So I quit smoking for about a year. This doesn't mean the drugs stopped. From 17-18, I tried hydros, oxys, kratom, LSD, Shrooms, coke (once), MDMA (once and didn't feel the effects) and alcohol (never was into it because of my dad, but I wasn't smoking at the time so i tried it out). Out of all these options I stuck with kratom the most because it was easy to find and to buy. keep in mind I did research these drugs as much as I could before taking them except from kratom. I just saw a vice documentary and tried some. I loved it but i would often take to much or have to much dry powder in my throat. 

When I turned 18 I calmed down a lot. I went back to just smoking weed and I picked up JUULing and drinking alcohol. Everything seemed to be fine till my senior summer going to college. A little backstory- I smoked a lot of weed and would always push myself beyond my limit, my throat is still suffering the consequences. Smoking all the time combined with the Juul must have messed me up somehow because I would start throwing up if i took too big of a hit. a lot of friends expressed genuine concern and I thank them for that but I was to hardheaded to realize. 

When I was 18 I was smoking daily and several times a day. I would maybe go 2-3 at MOST without getting high. also I was juuling everyday, whenever I ran out of pods (every 3-4 days) I would buy a new pack no second thought. The only way I could afford the pods was with my parents money, sorry parents but keep reading. I also just got into college around this time, so now that I have all this freedom, I was getting high at any chance I could get, when i wake up, before class, before and during hanging out with friends, anytime I did homework I was high, I took my finals freshmen year high as fuck for all 5 of my classes. Keep in mind, I still had a bad cough and threw up when I would push myself to hard. When I was about to turn 19, I noticed that my mental was slowly slipping. I did do much about it cuz I assumed it was just good weed lol. 

Flash forward to 2018 Oct I'm 19 and I try MDMA again and experience a roll (I think the first time I did MDMA I took a smaller dose than I should have. anyways I roll balls and have a blast while smoking and juuling the whole time. Then I did MDMA again in December for a concert. (next roll wont be till April lol) but after that roll I guess I had a life changing realization, I realized that a lot of the good friends I have, some of the only thing we have in common is drugs. I realized my hobbies were smoking weed and playing videos. I realized, that a lot of people like me more when im drunk, i can see that because its easier to talk to people but when I was sober I was great at talking with people. but since I started smoking everyday I feel like im slower, i feel like I can't say what I want to say, I feel like a lesser person because im always high. I feel like I can only fuck girls if Im drunk, I cant do it sober, because when i am sober I feel scared and I do not know what to do. For the past few years my main goal was passing school and finding a way to get high. I started losing more and more stuff, losing juuls, weed, hw etc. I would always forget the simplest things and I couldn't figure out why, I think it was the weed fog you get when you smoke a lot. I have had this fog for way longer than I ever should have. 

Since that roll, I quit juuling honestly I will sometimes hit other peoples juuls but it makes my stomach feel sick and now that I stopped juuling all the time, I get a buzz now. That Nic buzz has become so unappealing to me now. I still smoke weed daily but I only smoke once or twice a day compared to smoking 2-3times every few hours. Eventually I hope to quit smoking completely and live a sober life for a little bit. Trust me I have no issues with the drugs i've taken, its just how i've abused them throughout my life. Im still young and I subjugated my brain to so many drugs daily, that I know my brain wont be the same. I think I will still smoking weed but I know I can not continue smoking daily

Thank you reading, Idk if there was a really purpose for all of this, but i wanted to share my story and reddit is the perfect place. and for some reason this was relieving to say, i don't know why but no way I could of told all of this to someone I know, for various reasons. So for that I thank y'all 

this is a throwaway account btw

also little thing i wanted to add.  When i was in 18 smoking and juul everyday my cough was getting worse and I was throwing up more often. My mom wanted to take me on a trip for 2 weeks during spring break i accept and I dont smoke or juul at all. when I came back from the trip i was in my home town and could not get my hands on a juul, so I smoked a full joint by myself and did not cough once, i ended up smoking the rest of that day without a single cough. Then I get back to college the next day and I am able to hit my juul again and I start coughing again and throwing up. I drew the conclusion that for me personal juuling is killing my throat, I did not quit then.

Finally, Sorry if the formatting is weird, or my spelling is strange, or anything else that is kinda mess. I wrote this Concerta instead of studying.

Well, I was put on 5 mg of Abilify three times daily, Trazadone 20 mg at night  (9 pm) and Lexapro 10 mg, but I refused lexapro since I am bipolar and have schizoaffective disorder, but the psych ward gave it to me on my last day without telling me. Well, I am a daily user of weed, upon heavily smoking I started to hallucinate. I thought I had three tongues, everything was off, touching, seeing and thinking stuff was just so distorted and so intense like drinking water was so overwhelming I had to stop, my heart beat was so intense I felt it throughout my body.  I started seeing shit wavy, but no vividness with color saturation. Everything is so distorted and everything seems so off to me. I kept shifting and moving because I just can't stay still, it seems that nothing allows me to remain comfortable wherever I'm at. I also feel a bit euphoric but overall, anxiousness and nervousness which I know are symptoms of Abilify withdrawal, but has anyone experienced this with Abilify? No where I look does anything involve hallucinations/distortions with Abilify.

35389,Cocaine,Cocaine and chest pain,"Gonna keep this short and sweet, looking for some input on cocaine related to chest pain and heart issues:

&amp;#x200B;

I (21M) have been an avid user of drugs for a long time, first starting with weed at 13. I started smoking daily around 18 and eventually worked up to about an eighth daily. Nowadays, I only smoke a few times a week and only about .25-1 gram per day depending (granted it is usually around 18-25% dispo stuff).

&amp;#x200B;

Since my early teen years I would have moments where I noticed my heart would beat funny sometimes, and was always conscious of it but never got a diagnosis. At 19 I went to a doctor for a separate issue but asked him to listen to my heart to which he said he did hear a somewhat irregular heartbeat and I probably had a mild case of Mitral Valve Prolapse. At 20 I started being a lot healthier, exercising and cutting back on soda and junk food, trying to be productive etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I've been indulging in some cocaine which was tested at 93%. Not going into details, but I am confident in the fact that it is 93% pure. For a couple of days I did about 200mg per day, broken up in about four lines spread throughout the day. On the final day I only did a small bump about 40-50mg but after about 45 mins I felt some weird chest pain. It felt like a clenching in my chest near my left pectoral which made me think it was something going on with my heart. Now, it should be said I'm a cautious person when it comes to drugs, I rarely even do a ""full dose"" of whatever substance I am ingesting hence why I only do about 50mg of coke per line.

&amp;#x200B;

The clenching seemed to increase when I tried inhaling deeply. To be honest, I thought I might be having some sort of mild heart attack, but I am a decently healthy 21 year old (5'7"", 120lbs). After a while it subsided, but still sort of lingered for a few hours. Earlier that day, I did have about 12oz of a Monster Energy drink and took 2 pills of T-Up (a sort of testosterone booster, the main ingredient being D-Aspartic Acid 750mg each). My dad also has some sort of heart issues, has had some EKGs in his life as well as having his heart ""shocked"" 2-3 times but I always assumed this would not affect me too much.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, based on the information above, do you think it is safe for me to consume about 50mg-100mg of cocaine for even 1-2 days at a time? I am a bit of a hypochondriac so I think I tend to get a little more anxious about small issues within my body but I want to remain safe. Also I've read that the average overdose amount of cocaine is 1.2 grams but some people can even overdose on 30mg if they are hypersensitive.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: it should be noted that even with my ""heart issues"" I have never had problems exercising (was a XC runner in high school). Usually the irregular heart beat would come on randomly and I assumed it was a consequence of too much caffeine or unhealthy eating rather than the stress of physical activity.

&amp;#x200B;

35414,Psychedelics,Lsd and muscle flexing/spasms,"Hey guys. So I got a story to talk about. So a while ago I was doing some lsd with my friends. We all had 2 tabs. I dont know exactly how much acid was on the blotters but all ik is there were stronger than usual. Unlike most of my other trips it got to the point  were it became so intense I could barely tell what the things around me where. Like they were moving and molding so much that I couldnt understand what they were. Also I had what it looked like a screen made of geometric patterns over my vision. Crazy trip. 
 But the part of my trip I really dont understand is when my body started flexing up. At certian points when the trip would get really strong I wouldn't be able too move. I dont know if I was flexing when the trip became super Intense. But , every time I would stand up it would feel like my muscles were locked like half ways so I couldnt stand up without it hurting my  tendon connecting my upper and bottom leg. Also my calves were aching and it basically felt like my whole leg was cramping and I couldnt stretch it. It lasted till the day after the next day and it hasnt happened on any other psychedelic or really any other time ever. Any thoughts on what it could of been???",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/al65xf/lsd_and_muscle_flexingspasms/

35453,I :love: Drugs,Has anyone here ever heard of someone talking to people that weren’t there on MDMA?,"Hello all! So me and my girlfriend took some MDMA a couple nights ago. I’m 22 she’s 19. She weighs 130lbs and it was her first time taking it. I weigh 150lbs and I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve rolled. She took .1 to start and I took .2 to start. An hour later she wasn’t feeling it and took another .1 while I took another .2 because well... I wanted to roll harder :) about three hours after our initial dose we both took another .2 which means at the end of it all she took .4 and I took .6!

Not very proud of our doses. It wasn’t really good MDMA I usually don’t take more than 150mgs but that was when I had a fire sass connection now I’m just getting meh MDMA and it takes a lot more for me to get there.

Anyways near the end of the night she started talking to people that weren’t there. She was making no sense but some of it sounded like it had already happened in the past. Like she was recalling and reliving memories. She kept saying she was loosing touch with reality as well.

Has anyone heard of this before? Because I never have. Is she crazy? We were only on MDMA and weed.

35457,LSD,I tripped on acid and got naked in front of my parents,"This one night I decided I was going to trip on acid with my sister being my sitter. I was okay for the first few hours, everything was kind of overwhelming because I took a greater dose than I usually do, it was a dose of 200ug. My sister said she was too tired to watch me so she left after a few hours or so, which I really wish she hadn't done. I took the tab at 12 am, and by that time it was 2 am. So I decided I was just gonna chill, eat something, listen to music, and later masturbate. It was gonna be great, or so I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I got to eating something, which was way too much for me to handle, so I just put some music and was chilling until my mom came in my room. At this time it was about 3:30 am. I was SO high, I couldn't conceal that I was in front of my mom. She said ""give me your phone,"" I replied, ""no, I want to listen to music."" In hindsight, I should've complied and gave her my phone. She took my phone from my hand and went downstairs shaking her head. My DUMBASS followed her for some fucked reason. I said ""I want my phone, I just want to listen to music,"" and obviously you could see that I was under the influence of some drug so she asked ""what's wrong with you?? Why are you acting like that?"" And guess the FUCK what, I replied, ""I took a tab of acid."" And i proceeded to walk my high ass upstairs to my room. I don't remember her response. 

&amp;#x200B;

So then I just sat in my room tripping balls, and had the weirdest fucking trip I have ever had, but that's a story for another day. My mom has to get up for work at 4, so apparently she came into my room and I was buck naked. I barely remember what happened in real life, only what I experienced while on acid. My parents told me everything after the situation happened and was over with, which is the only reason I know what happened. I was naked, telling them to take their clothes off too. I think the reason I told them to take their clothes off was because I wanted to be ""one"" with them, no barriers. I guess that was my mentality on acid. And then I started screaming at the top of my lungs, like LOUD. I don't exactly remember why, I just wanted to be ""free"". Mind you, it was 4:30 am, everyone in the neighborhood was the FUCK asleep. But yeah, maybe I'll make another post describing my acid experience. It was...unexplainable. I'm pretty sure that acid was laced.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/al6l81/i_tripped_on_acid_and_got_naked_in_front_of_my/

35488,I :love: Drugs,"A doctor believes it's a good idea to regulate MDMA and make it OTC, what are your thoughts on this?","So I was watching the morning News, now I live in Australia, a doctor was just giving an interview where he claimed that regulating MDMA would make it a lot safer for people who use MDMA. I believe that this is one of the first steps to making drug use in general a lot safer, it doesn't make it safe, just safer. I believe that this should be the case for a lot of substances of abuse around the world at the moment, now Australia hasn't even approved pill testing at festivals, so this is a bit of a reach. But the beginning of harm reduction and safe use that society deserves &amp; needs.  

This outdated view of ""don't take drugs, they're a bad!"" Is clearly not working. Humans will continue to use drugs for as long as this earth spins. I would like to know what you thoughts on this are? 

Do you believe this will make things better or worse?

35625,Cannabis,Lets be real. Is weed a gateway drug and why/why not?,"The title really says it all. First mind altering substance I tried was cannabis. The thing is, based on my upbringing, my personality, and my environment I would have inevitably tried weed. Though based on circumstances I first smoked in 5th grade. I'm only 19 and have now tried 34 different substances. I would have tried many, regardless of trying weed.

At the same time, I have a friend whom's first substance before nicotine, alcohol, or weed was MDMA. 


I'll start off by stating my belief. I don't believe any substance is inherently a gateway drug. I think that with cannabis, the only reason it is a gateway drug is because you cross over the line from legal substances to illegal substances. If cannabis was a widely consumed legal substance, then it would fall into the same class as alcohol. A legal high. The sole reason why it may be considered a gateway drug is the fact that you are venturing from legal substances to something that feels foreign, unlawful and rebellious.

Do you guys believe that weed is a ""gateway drug.""

35713,I :love: Drugs,Vyvanse/Adderall What it's like mixing most common drugs with it (My Experience),"(If you don't know what a Vyvan is, it's like Adderall basically same effects overall expect Vyvanse are smoother than Adderall and is less powerful but overall same effects so when I did mix these drugs with my Vyvanse I would imagine you would get the same or very similar effects I was on Adderall)So I don't have ADHD and i take Vyvanse about 3x a week really helps me in college as I can write for hours on end without getting bored. I also do drugs mainly every weekend this consists of MDMA, Ketamine, Cocaine, Weed and lots of alcohol.(Not all at the same time I try and stick to one drug a night but I have done every combination of the drugs I've listed before and once I did them all in the space of one night except I wasn't on Vyvanse sorry getting off topic)

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: I do 40MG of Vyvanse and never dropped more than on a day been on them for nearly 2 months 3x a week however I am trying to slow down as I feel like I'm building up a tolerance**

&amp;#x200B;

**If you had a different experience to me on any of these drugs while on Adderall or Vyvanse let me know I'm curious (especially if you've done coke with them tell me your experience because that was maybe the best time of my life)**

&amp;#x200B;

So what's it like when you're on Vyvanse/Adderall and:

**Weed**: Amazing was talking a lot felt great the best way to describe this is being wide awake and aware but also really relaxed and comfortable, usually when I really awake I'm never really comfortable I guess because I have loads of energy but when I was baked I was awake and comfortable at the same time which made me really relaxed great feeling and i was talking load. However, I was not focused at all it was almost like weed took that side affect out the Vyvanse and you're left with all the other side effects so I felt really wide awake and would find myself drifting off when someone would speak to me. Getting to sleep was also a nice feature the weed gave me usually it I'm up till 3am/4am on a Vyvan but the weed put me to sleep around 12 m. Waking up was brutal I can usually wake up at a decent time maybe like 9pm 10pm the day after taking a Vyvan but fuck me did i feel tired it was like I had 1hr sleep, woke up at 12pm so i've had 12hrs sleep, I could have gone to sleep standing up if I wanted to

Being that awake and not being able to focus is a weird feeling but you're also so relaxed at the same time weird feeling  (I would recommend it tbh it's a nice feeling) Personally I'm not doing Weed and a Vyvan again it's a nice feeling but just being stoned on its own is better and the morning thing isn't worth it

&amp;#x200B;

**I want to put this out there before explaining the cocaine experience, how dangerous it fucking is to do this combo especially on Adderall as that is stronger than a Vyvanse you can very easily get a heart-attack from it and it fucks up your brain if you do it regularly I was 17 doing this if i was any older I would have deffienlty had a heart attack**  That being said...

&amp;#x200B;

**Cocaine:** FUCKING WOW OMG HAHA MAYBE BEST SHIT EVER by far top 5 of my drug experiences it's shit that this is so dangerous. When I first took a Vyvanse my first thought straight away was ""I need to try cocaine on this"" so that week I went to my friend's house with a gram of coke, I dropped my Vyvan 2hrs before I had bought 2 massive red bull cans. So I got to his necked a red bull had a cig, waited for 30min did a line probably about a .3 line, bang I was there the most energy I've ever had in my life, my jaw was gurning more than the time I had a gram of MD but I didn't care I was up for anything, If someone said lets go for a 10 Mile run I would have easily said yes. I felt like an MD steaming mood where you're just interested in everything and i was so focused and my mind was so clear. I went out for a cig finished that in like 30seconds no joke got back inside, ""right let's get another line"" did another .3 line fucked actually never felt so good in my life. I thought MD was the only drug that would ever get me that happy but I was wrong this combination I've never been so happy in my life. My heart was about to break through my chest, I swear. about 20min had passed since I did my second line so I thought fuck it opened another red bull necked that, finished bag off and from there everything was so fast, time was going so fast it's uncanny I would look at the time it's like 4:00pm look again after thinking it had been 3min now it's 4:10pm everything was so fast pace it's hard to explain. about 20min into the last line The thing is when you have the much energy  you start getting really agitated and I've never been so uncomfortable in my life I had nothing to do while having that much energy I wanted to run, but my heart was going so fast I was too scared to do any activity's that would make it go faster now it's been 40min into the line... comedown crash coke time:( I've never experienced something so shit in my life all my energy is gone... my happiness, didn't even know if that was ever coming back. I had a better come down off a gram of MD than this, fucking awful, looking back it was worth it words can't describe the feeling but I hope you kinda get an idea. Words really can't justify

One of the Best experience of my life comedown was shit but weed helped that so yeah

&amp;#x200B;

**Ketamine:** Weird, Weird, Weird man... I had about .6 in the space of 1.5hrs, ket on a Vyvan, my body was having a battle with my mind but you feel sober as fuck your body is tranquilized you wanna sit down and stuff but your mind is so sober while your body is fucked, can't walk straight at all which is a weird feeling when you are completely sober mentally. If you have ever done cocaine and ket it's like that but more mentally sober and less energy kind of. I had such a banging headache it was unreal but I felt freash as fuck the next day.

Being totally sober mentally and not being able to control your body is a mind fuck, it really is plus a banging headache... not nice wouldn't recommend

&amp;#x200B;

**MDMA:** This is short and simple. Pointless. took about .5 to start off with and can I just say You would need so much more MDMA than you normally do to feel normal effects of it. Don't get me wrong you've still got that wired feeling and stuff but you don't feel it near as much as you should be it's that sober feeling again of feeling wide awake. I dropped another .3 comeup hits... got me a little more wired again I would say I was soberer than wired easily. I was still feeling good, better than I feel on a Vyvan but not as much as I should have been

It was just a waste of money and a night, the best part was I didn't get a comedown because I wasn't even steaming so :D

&amp;#x200B;

**Drinking:** I wanted to write what it was like doing ket and MD before drinking similar experiencesSame thing with MD pointless need loads to get drunk as you still have a sober mind mentally. Sort of like ket you can see a difference with your body slightly, I had about 7 pints (That gets me wanked) but I felt nothing on my mind but more on my body more relaxed and comfortable and when i was walking just like the Ket but more fucked couldn't walk straight for shit and having that sober mind made it such a fucking mind fuck my head was actually banging it was shit. My head just didn't feel right, my body felt nice tho head was mashed.Some of you can relate to my head from this example basically when you started the sesh on a Thursday and you do drugs every day till Sunday then when you wake up Monday morning and your just so out of it and your head is just mashed to fuck, being drunk and on Adderall is exactly like that you're sober but just mashed to fuck and out of it while your body is chilling

This was so weird head was banging and super out while mentally sober it's a weird feeling man and my body was chilling full on shlump mode, do not recommend it was shit, woke up shit as well not nice

&amp;#x200B;

**I've just realized writing all of this:**

**IT'S ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RID OF THAT FEELING OF BEING MENTALLY SOBER AND WIDE AWAKE WHEN TAKING THESE DRUGS TOGETHER AND IS VERY EASY TO OVERDOSE FROM BECAUSE YOU FEEL SOBER PLEASE IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS TAKE REGULAR AMOUNT THAT YOU NORMALLY DO, IT'S TEMPTING TO TAKE MORE WHEN YOU MIX ADDERALL/VYVANSE WITH THE DRUGS I'VE DISCUSSED...

I started this job last week on Monday. Ever since then until now, I've been able to sleep 2-4 hours per night. I've slept that long per day since then. From the moment I wake up I do the following:

* I chain vape (3mg nicotine) for my nicotine addiction.

* I take my 70 mg Vyvanse medication for the day, so I can deal with my binge eating.

* To stay awake because I only slept 2-4 hours, I sip on a large coffee which has 3 creams and 3 sugars. I have one of these for the day, I sip on it throughout my working day.

* I don't eat anything throughout my day except for when it's night time which is around 1-2 am, I have a small amount of food and sleep.

* Then I wake up shortly after and do it all over again.

I'm able to stay on task efficiently and effectively this way. 

_____________________________________________________________________________

I need Vyvanse to control my binge eating disorder. The Vyvanse has helped me out a lot in the past couple of months, I'm down a lot of weight. This Vyvanse medication is causing me insomnia. To deal with the insomnia, I'm drinking coffee. The coffee is making me more alert which might be keeping me up at night as well. The nicotine is used as I used to smoke. Nicotine also causes insomnia. 

Three stimulants are being used all day, with 2-4 hours of sleep. All three stimulants are causing insomnia, I need all three to get my shit together in life.

Anyways, I started not feeling well recently.. But today, I noticed something weird.

My chest on my left side felt strange. There was a brief palpitation situation going on. I focused on my breathing, then it was gone.

I'm afraid of this happening again. I'm going to try to cut down on the coffee tomorrow morning.

35848,Cannabis,Unknown dose of lsd + weed = I saw God,"(long ass post, you can skip to the part I lit my blunt) 
okay storytime, this past weekend I went on a vacation with my buddy. I had seen a post here about snowboarding on acid and I just had to try. I had about two 155 ug (had bought 5 from trusted vendor and judging from the previous ones I took the dosage seemed on spot) tabs. Im saying about two because they were cut up to little pieces from the most recent trip I had. Basically I had the leftovers from two tabs my friend wanted to divide into 5 pieces each because he was too afraid to take the full dose. 

I tried to explain to him that cutting up tabs does not ensure that you get the exact dosage you hope for. In other words, two pieces the same size could have a 50 ug difference of dose in them. He still wanted to trip without the full dose so I said wtf, lets do it. We ended up taking 2 pieces of one separate tab for each (I didnt want to do my whole tab while this guy took 2/5 of his; it just didnt feel right). Plus in the end I left with all the leftovers; meaning his too lol.

So fast forward, I had a total of 6 pieces of those leftover tabs which could be at most 200 ug. Took two pieces and started having a blast. My god people, if youre into snowboarding and have a buddy willing to tripsit you and guide you to the different lifts for the different trails, you have to try it. Just make sure to dress tight, bust on those headphones, and feel the wind against your soul. I noticed that I had less visuals while boarding, but once we took a break I could tell how hard I was tripping. After all the white snow just going inside and seeing all the colors sort of overwhelmed me lol. I was glad to have my friend and kept my cool so it was a blast. My first 7-8 hours of the trip was basically snowboarding lol


LIGHTING THE BLUNT
The darker side of my trip came when we got into the car. I was at the 9 hour mark after redosing the second piece so it was time to smoke some weed for me. Here I should note that I was a pretty regular weed smoker until I quit for a long tolerance break of over a month. Once I smoked half the blunt my entire world became a darkass minecraft type game. It was dark and we had a 4 hour drive ahead of us. My car (my friend was driving of course) felt like a fucking spaceship with all its buttons and lights. As the music changed so did the interior design. For some reason, I started thinking about a bunch of knowledge I learned about science, religion, and social behavior in general. 

Skipping all the mixed up details, I saw all the people in the world but without faces; just mannequins with small blue flames centered in their head. As they interacted with each other, their flames would grow or shrink. I noticed when a person hurt someone their flame would shrink and go to the person they hurt, making their flame larger. But it would shrink from the weirdest things like someone just saying something as a joke or making a comment about someone else behind their back. Its like something was watching over all of us and distributing the flames among mankind.

 I also saw how this distribution was in the past; there was much less interaction. I understood from the present that the flames were flying back and forth. Musicians rapping about drugs, guns, killing, and stealing were shrinking like crazy (i think my friend was listening to some 6ix9ine or something lol) while politicians were basically giving out flames to millions. It was scary how one online video could influence so many people or how technology has enabled us to fuck each other up from such far distances (as well as being used for good of course)

Idk exactly how to interpet what I saw for myself but it was scary. I saw how my flames were shrinking and all of a sudden a huge white light erupted from the sky. Everybodys flames were growing brighter and brighter with the sky. Then we all turned into something i cant explain but it was fucking beautiful. The flames within everyone were burning bright af in harmony and perfect synchronization with the entity in the sky. It felt so good, like it was something we were meant for ever since birth. 

But then something horrible happened, some flames were being extinguished. They were too small and just died . As my flame started to flicker,  I watched in horror as i fell out of synch along with others- all the bad people who fucked up. At this point my friend had pulled up at the gas station and said he was going to grab some honey buns. I was silent and still throughout this dreamlike part of the trip but just his talking brought me back to reality. I was still in the intense headspace and was convinced that I saw god for the next hour or so. 

What I understood from this trip was that i definately dont think that we will stop existing. Just as the universe is balanced in nature, I think everything done in this world will be balanced in the end. Even if there wasnt a heaven/hell, i think that when I die, if I look back at my life and feel unsatisfied or regret most of my actions, and if my conscience does not die with my body, im going to make myself pay. Maybe our consciences is a form of  dark matter or energy and hell is just an eternal bad trip we give ourselves once our egos are gone with our death.

Anyway, i thought id share lol. For the record, with a tolerance i used to smoke weed at the peak lf my acid trips but this was a whole different level. Now I know the diff between smoking weed on acid with and without a tolerance; gotta say I like with tolerance much much more lol.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ala5cu/unknown_dose_of_lsd_weed_i_saw_god/

35903,GABAergics,Why isn't Pregabalin / Lyrica talked about more?,"Real talk here.

Started using Pregabalin / Lyrica over a year ago for my chronic pain and it utterly changed my life in ways I could not have imagined.

It was the only medication that took my pain away and increased my sociability - I thought it made me feel what others always felt: normal

When you give a man a pill that can take away all of his problems and your doctor tells you that ""it's fine, take as many as you want!"" then the answer becomes quite obvious. One year later and I'm at nearly 900mg a day. I don't even really get ""high"" off of it anymore, I just need it for maintenance. I also started mixing it with Modafinil. 'Ho boy. As someone with Bipolar, this is not the best cocktail.

I've had relationship issues, financial issues, struggles with maintaining friendships, horrific withdrawals, employment issues and even legal issues. Yet I still would rather it over the alternative. I don't care if I turn into a degenerate; I can function on it as a normal person to a degree, yet I'd much rather be a spontaneous, unreliable oddball than a quiet, timid person in emotional and physical pain constantly. 

This is my new ""normal"" - I shouldn't have to rely on a substance to keep me functioning, yet I have to. It's unfortunate. As my tolerance continues to rise, I know that I will slowly become more and more like my old self and rely on this medication purely just to avoid the withdrawals. I've tried numerous times to get back down to a regular dose, yet I just can't. Soon enough my doctor will realise something's up due to my increasingly frequent script requests. This isn't gonna get any better. 

Can anybody else relate at all?

&amp;#x200B;

I can see this [https://imgur.com/a/a5o1VAh](https://imgur.com/a/a5o1VAh)   gta san andreas menu screen in different variations, it can change shapes, it might not even be made from text, just from random things, but the shapes are always arranged, like in the text in gta SA pause screen. And characters from ""Fosters home for imaginary friends"", are always involved in some weird way. The loop goes something like this:  I try to ""select"" the longest line (""star new game""), which is really hard, so I miss everytime,   and everything goes black, so my mind realizes that I was playing this stupid ""minigame"" loop again, and I try to break out from it -  I can't, and my mind always says this one fucking sentence: ""Mēs nevaram ietekmēt mūsu domas, domas valda pār mūsu prātu"", which translates to something like ""We cant change our thoughts, out thoughts rule over our consciousness "". It always makes perfect sense at that moment, that the level at which we are thinking, is almost useless , and our unconsciousness does all the actual thinking, that make our decisions.

p.s Last time I have watched  ""Fosters home for imaginary friends"", I was 6 years old and I'm 17 now, and I haven't played  GTA SA for about 2 years, but it was a huge part of my childhood.

36110,Cannabinoids,Did I have a panic attack?,"TLDR: got super stoned after a t break and thought I was being paralysed, felt VERY real.


So I’ve been on a t break for 4 days and my mate sold me 3g for $20 so I thought fuck it let’s get real stoned. I haven’t been in a spot where I got to bakes in ages so I packed my cone piece full the top with unspun bud (I usually spin but no cigs rip) and scraped ALOT of dusties on it as well.

So I pulled it and of course got really baked then I started scratching my lower back and noticed it felt numb, but I could still feel my hand touching in, idk how else to describe it. See I have had back problems for a while, shit like I’ll wake up and my lower back will be in pain and I struggle to get comfy when sleeping, nothing major. So this started a very intense few hours of me thinking my backs going numb and I’m going to die or be paralysed and my heart starting beating faster and faster then I was trembling heaps, all over my body but mainly my legs which worsened the I’m being paralysed thoughts and this went on for a while, at one point I almost burst into tears because I had no idea what the fuck was happening. 

It didn’t just feel numb but when something touched my back it would feel weird as fuck and uncomfortable, I should probably mention I was at the stage of stoned where you get very intense waves of feeling through your body, at some points when I shut my eyes it felt like I was falling. 

My girlfriend was with me the whole time and was convinced it was a panic attack.
Honestly one of the most scary few hours of my life, I hate that feeling of not knowing if I’m about to die or if something is seriously wrong.
I didn’t call an ambulance because I still had the thought that I’m literally the baked guy that goes to the hospital n says he’s dying from a panic attack

Anyone had anything similar?

36128,Cannabis,"Have quit weed for 6 months bc of anxiety, kinda want it back","Started smoking weed about 3-4 years ago. All was fine and well at first (maybe more than well, i was very prone to mildly tripping by it, in a very enjoyable way as well) soon i upped my usage to the point where i was smoking at least every other day or so. The constant ""improved"" introspection and mindset that it gave me was very interesting and enjoyable at first, didn't think much of it until my new school year started and that's where it kinda goes downhill for some reason. I started getting the usual extreme self-consciousness, overthinking and social anxiety gradually (on top of that the way it affected my vision started bothering me for some reason). The fact that those symptoms coincided with the beggining of my new school year may have to do with the fact that most of my friends changed schools and i only had my girlfriend with me. I got along with most people and didn't face rejection of any sort but i started losing the ""connection"" i naturally felt with people and gradually felt like i was turning in to myself/my head.

&amp;#x200B;

The last part is mainly the one that bothered and still kinda bothers me to this day, whenever i saw my friends i felt like i had less and less to talk about and that they are DEFINITELY noticing that (which they didn't until i talked to them about it). It felt like my personality was getting diminished day by day. My mood and general mental state at that point was shit, i smoked every night before i slept which in combination to a generally shitty sleep schedule made me fluctuate between feeling depressed and/or very irritable the next morning. Laziness was also through the roof which evidently affected my performance in school.

My first attempt at tackling those symptoms was only smoking alone / with close friends. Didn't really work, i mean, i didn't have the feeling that ""eyes were all over me"" that you may have when smoking at school or being high outside but in the case of being at home i felt that SOMETHING was looking at me from my window in combination with this irritating dizziness/vision i mentioned above and in the case of only smoking with close friends i didn't see any improvements in the social anxiety/negative self-perception aspect.

Second attempt, tried to get a tolerance break, lasted about a month. Didn't really work either, symptoms were more or less the same.

Until the point when i realized it's just probably not gonna get better if my general mental state didn't. It wasn't doing me any good and it wasn't enjoyable in the slightest anymore. Started and still currently working on things like responsibility, self-esteem, anxiety (therapy has been doing miracles in those aspects) and being able to feel good being sober. As mentioned in the title, i've been on this break for about half a year and my mental state has definitely improved, the ""brain fog"" has mostly been cleared (not always caused by weed), responsibility and school performance have also improved dramatically. Social anxiety, overthinking and self-esteem issues have gotten better but are still bothering me which has made me come to the conclusion that they are definitely not caused by marijuana use.

Coming to the main issue, i tried to see if it has the same effects on me some weeks ago by taking a few tokes and it mainly did, sadly. I definitely don't want to go back to the hell that was daily smoking but i wanna be able to enjoy a joint every once in a while. ""Trying a different strain"" isn't really helpful bc THC-domintant strains are still illegal in my country, though last year medical marijuana got legalised and some high CBD (15-22%) low-THC (&gt;0.2%) products have been popping up and am thinking of trying them. However what i truly want to experience again is the ""magic"" or just sharing a joint and having a good time, which is pretty much exclusively caused by the THC as far as i know. As i said, being illegal, street THC-dominant strains don't effect me all that well and i've tried a ton (So the ""muh laced"" arguement isn't really valid). I wouldn't be crushed if it ain't possible to ever experience weed in a good manner again but i'm curious and a tiny bit craving it at times.

36182,Stimulants,I don’t Think vyvanse is working?,"My doctor recently upped my vyvanse dosage from 30mg to 50 mg. I have been on adderall, Ritalin in the past and tbh I don’t notice too much when I take it. 

Adderall gave me this energy, but often it would make me dizzy and feel weird. I took XR, and because of it I never slept and then I switched to IR, and got up to 30 mg of it. After a year on it, i then started to get awful side effects and switched to Ritalin IR, which didn’t work and now Vyvanse. 
It has been two days since taking Vyvanse and I’m still a little lethargic at times, and low energy. Yesterday I spend all day in my bed playing video games and I was so focused on it. 

I also recently started birth control, the mini pill. So idk if that could be playing into it too. 

My doctor gave me a trial for a week to see how I like it luckily, but I’m not sure what to do. I have some left over 10 mg Ritalin (hated Ritalin) which I took with it today. I’m just a bit concerned that if I go up a dose of vyvanse my mood will swing, which is why I went off adderall xr. I had a few depressive episodes the past two days.

36191,Dextroamphetamine,Adderall XR (crushed up) vs Dexedrine IR question,"So I sometimes have 5mg Dex IR which is great for crushing up to snort or boof or under tongue etc. 5mg seems small but it I find it to be relatively strong. Then, with adderall XR, if I crush up the little beads, it should be relatively similar right? From what I understand Adderall is made up of dex as well as some other amphet salt.


However, I notice that the adderall seems weaker, and maybe less euphoric in similar amounts. Is this just because Dex is more euphoric/powerful so adderall (which is less than 100% Dex) will normally not be that great? Or perhaps it is hard to really crush those little beads well and that is where my issue is? OR I'm just an idiot and the difference is in my head?

36208,Psychedelics,4mg 25C-NBOH Report,"I took two tabs of 25c-nboh dosed at 2mg each. I really do like this chem and I feel it is very underappreciated. I lost all track of time for most of this trip, so I cannot timestamp anything. I knew that it was going to be intense around 20 mins after dosing, I noticed effects similar to coming down on 2mg. I thought this was crazy, because normally I just slowly drift into a trip. 

The first thing I notice is that my curtain has a geometric pattern with a rainbow aura surrounding it. The best way I can describe the curtain shapes would be like the platforms from Qbert but sort of slanted. This is normally a black and white curtain so the color really interested me. I then looked at my cat and I just felt it was some sort of angelic being. I could see each hair with a white glow to them, and  could see in between them all at the same time. At this point most of my focus was drawn to the cat. I tried to put on some music, but I did not like it too much. I was already experiencing severe auditory hallucinations. I remember describing them as being able to hear everything dripping, but I have no idea how to put into words what I was hearing. I was also hearing sounds and beeps from every direction with no rhythm or anything, all sound would slow and stop and then suddenly speed up out of nowhere and this made me a little afraid. After looking at the cat for what must have been at least 40 mins, I grabbed it by the paw I suppose for comfort and then looked at my brick wall. The cat flipped over and I did too, and I started to push the wall. At this point the trip was getting very intense, I was pushing the wall and in my mind it was moving slightly. I felt like I was moving the wall backwards. After this I realized through my delusions that this was unprovoked and I should not be pushing my wall. So I closed my eyes and I saw some of the most complex shapes I have ever seen. I would look at them and after a few minutes they would begin to add another sort of dimension to themselves. It went from flat to 3d, then it twisted in every direction and zoomed out. It would keep zooming out but stay the same size for the rest of the time I had my eyes closed. I opened my eyes again and began to obsess with the cat, I was trying to make it comfortable so it would not leave my bed. I then remembered that porn existed and that it was something people enjoyed. I began to look through different clips and become immersed into different strange worlds of porn, but the weirdest part was that I did not understand why this was something special. To me it felt like a TV show or something. I kept asking myself the same question, why. I suddenly became very afraid after picturing something that was creepy. Once again I reverted to worshiping the cat and holding its paw. Eventually I drifted to YouTube where I found one creator to be very calming and proceeded to watch his entire channel until the trip was over. I believe it was Danny Gonzalez. At some point I really had to take a piss but was not too keen on standing and disturbing the cat. I did it anyway and the cat left which made me a bit sad. At around seven hours after dosing I managed to sleep if you could call it that. It felt like I was just laying with my eyes closed but I am sure I lost consciousness at some point. I woke up an hour later still experiencing auditory hallucinations and this stuck around for another hour after that. I still do not feel back to baseline as I write this, I am having trouble communicating with people still.

This is the first of my 25c-nboh trip reports. I have taken a dose of 4mg in the past before but it is not shared here yet. I would like to share all of my experiences with this chemical from now on because I ordered a large amount recently and I feel it is not a very well liked chem.

36213,Antidepressants,Sertraline withdrawal?,"I've started tapering myself off sertraline (150mg/day for the last 5 years). I went from 150 to 100, and it's only been 4 days and I'm miserable. I feel like crying every like 5 minutes for no reason. Like my eyes are just watery all the time and I just want to curl up in a ball and never come out. I also have had a very small appetite, which is weird for me because I love food (and work in the food industry). I was never considered depressed, but was more being treated for severe anxiety, OCD and PTSD (I was on propranolol for a couple years but stopped that cold turkey.. about 6 months ago). I want to be SSRI free, as it's just not sustainable for me to be taking sertraline for the rest of my life from a monetary standpoint and I really want to ""be ok"" without SSRI's. I've been going to the gym often which seems to help a bit. 

Has anyone else experienced discontinuation syndrome? I am finding so many things on google but would prefer to hear from people who have first-hand experience with sertraline specifically or something comparable. I feel like I'm going to scare my partner if I become a lethargic blob suddenly, but that's kind of where I'm at. Also having a hard time focusing on work, which is strange because normally I'm kind of obsessive and hyper-focused on work. Feeling a weird rollercoaster of feeling frantic and high-energy and then lethargic and unmotivated.

So I planned to just take a bit of bullshit for me to eat like cup noodles, lollies just all the healthy shit yeah. I'd also planned to try to sleep as much as possible of the flight to save me from my cuisine of instant noodles and protein bars. I asked old mate xanman for some help, copped a few 2mg bars the night before and planned to take half when I wake up and another whole before customs. With a heavy meal in me xanman suould be late and then itll hit me as we are waiting for the flight or someshit idk. 



So we get to the airport, half a bar deep already and we are waiting to check the bags in. There was some issue with dual citizens so immigration person had to come sort someshit out. Got sick of waiting so popped the other bar and continued waiting. This is where things started to get very hazy very quickly. I vaguely remember something about 100 dollars and 80 dollars and someone asking for my driver's license.

Xan man came early. 8 hours into the flight I ""wake up"", I have none of my food, a box of 5 cigars, a packet of sudafed and a bottle of mouthwash. Non of which I brought with me. 

How I got through customs without looking like a fucking bartard baffles me. And it baffles me even more that my dad that I'm travelling with didn't suspect a thing.

36351,Opioids,Describing heroin withdrawal the best i can,"For those who are curious. 

I always used to wonder what it felt like long before touching it, but now that im deep in it for the 3rd time its all too familiar and even just annoying at times. 

Fucking heroin is awesome when the ball starts rolling. Its so damn relaxing that its on your mind all the time. So the hell with it, you just start smoking black everyday ( or whatever youre doing). For days and weeks nothing unusual happens. Its almost like weed, you just comedown, sorta bummed that its over and thats that, do some more tomorrow. After a while the tone of it changes so slightly its like you cant quite put your finger on it. Am i just a little depressed today? Am i coming down with a cold? Did i sleep funny? This might go on a few more days and it creeps up so slowly you almost forget that youre starting to feel shitty when youre sober. You start feeling like you have a little flu now and the high of the heroin feels so good that it might not even dawn on you right away that you feel better when you get high. It just feels good anyways right?
Youve been sick with the cold or flu before but now you know somethings up. This isnt the flu. This is something youve never felt before and its getting unnerving now. ""Ah fuck, i got hooked on it"". Theres a whole way to it, theres rules to this shit. When the dope wears off youre not so much bummed that youre sober anymore, youre nervous of whats coming if you dont get some more. At first youre overall good if you have at one good dose in a given day. The day after you start getting butterflies in your stomach like something bad is about to happen but for the most part youre not sick yet. That following night the insomnia sets in and makes trying to sleep on stimulants sound easy. Its this fucking goddamn annoying thing in your back, like you need to stretch or pop your back but you cant if you try. Youre half asleep and tired as hell but you just cant slip into sleep. Now its the next day, your queasy, you feel like youre gonna have diarhea, your stomach feels empty and hollow but you dont have the slightest appetite. Sleep deprivation is setting in and you have this odd dizzy out of it sensation. Cognition is going out the window. You keep the process going and get your fix when you can but everything is starting to fall apart. The window of time between your last dose and the dopesickness is getting smaller and smaller. Eventually your feeling sick 12 hours after the last fix. And then its less than 10 hours, and thats when heroins character really comes out to play. You only get a full sleep if you get fixed up before you lay down. Youre waking up, your sweaty, but cold. Your nose runs, motivation hasnt come around in forever and you wanna make an excuse to get out of anything. Jobs start going down the tubes, ""sick"" days are piling up. Youre in a bathroom every 30 minutes with the most relentless diarhea until your asshole is raw flesh. Youre always tryna puke something up from your cold empty stomach. You are consumed with the most overwhelming anxiety, and you fidget and twitch cause you cant relax at all. You bounce your leg, your back fucking hurts like wtf is this? Theres some ache that comes from out of your bones it seems. All your muscles feel like you did an extreme workout yesterday. Moving around too much makes you dizzy. Depression is just always hanging out with you. This is an expensive habit and all your financial wisdom goes out the window if you even had any that is. Youll take out loans, fronts, skip bills, fall behind, pull fraud, tell lies, maybe even steal. Whatever it takes to get better. 
Its a long dark tunnel, could last 4 days or more before you start seeing light at the end, and thats a long time to be in there. Could be weeks before you start going back to normal, maybe longer.

Just for context, I have used Xanax in the past (6 months + ago) without withdrawal symptoms, but recently did some stupid shit and drank a fuckton on what I think is 1.0-1.25 mg this Saturday (had been doing QB-half bar w/ alcohol previous nights). I also smoked a fuckton of cigarettes then (no memory ofc) and so my stomach has been completely destroyed (constant Xanax hiccups, coming and going every 2-3 hours or so).

I did .25mg the Sunday after, so that puts me at 3 days since a QB. I'm constantly sniffling, have a nasty cough, insomnia (can't sleep without melatonin), and these god awful hiccups which are pretty much just fast sphincter spasms. I just took some Kratom to help me feel better and it definitely helps with the chills and anxiety. I have used a bunch of Kratom in the past as well without withdrawal, albeit not to help with Xanax withdrawals because I literally haven't ever gotten withdrawals with Xanax before.

Pills are confirmed and tested to be Xanax btw.

So, this being said, should I still taper? It's been 3 days since I last used, and I read that peak withdrawal is between days 3-6. Or, am I not really at any risk without tapering, since 1.25 mg with/ 5-6 drinks is the maximum I did since Saturday? God I swear I never want to do this shit again, and really wanna throw away what few pills I have left, but would like any help with drafting a tapering plan. I know tapering should be done with a physician, but it's only a week of doses &lt;=1mg. I am aware that there is risk of seizure, but apparently most of the cases where that happens is on 1+ mg for more than a month every day.

Any help would be much appreciated,

36609,Cannabinoids,Good potential synergy between weed and caffeine,"This is a tentative theory cause I haven't done much research yet, but it makes sense to me, so hear me out.  The idea is that marijuana makes your brain release dopamine, and caffeine is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.  Therefore, if you took a mid-high dose of caffeine (100-200 mg) and then smoked weed, your brain would be holding in lots of dopamine, so you would get really high, even if it didn't last long.  Also, this might work better with tea rather than pure caffeine, since tea contains caffeine, but in addition it also contains theobromine, theophylline, l-theanine, and flavanols, which all have psychoactive properties.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/aljtx0/good_potential_synergy_between_weed_and_caffeine/

&amp;#x200B;

Also, during both of these stories I was completely by myself, I didn't have a friend with me to tell me it may or may not have been a bad idea.  

&amp;#x200B;

DISCLAIMER: this does involve drinking and driving! so leave your triggered feelings at the door! I'm aware of how stupid it was and I've already gotten arrested for it and have payed my fines. Also, during this time period I was pretty fucked in the head and my mental health was not doing so well, I did not care about myself/hated myself and was suicidal and made an attempt on my own life at one point, I am much better now, for the most part. Just to give insight on my mindset/poor decision making skills during this time period, now that that's out of the way, lets begin.

&amp;#x200B;

Part 1.

&amp;#x200B;

M=sketchy crackhead lookin guy 

N=crackhead guys neighbor

O=me

&amp;#x200B;

So I regularly went to this really grungy dive bar/venue about one hour away from me almost every week for hardcore punk shows/metal shows, and when I say grungy I mean like graffiti all over the bathrooms, loose toilet seats with a screw missing and beers were $2-$3 sometimes $1! and re-entry was allowed, so you could go to your car to drink beer that you brought/do some lines or whatever the fuck you wanted. Anyways, after the show was over these two sketchy crackhead lookin guys come up to me asking for a ride home, they said they lived real close so I figured whatever I'll give them a lift home real quick and head home afterwards (I'm already drunk at this point and had some beers left in my car) so I end up giving them a lift home, one guy gets picked up by his girlfriend (or wife maybe? I thought it was his wife because he got picked up in a minivan) anyways, after he got picked up it was just me and the even more sketchy lookin guy. He invited me in to chill and finish the last few beers I had in my car, I said sure why not? So we head inside and the guy puts on some old GG Alan video, and tells me that it's his friend performing. A few minutes later his neighbor opens the door, she's really fucking drunk from some bar or club nearby, she sits down with us and not even within five minutes she shoves her hand right down my fuckin pants and grabs my dick, and her other hand is going up my shirt. M says ""I think I better leave you guys alone"" and he walks out of the room. So me and her start some foreplay for a bit and before we \*really\* get into things I check what time it is. It's fuckin 3:30 in the morning! I had work at 10 AM at this pizza delivery shop I was currently working at plus a one hour drive home. So right in the middle of everything I got my drunk ass up pulled my pants up and said I had to go. ""But O! where are you going!?"" ""I have to go to work in the morning!"" I said. So I buckled my belt, and headed out to my car. I start my car and look back at the building and she's just standing there with no pants or underwear on right in the doorway, ""but O come back! where are you  going!?"" I didn't say anything and just headed for the highway. So, I'm on the highway and about twenty mins into my drive I'm having trouble staying awake, and ten mins later I fall asleep at the wheel I side swipe a jersey barrier and it wakes me right the fuck up. I pull over to check the damage, luckily it was not anything major, it was only a scratch, I then decide to take a half hour nap on the side of the highway, and I surprisingly did not wake up to a state trooper knocking on my window. I then got home safely and managed to spend at least a few hours in my own bed.

&amp;#x200B;

So the next day!

&amp;#x200B;

Part two. The five hour pack of cigarettes run, on acid.

&amp;#x200B;

I go to work hungover (which was normal for me during this time) and work 10-7. I get out, stop home to change/shower and start heading to my friends apartment (who lives in the ghetto) I stop at a package store on the way there to grab a 12 pack (because that's just what I did every day after work during that time). I get to his place and his roommate and two other people are sitting down all zoned out, I ask my friend what is up with them, he says they're just coming down from an acid trip, my eyes light up. I asked if they had anymore and one of the guys (who I knew a bit from other parties) says for \*you\*? $5 a tab! I instantly bought two. So I take these tabs and start drinkin my 12 pack once the acid hit I spent the next few hours outside on their second story deck/porch bumming cigarettes from whoever came outside. I eventually got tired/felt bad for taking cigarettes from people so I decided to take a ride around the corner for pack of my own. I told them I'd be right back... (this is around midnight or so) I get to the store (It's one of those places where you can't actually go in but you just tell the clerk what you want and he puts it through the window) and there are these three real sketchy looking Hispanic guys with tattoos all the way up to their neck and some on their face, I get out to get my pack, and then one of them asked me if I could give them all a lift home (I already had trouble saying ""no"" to begin with) so I said ""yeah! come on in! where you guys headed?"" the where in the same area but on the much worse side of it. So I bring them to their destination and they asked if I wanted to smoke with them, I figured what the hell why not? So we smoke and talk for a bit. \*Then\* one of them asked if I want to come inside (again, I have trouble saying ""no"" and I'm already all fucked up on acid/booze/weed) so I said ""yeah sure"" they start talking it over in spanish, I could barely understand a word they are saying and start getting paranoid. They finally come to an agreement (whatever that was) and we start heading to their room. Me, being all fucked up started to thing that they're going to rob me so I tell them, i have to go and my friend is about to lock up his place (which was bullshit of course) they then told me that when they were all speaking Spanish a few minutes ago they were discussing if they should let me into their place or not and if they should trust me. After that, they convinced me to go into their place. About 10-20 minutes pass while I'm inside their place, we're just smoking weed and talking. Then one guy breaks out a big bag of cocaine! We all start doing lines, one guy starts cooking up plantains while another guy fires up the Xbox to play COD (I think it was black ops 1 or something around that era) so we start playing video games, eating food and doing lines, it was a great time. 5AM rolls around and one other guy asks if he could get a back to his place and I could head back to my friends apartment after that. (I guess he didn't live with the other two), he said it wasn't far, so he told me to drop him off at a nearby gas station which has some apartments behind it. He then hands me a free bag of coke, it wasn't much, but hey, free coke is free coke! ""what's this for?"" I said, ""hey man, you help me out, I help you out!...I gotta get home and get my daughter ready for school"" my jaw dropped when he said that. I then make my way back to my friends apartment hoping the doors aren't locked, thank fuck that they weren't! I find my friends roommate passed out on the couch and my friend was passed out drunk in his room. I go to my normal spot to get ready for bed, I do that bit of coke, play some counter strike, and then head to bed. The next morning rolls around (or later that day I guess) and I see my hungover friend walk across the hall, I stop him and say ""Yo, you are NEVER going to believe what happened last night!""

We get home for my mon to tell me cause my dad couldn't keep it together, she didn't have much to say other that when she went to check on her she was slumped  over and seemed to be in the middle of painting her toes.

The only thing I could think of was the fact she got prescribed valium to help get her off booze but her problem wasn't far enough gone to require that. Police said the script was taking as prescribed and we do know she slipped in a drink but who knows if she continued to.

Now I'm a fent, meth, crack, coke, anything in a needle addict and everyone thought it was me who died. The cop who heard the call even told my mom he thought he was there for me.

36846,Hydrocodone,Dentist appt tomorrow for crown filling-how to get vicodin,"Hi all, 

I had 2 root canal procedures earlier this month for one troublesome tooth. Each time I got a vicodin script. (even though I was in legit pain, it wasn't THAT bad and I could have just taken ibuprofen, but i didn't bc vicodin is awesome) Now I'm going to the dentist tomorrow to get a permanent filling put on the tooth (the root canal just put on a temporary filling). The root canal doctor specializes in root canals so it seemed standard to get the vicodin script from him, but I am unsure about the dentist tomorrow because it is a family dentist place, and this is a filling and not the ""dreaded root canal"" (even though it is the same troublesome tooth). 

My plan is to tell the dentist something like ""My tooth has been operated on 3x this last month and every time I have been in pain afterwards and its been hard to sleep, my tooth is always really sore afterwards, etc.""

Any tips/suggestions?

36905,Stimulants,Tips for lowering my Amphetamine tolerance?,"NOTE: I am a 19 y/o guy, 5’10, 180 lbs (if this info is important for some reason, lol)
I was prescribed Adderall XR 15 Mg during March of ‘18 for ADHD. I had gotten it multiple times from friends before that but I would usually take 2 of my caps on days before I had school. On days I had work i would either take one or not any at all. So pretty much daily usage. It worked pretty fine for me but around the time I started college in August, I noticed that it was not really helping me focus as well, and it was making me more jittery and anxious if anything. I was switched to Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine) in September (10 mg at first, now at 15 mg) and it feels “smoother” than adderall, that’s for sure. However, it took even quicker for the positive benefits of the Dexies to fade away. Now I’m at a bit of a crossroads. As I’m typing this, I’ve taken around 8 of my capsules over the course of the last 18 or so hours, and it’s not the same as it used to be. My question for the community is: what are some tips, vitamins, anything to help reset my tolerance to amps. They were so helpful for me and I want that feeling back.

36940,GABAergics,Klonopin vs Phenibut,"So, I suffer from a range of disorders. PTSD, OCD, BPD, agoraphobia, panic attacks, social anxiety, insomnia, and generalized anxiety. My SO also suffers from PTSD from Afghanistan. He’s tried Klonopin, Ativan, Xanax, none of them seem to help him, they just knock him out. He also has Crohn’s, and most people with Crohn’s also have terrible anxiety, and that anxiety makes their Crohn’s symptoms worse. He takes kratom for his pain, which has actually helped him get a much better quality of life, as far as pain goes, but he still has a really hard time. He receives a small compensation from the military because of the PTSD and he’s about to apply for disability for the first time. 

I used to hide indoors, I was terrified if my phone rang, I’d get this odd electric shock feeling in my hands and feet if I was started. My life was a mess. I couldn’t keep a job, I couldn’t sleep unless I was drunk, I couldn’t make eye contact— you know the drill. My SO also struggles, random panic attacks out of nowhere, struggles maintaining a job because of the anxiety and Crohn’s pain. 

My Klonopin has helped *a lot* along with my other medications but, with that help, after so many years, it may be taking its toll on my body and mind. I’m almost ok with it, though. As long as I don’t have such a poor quality of life like I used to.

I’m definitely experiencing a lot of short term memory loss. I’ll often go to tell my SO something, and he’ll have to remind me that I’ve already told him, numerous times, without having any recollection of the discussion. My tolerance has also built up, I get no high from my prescription, but did when I first received it. Because of the tolerance, my anxiety is coming back, but my doctor doesn’t want to up my dose any further. 

I keep hearing about Phenibut, and it’s pros and cons. One pro being it’s anxiety relief without effecting motor skills, relaxing effect, improves memory, helps you sleep etc.

36943,Psychedelics,CRAZY LSD + Weed + Nitrous Ego Death Experience,"I consumed approximately 250ug (2.5 tabs) of potent, tested LSD. Then I smoked a bowl of weed. At this point, everything already was very intense as you can imagine, but I decided to take it a step further.

I readied up a song on my phone (which was connected to really good headphones), filled a balloon with (just) one canister of nitrous oxide, and planned on playing the music, inhaling the balloon, flipping my phone over so it wouldn't brighten up my room, and closing my eyes while putting my head in my pillow to get the maximum potential for closed-eye visuals (my main goal).

I inhaled the balloon, and within 10 seconds my whole field of vision was obstructed with three dimensional visuals pulsating in every direction, equivalent to closed-eye visuals I get. My eyes were *still* open. And I quickly lost awareness of any reality or consciousness that ever existed for about 10 - 15 seconds, staring off into space while the visuals continued to blind me. 

It happened so quickly that I wasn't even able to flip my phone over, close my eyes, or even put my head in my pillow. 

I eventually began to regain my awareness of the world around me and my existence, and asked myself what the fuck just happened about six or seven times. My vision was still completely obstructed with the visuals for a few seconds after I started to regain awareness.

It was also my first experience with a true phycaedelic and i figured if it wasnt enough i could take bong tokes to get where i was trying to get.

Oh my god was it the greatest experience of my life. I was with my life long best friend chilling in his basement and it was actually the greatest drug experience of my life. Ive tried basically everything besides phycaedelics because ive been scared of trying them do to my depression. I didnt want to have a sad/bad trip.

Shrooms truly are a teacher. At the peak of my trip i had this voice in my head telling me all my faults and what i should do to make myself happier. I wrote 5 whole pages about my emotions while crying and then as soon as i was done writing that i instantly felt happier than ive ever been. 

Ive been naturally having the urge to eat (ive stopped becoming naturally hungry like 3 years ago when my depression started getting bad). Ive also decided to quit all drugs besides some hallucinogens and the occasional social drink.

Please, dont be afraid to try phycaedelics, you have to respect them and be safe with them, like any other substance, and they are BY FAR the most rewarding drug.

37052,Entheogens,Repost from /r/entheogens. Question of safety.,"*Hi, I'm new to this subreddit and reddit in general, was in read-only mode for reddit for a few years or so. Also, sorry for my poor English, I come from Russia.*

I've been into entheogens for a year trying new herbs here and there, from time to time. I have a mental condition which is manifested in depersonalization/derealization, depression (probably it developed, became really annoying and exhausting after Effexor w/d and closely related to that thing), lack of motivation, focus, problems of spiritual spectrum such as obsessive thoughts about the nature of ego and feeling dirty on the inside, restlessness, suicidal thoughts etc. I have also developed persistent insomnia after stopping Leponex a year ago and have been taking weed for sleep. I've got psychologically dependent on it and now have a HUGE tolerance. I've been like that for four years and I want this to stop. I have discounted all my meds completely, Effexor w/d was a hell of a trip and I've started to take kanna daily to help me cope with depression. I've noticed some improvement in general mood, motivation, I became more sensitive, emotions started to come back, I've started to talk so much some people couldn't stand me for a long time (not a bad thing, they are just noticing it and joking around bout it). So ye. But I still have all of the problems listed above, main are insomnia and restlessness, anxiety, lack of focus and motivation.

**My plan is:**

I've got myself some kratom and kava, I plan to alternate them for my sleep (first night -- kratom, second -- weed, third -- kava) so I don't get dependent on any of these substances and don't develop a huge tolerance, I also plan to measure doses on my scales so I don't end up rising up the dosage suddenly. I also want to continue using kanna as a daily antidepressant in the dosage around 1-1.5g. per day sometimes combining it with a little coffee to make a more noticeable boost.

After I've become (fuck your English tenses guys, for real) sick four years ago I've started digging into psychiatry and psychopharmacology world, I've been to many shrinks and one time I even ended up in the nuthouse. Three month of ""healing"" made me feel even worse. For at least three years I was convinced that psychiatry will help my problem, but today I am completely disappointed in shrinks, hospitals and traditional psychiatry and I want to help myself using herbs and spiritual practices, but still, it is hard to rearrange your mindset on this topic, that's why I fear dependence, I don't want this to happen. As my happiness in the natural state of mind is low as fuck and I don't feel any positive emotions I might have a great potential for psychological addiction development and kratom also has properties to make you addicted physically. Also I'm afraid of fucking up my brain chemistry completely with four different substances taken regularly, action mechanism of which is still unknown and very complex. Yes, I respect those herbs, but respect implies some amount of awe. I also have yopo on me with some IMAO herb (must be harmala) enough for two ceremonies and intend to go through one in a few weeks, maybe a month. I plan sharing the rest with my beloved one as she is experiencing some spiritual trouble, too.

**The question is:**

How dangerous is the path I chose? I feel like it's the right one, but my past life, experience and ideals, which are still hiding in the depths of my consciousness tell me to go back to taking medication and talking to my shrink. Shrinks and medications have never made me any good, so I won't, but my ""rational thinking"" is alarmed. What do?

BTW, if you have some advice on which spiritual technique to practice or maybe which books to read, you are welcome. I found McKenna very interesting and I am also a fan of psychedsubstance, dakota and some other psy-oriented youtubers.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/alnk39/repost_from_rentheogens_question_of_safety/
37058,Stimulants,I’ve never felt euphoria from ‘dopamine-drugs’. this is what I’ve tried:,"Yes I have some light form of ADHD that may contribute. 

Cocaine (couple times, different sources): energy in the form of restless high-strung adrenaline but no euphoria

Amphetamine, in various forms, various sources. This gave me energy and a very small amount of euphoria, but I think this is due to serotonin release.

Research chemicals: 3fpm, 2fmp, 3fmp, hexen, nep, 3mmc, a lot of cathinon based drugs. They give me energy.. make me nervous. And then I feel dysphoria but I have never experienced Euphoria from dopamine based drugs.

37064,Cocaine,MDMA/ketamine/coke advice needed,"Hi friends. I have a massive night coming up - a gig starting at 7pm immediately followed by another gig which ends at 6am.

My problem is I've been having MDMA a little too frequently (I know, I know) and I know that I'll get maybe 4 hours from the MD but any more MD after my initial dose won't really do much for me.

I tend to like to supplement my MD with small bumps of ketamine, but that's not going to keep me going either. I am meeting a bunch of friends at the second gig and really want to feel awake and sociable. 

My initial plan was to have my MD and ket at the first gig, then have some speed later, but it's impossible to get speed here since meth became a thing. 

So I got some coke instead. I'm not very experienced with coke(
 so thought maybe I'd start with the MD and ket, and have the coke later once the MD and ket have worn off a bit and I'm kind of straight (since I am supposing coke and ket at the same time are not a good idea).

I've been googling this combo and am getting mixed opinions - any advice? For what it's worth, I'm an average sized female, won't be drinking (maybe one or two drinks) and handle my substances really well, in general.

Will the xanax be effective enough to cancel the trip and allow me to sleep? I have 2x 2mg bars so I'm thinking it should be enough. Cutting my tab in half and opting for a slightly more relaxing 100ug trip is also an option

37106,Nutmeg,I tried Nutmeg 7 years ago. I'm sharing this story the first time in my life.,"I had been studying at medical university for already 4 years. Before this event, I hadn't tried anything but alcohol.

\---

2012, 5th of March

My closest friend tells me about Nutmeg ""You will find yourself somehow altered, heavy, it will be difficult to move, you even can see hallucinations"". I've always dreamed about something more than alcohol, so maybe this is it. Nutmeg is not expensive and is free to buy. Finally, I will feel high, though I don't know, can't imagine what does mean *""feeling high""*. I bought 25 grams during the lunchtime, and we are planning to stay at the university after classes. I am so excited - I will explore a whole new world for me today. The classes are over. Uni is almost empty. My friend and I are in Neurology classroom, cutting nutmegs into little pieces, so we can mix them with yogurt. The smell is so disgusting. Our cocktail is ready. We split the cocktail into two halves, so each of us gets 12.5 grams of Nutmeg. I try to figure out how it will affect my brain, my body, the mechanisms of its actions (typical medical student). I am informed that the effects will begin to show up after 5 - 6 hours.

8 hours passed. Nothing is happening. We did something wrong․․․

&amp;#x200B;

2012, 6th of March

Today I bought 30 grams (15 grams for each of us), it's going to work this time. Definitely, it will. The same situation again: university, after classes, my friend and I, cutting the nuts, making the cocktail, drinking. Evening. I feel no saliva in my mouth. This is it - starting. I feel a little bit dizzy, sleepy, hungry. Can't understand what's going on. I'm feeling this while walking on the streets. Probably I better go home. I'm home now. I want to sleep...

&amp;#x200B;

2012, 7th of March

8 o'clock. I remember, that nothing happened yesterday. I feel a huge disappointment. Probably being high is sort of illusion, that nobody feels but people keep telling they're getting high. Or maybe something is wrong with me. Probably I should try it today again. I just bought Nutmeg - 60 grams (**30 grams for each of us**), yogurt - 2 bottles. Today we have a cardiology course at the hospital.

9 o'clock. We made our cocktails before the classes, drunk them, and now we're sitting in the auditorium.

12 o'clock. I feel really sleepy. I want to sleep right now on my desk, have the feeling like I haven't slept for two days. I want to go home and have some long sleep.

2 o'clock. 5 hours passed after taking the Nutmeg. We had lunch, now I'm going home, and my friend is going to the practice at the hospital.

3 o'clock. I'm at my place, alone. Going to the bathroom to take a shower. Everything is fine, except I took 30 grams and don't feel anything. My friend is calling... I don't know how to react. He just told me it feels like he's flying on the streets and soon he'll be at the hospital. I'm angry a little bit because as always he's trolling me. Now I am under the shower. I have a strange feeling. The water comes out from the shower, touches my body very slowly. The shampoo comes out of the bottle into my hand very slowly. I'm thinking slowly. This is it, finally. I am so excited I feel something. I'm standing in front of the mirror. I can't move my hands, I don't know how to do it. I'm just staring into my eyes. They are like zoomed in 100 times. A shadow of my grandmother just passed behind the door. She's at home. I think I can act normally. I am clean, excited, and slow. Grandmother isn't at her room. Ok, her shadow is moving behind the living room's door. I just found out she's not here as well. I'm still alone. I'm hearing some high pitched sounds. Probably I should listen to some music. After the first notes, my head exploded. I don't want to hear any noise. I need to rest. I am cold. I am afraid.

4 o'clock. I am going to meet my friend. I am passing the cross-street (6 meters) during one minute. Everyone is looking at me. Everybody understands I took drugs.

5 o'clock. Here is my friend. Now I feel comfortable. I feel safe. What is wrong with my voice? I'm talking like a little boy who just started learning the words. It's funny. Trying not to laugh, but it's pointless. I just can't stop laughing.

6 o'clock. I feel so tired. It's normal. I've been walking for the whole day. Wait, no. I went out of my place 2 hours ago. What have I done during this time? What have I done today? I can't remember anything. It seems instead of 24 hours, hours of this day are endless. It seems I have stuck in this day for my whole life but I can't remember anything. My friend has the same thoughts. But he's not speaking for like 30 minutes. He's just accepting my thoughts by nodding - like a little kid... After more than an hour of silence, my friend asked me to hold his hand. He was scared and told me someone is taking him from his body, so he asked me to hold him and shake him. I did it for 20 seconds, he calmed down and thanked me. Few minutes passed, I feel like I'm drowning somewhere, so I can't control myself. Probably soon I will lose consciousness, but I'm awake. I'm not drowning, I'm losing my inner self, soon I will be empty. Got it! Now I'm feeling the same thing. My friend holds my hand and calms me down. He tells me, that he will save me, as I saved him. I'm starting to feel safer. Everything is fine now... I need to know is this real? Probably it's not that bad, cause he just answered to my question - What type of lipoproteins play a major role in developing of atherosclerosis? Wait a minute! It's gone! I'm telling him that I am alright, he just needs to understand that! Talk! Please, talk to me again! Why are you looking at me so strange? I'm so afraid of him, I'm so afraid of our lives.

7 o'clock. With a big difficulty, I called my brother. It's almost an hour I called him, but he's not here. It's not normal. He should be here like 30-40 minutes ago. ""You didn't call him"", my inner voice told me. Now I am afraid even more. I can remember how I talked to him. So it was not real? What was real today? Maybe everything is a big hallucination and now I am at my place? I need to wake up. Someone is pushing me. It's my brother. Why he was so late...

8 o'clock. I found out that my brother reached me after 5 minutes after my call. We are in the car. The skin of my friend is colorless. I think he doesn't understand what is going on. I can't remember his voice. Why am I feeling the beats of my heart? Probably I should check my pulse - 150 beats per minute.

9 o'clock. 12 hours passed. There is something in my nose. It's a nasogastric tube. I can see my friend - he is unconscious. Doctors have surrounded him. I think I lost him. I am crying. I am will turn off now...

I don't know what time it is. I feel a little bit better. My friend is looking at me․ He is smiling. I am sober. Now I remember every second of this day.

There was also an overwhelming tension and nausea that had me throw everything I had eaten up.

&amp;#x200B;

Slightly after, I was confronted with vasoconstriction that was unbearable to say the least.

The visuals were very strong, but I started feeling very uncomfortable in my own skin.

After about ten or twenty minutes, it was overwhelming to the point where I was about to have a mental breakdown.

I am not sure whether this was because I was still coming off the flu, but this may have contributed to this.

&amp;#x200B;

I can with confidence say that this was the scariest and most uncomfortable experience I have ever had in my entire life.

There was a point where I was very close to calling the ambulance, because it felt like I was going to die.

&amp;#x200B;

I took 1mg of Xanax, and around 30-45 minutes after the trip was eliminated.

&amp;#x200B;

It will take some time before I will even consider taking a smaller dose of this substance.

There are no words that can convey how uncomfortable this was.

Anyway, SWIM was wondering how long it would take 110mg of adderall to get out of their system, or AT LEAST enough to pass a test.

Well, actually it was about (and these are just estimates, they didn’t really count) probably 20 mg of Focalin (nasal), 25 mg Adderall (nasal), and 60 mg Vyvanse (broken open, powder dumped onto tongue, oral). Quite a binge, yes, they’re aware ;-)

So total, it would be 105mg (110mg to be safe) of zip RELATIVELY in the same family.

SWIM is aware of the half life rule, but if anyone can give them an EXACT (or approx.) amount of time it would take to be in the clear to PASS a test, It would be much obliged. Thank you!

Globally it seems, we forget the very real mental addiction and dependence it can cause to people?? Why? I am aware that smoking weed, is a lot better than shooting dope, but honestly.. We're spreading false information!! Branding weed, as the magic drug, with no downsides what so ever(?!!) The worldwide belief, is turning into an everyday stoner spiral, we're convincing ourselves that we can smoke, smoke and fucking smoke!! 

Weed can infect your memory, emotions (due to raised dopamine levels daily), productivity, friendships, family relations (e.g. you leave your sisters bday early, to smoke bud). Weed is better than most, but weed is **NOT** harmless!!  
Please don't talk about drugs, if it isn't true. If you aren't entirely sure about the harm, a drug may cause, don't talk about it. You can end up changing a life, for the worst.

Basically it's a very severe condition that can occur when people mix SSRIs like Prozac and other serotonergic drugs. This left me with a couple of questions.

Dextromorphethan is one of the drugs that can interact with SSRIs to cause the syndrome. I recently had a bad cough and took a lot of it. Also, I dropped acid in the last 3 months, which also can cause the syndrome when mixed with SSRIs. Am I at risk? I haven't had any drug of any sort for two weeks, and don't plan to while on Prozac, but I can't help but fear that any latent amount of these drugs still in my system could kill me when I start taking Prozac.

 But if we stayed there we would of been caught by them but we sprinted across back to my house whilst evading the golf course seccies 😂 

The scariest shit I have ever done when peaking on acid, is legit running away from security guards chasing you on there little buggy and you’re sprinting down the golf course high as fuck trying not to do die or whatever the fuck is going on. Shit got so funky when we got back to mine, and we watched a horror movie and with some good ass speakers and spent an hour a and a half wigging out to a movie, also spent probably the better half of two hours in the pool, which was fucking insanely weird hahah the water was fucked, literally felt like you were floating in space and shit, best feeling though. Recommend.

Now it is 4:30am and we are both awake in bed watching YouTube whilst high as fuck? Night bois and thanks for reading the trip report haha 😂

37381,GABAergics,Xanax/Etizolam for anxiety relief,"Hi, cross posting from anxiety cause I got no responses thus far. I've found that coffee, as soothing initially and enjoyable as it is, causes me to freeze up when making plans that would cause anxiety in the future, thus not drastically increasing my productivity unless it's for like a problem set or paper. Recently I was prescribed xanax and also got a supply of etizolam, and what a turn around. I emailed an old boss to resume part time hours and take on a new project that could build my resume, reconnected with a friend whom I haven't seen in a while and am not planning to meet tomorrow, actually got some reading done for class (and surprisingly retained most the info with my annotations), and hung out again (close friends but still beats sitting at home reflecting on that interview coming up).

Most of all, though, I am incredibly anxious about starting work again and interviews. I haven't had a chance to use these for those situations, but I was the type of anxious who would think about an extending family gathering 7 MONTHS before the holidays it was so bad. They weren't even bad holidays, they're good people, I would literally have trouble breathing for a few hours during these meetings and feel just so judged and awkward. Can't eat either. I'd gradually lead up to faking illness in hopes of not having to attend those few hours of what should just be straight up fun. The only times when I am not anxious is when I'm alone and with close friends doing something, but the former situation leads me to think about upcoming anxiety inducing events. I think xanax would be PERFECT for this working evironment, even now I have no fear of returning to work cause I know xanax can pull me though. I am hesitant, though, due to the potential of abuse, I have been addicted to video games when I was little but have long since gotten over such things. But xanax really does make me feel like I can live my life again.

Last note, I play chess competitively (not in person just online because I've been too anxious to meet my university club) and used to play at around a 1950 level on lichess (which is considered quite good). On 3mg of etizolam that dropped quick to 1700, then when I drank coffee and waited a little I managed to bring it back up a good amount and could probably bring it all the way back. It's clear that I am not quite as quick with my calculations and analytical ability under xanax but am far more ambitious and proactive.

What do you guys think? I was initially considering only taking xanax for those interview days and maybe work days when things are light, otherwise take a break and drink coffee to get shit done, but unless I'm doing serious calculations like in chess xanax seems to beat coffee for me every day. Hell xanax has given me the courage to even seek help online and with friends. The biggest fear is development of tolerance ad increase dosage, repeat.

TL:DR, xanax is changing my life for the better but I'm concerned, help!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/alszeh/xanaxetizolam_for_anxiety_relief/

I had a alsmot complete ego death. It started off with feeling like I made a horrible mistake and didnt go away for hours it felt like. The visuals were do crazy I was seeing triple of people  huge tracers. Everything was moving so much and changing do much I could make out the things around me. It even got the the point were I forgot if my eyes were open and closed. The trip felt really close to a really long DMT experience almost. 

The shrooms looked dark brownish on the cap with black/dark purple spots. The stem brown with white. And the gills where white. The shrooms was mostly cap and little stem. 

I really wanna figure out if I just had really strong shrooms or if shrooms just make me there bitch.

Knowing the lineup, I'm 100% going to candyflip on the second day of the fest, but I don't really know what to do for the first day. I'm leaning most towards MDA on day one, but am not sure if there is a cross tolerance and am worried that I won't be able to get my candyflip right. 

I'm aware of the MDMA/MDA study Shulgin did that showed there is not any cross tolerance if you do lots of MDMA and then follow up with MDA, but I don't know how it affects LSD or if it works the same way in reverse order. In Shulgin's study MDMA  was taken first and then MDA after, so my question is would it be any different if MDA is taken first, and then MDMA then next day?

Im planning to do something new and interesting this Weekend, im experienced with a lot of drugs expecially Stims but now i want to free my mind a little and i hope you guys can help a brother out.

Im looking for a kind of mind clearing experience cause i feel like my creativity and love for live is currently supressed,
I started smoking, snorting Amphetamins, popping xans too much and last time i did MDMA or Shrooms i felt....free of the need to do drugs and generally just happier all around, so my plan is to experience this again.

I got a Pill of 240mg MDMA and god knows how much 2-CB in it (its a Pharaoh if you have any infos regarding this pill)
I could do LSD even if i dont feel entirely ready for this one.
I could also do shrooms, had one Heavenly and one Hellish trip with them so my thoughts are pretty mixed.

So to finally come to my question do you have any ideas what drug i should do,
Also do you have any ideas to optimise my setting? My drug experiences are always heavily influenced by my surroundings.

Any answers are appreciated

Hope yall having a great day!

37586,Advice,Drug rotation advice,"This is my first post here, so please bear with me. Also, mobile, sorry for formating.

So there's this techno music festival that I'm really looking forward to. It takes place towards the end of May and I'm looking for advice on safer and more responsible drug use.

The thing is, this festival lasts 7 full days at least and to roll in every single day of it is just daft. I have a lot of friends that are taking this approach, but I don't wanna deprive myself of happiness and joy for a few days of really good fun.

I was thinking I can use different drugs on different days so that I can get the most out of it.

The thought of rolling, either MDMA or pills, every single day for 7 days straight, just isn't a good idea. I've seen people roll like this and in the 5th day they really aren't having that much fun because of lack of serotonin and pill tolerence, a point which I don't wanna reach.


So, what can I use in 7 days of techno goodness so that I can get the most of it and not end up dying in the process? I'm really looking forward to your suggestions.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/alvbij/drug_rotation_advice/
37599,MDMA,Ive been on Ecstacy for 24 :/,"So i took this ecstacy pill (my first time(said it was a molly based ecstacy, i obviously did not trust that and took it anyway)) yesterday at 4pm with my girlfriend and then when she left around 8pm i barley felt much besides a gitty feeling but we were really
Affectionate yk? Since she was on prozac (i did research on prozac and zoloft and for like a 1 time use it was suppose to be relativley safe) she didnt feel much. I decided at 9pm to smoke part a blunt then redose. Nothing happened besides the same thing and my door would breath and my pillow would make those wave things. When it hit 6am i was still feeling it. I went outside and smoked the rest of the blunt and there was this massive beuatu that lied around everything and i ended up hugging a tree and laying in this lucious grass. I then went into my room and stared at my ceilling for hours because it would melt, i saw these colored orbs after everything got completely blury. The little wave thing that happens to walls and roofs when ur on acid happened to the roof. And it was like 3 different effects. (I also had to stare at a certain point for 10+ seconds to get these visuals(the longer i stared the more intense they got))

    It hit 12pm and im still high. At this point im very confused because it was not chilling out at all, then it suddenly just stopped. No comedown or anything. Then at 2pm it just fucking ramped back up. When my girl got home from school she was telling me that she saw electricty that was orange and green shooting between the blinds. There were alot of colors but only really dark blue, dark purple, green, this baije, and a hot pink. It was all very dark and sinister tho. And its 5pm now and ive had mild visuals and she still hasnt come down, (she is very small and only 90lbs) even tho ive taken alot more. I can only assume we do not have ecstacy and i think it being cut with meth and heroine are ruled out. but idk anyone else have an experience like this or any info? I did some research but i couldnt find anything here on reddit or on google n shit. 

     P.S. i use to fuck with benadryl and it seems to effect al the physchadeics i use , occasioanalyseeing shadow people and spiders, and sometimes having those vision things, and a body load. It also happens when im sober. I also have bad paranoia ive never had before i took the benys so maybe that would explain the darker feel this mdma had even tho it still made me happy beyond belief, it still felt kinda scary, and usually physcadelics, or any other drug for that matter, really overwelm me. Evene when i took 600mg of hydramine my first time it wasnt too  much. I devoloped the paranoia and other things the more i took it. Just a thought.

P.S.S. im still fucking trippin and its been 25 hours now and if u see spelling mistakes im sorry.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/alvhh6/ive_been_on_ecstacy_for_24/
