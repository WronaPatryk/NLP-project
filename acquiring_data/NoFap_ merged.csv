42,Relapse Report,Not being able to get past the 4 day mark.,"I just relapsed again, the only real positive was I wasn't watching porn, I just got hard, was alone and acted on my thoughts.

I never seem to last long past the 4 day mark, I start to feel better, more confident, etc, but for some reason my brain goes into sex overdrive. Like I find things that I shouldn't find sexual becoming sexualized by my mind.

Does anyone else have this problem?

Also, any pro tips for the new year?

The second day I had lots of urges but I wasn't distracted so it was harder to resist them but I got through it.

The third day I had no urges and I'm proud of myself.

This is the start of the fourth day and a whole new year, it's going to be amazing.

I was never a chronic masturbator, but it was at least once or twice daily (if I wasn’t chaffed by then).   Throughout the years, I’ve realized that fapping has has an affect on my sexual performance, I wouldn’t be able to cum as easily as the next guy would have.  I would literally have to stimulate myself in my mind to get going.  So hopefully, with this commitment.  It brings along multiple benefits that I haven’t felt before.  So here’s to the new year.

NoFap Record - 180 days

Current NoFap Streak - 48 days

Highlights of the year:
- Full-blown spiritual awakening

- Quit my “career”

- Got a fulfilling job (officially a temporary position that could lead to a more full position)

- Had a relationship that topped all my others before it. (No longer dating) 

- Finally living in a location that makes sense to me, with a community that aligns with me. 

- Left behind porn and fapping in a big way. Life is so hard sometimes, but at least it’s better when you don’t fap. And *especially* better without porn. 

- My transformation is so complete in 2018 that I actually go by a new, spiritual name I received. I was named after my father and always hated my birth name. This new name is great and I really do love it. (Keeping it anonymous)

~

I used the be the “goal” guy. For 2019, I have no goals. 

I currently do have practices, including dynamic exercise and holistic nutrition practices, but I am not setting any goals. 

About a week ago, I sat down and journaled for around three hours, from around 12am-3am or so. I got super real. 

“What is it that truly matters?” I asked myself. 

“Finding my partner.” 

I feel that so much of my life is outside of my control, and that it does matter that I do my best with what I have, and take advantage of opportunities to better myself. 

But above all, that’s my desire. 

This is a wish and a manifestation I’m holding in my mind and heart. Holding it in my energy field, and allowing the universe to do what it will. 

I believe it will happen. 

~

Regardless of all that, I do feel a responsibility and duty to continue to do everything possible to uplift myself and my life. So I’m gonna keep on keeping on and hold this desire in my thoughts and prayers. 

My NoFap goal is 1000+ days! 

Onward to victory!

315,Relapse Report,I am a mess i need help :(,"I cannot fight this shit. Here is the honest truth in desperation to sort my fucking life out.

Started watching porn at 11, slowly escalated into fetishes such as nurse porn, then bondage and now femdom.

I am extremely ashamed of admitting that I am turned on by this and hate myself for it.

Honest truth- if it weren't for this shit my life would be amazing. I have a wonderful family, am successful academically and socially (no-one would even guess I struggle with something like this) have a beautiful girlfriend that I love with all my heart...

But here's the issue, I have been ashamed of my habit for a while but never had incentive to stop it. I met my girl and noticed I have PIED . She is very supportive and I want to fix this for her.

So I took action and started no fap...I keep managing short streaks but it always ends the same. I have a good day, go to sleep , start thinking about femdom/ something else sexual , roll around for an hour trying to fall asleep, then go internet or something to get off to something.  The only success I've had is staying away from porn itself, although I've looked at some fetish related pictures that are basically just as bad.

I need help, I'm addicted , 7 years of damage to repair. Clearly I have not got the mental strength to fight this. 

I feel ashamed, embarrassed and scared that this will ruin my life and my relationship. I am desperate for any sort of guidance.

I just relapsed again after a short 2 day streak. Did any of you go through severe fetish addiction?

I am a very emotional guy and I am completely in love with my partner. I know I can spend the rest of my life with her and she is literal perfection. But I hate the god honest truth which is I get more turned on by some fucking latex than her. I can't understand why my brain is like this. Is this damage repairable. Why didn't I listen to my dad when I was 12 and he used to say don't watch porn it ruins lives.

555,Motivation,"Lets all be heroes in our own right and make humanity proud once again, in this New year day !!","In these times of all-out commercialism, where anything and everything ought to ""sell"", people dont mind using the strongest human urge to attract people to their product. And there is this media industry that feed from such promotions.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence explicit content / mild softcore porn is increasingly becoming part of the accepted mainstream / social media. It is very hard to miss these nowadays and unless you have the mindset to actively ignore these, you are set to fall in this trap and will crave for more leading eventually to the ever welcoming porn industry, which will have your fate sealed.

&amp;#x200B;

You need to ""fight"" yourself , the dopamine craving brain several time a day, everyday  to deny it of this meaningless pleasure. Please know that if ever there are ""real"" fights for your life, this sure is one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Few decades earlier, humans didn't have to deal with such a rich and easy supply of semi / explicit content, and hence were more strong people with clear thought process and ""fought"" other evils of humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it is our time to fight this ""craving"" of ours, for we need our people to be free from this evil to be able to even start thinking about fighting other evils of humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

So lets RESOLVE to be heroes in our fight to defeat this evil of PMO ( softcore and suggestive stuff included ), every moment of our lives from now on , and make humanity proud once again for great achievements  !!

&amp;#x200B;

And what a great day to begin on the New year's day..  happy new year all !!

579,Emergency - Help!,Hurt my girlfriend for the last time; looking to you all for help.,"My girlfriend (19F) and I (19M) have been together for over 2 years now and I love her more than anything else in this world. We see eye to eye on pretty much everything, but the only serious point of contention in our relationship has been the topics of sex and masturbation.

I’m a pretty typical dude: high libido, masturbate about 2-3 times a week, LOVE affection from my girlfriend. My girlfriend, however, is the opposite: near-zero sex drive, hardly ever masturbates and didn’t even start until I encouraged her to, doesn’t like touching or being touched. She has also sworn off sex for multiple several-month-long periods during our relationship due to the guilt she feels after sex, and told me last week that she’s putting our sex life on hold indefinitely until she feels she can have sex without feeling shame. This, unfortunately, is not a great pairing for my admittedly intense emotional needs. As a result of our differences, I’ve been masturbating regularly as our relationship progressed; down from how much I used to before we met (I only masturbate now after we hang out, as I get extremely horny around her but never have sex, thereby causing excruciatingly painful/uncomfortable blue balls), but masturbating nonetheless. 

About 6 months into our relationship, she was scrolling through my camera roll (she likes looking at old photos with me) and she found a few nude pictures of random, internet girls that I had saved to my phone and had completely forgotten about. Understandably, she was upset, hurt, betrayed, felt ugly and felt that I was unhappy in the relationship because if I was looking at other girls, that must mean that she wasn’t good enough for me. I tried to explain to her that I only masturbated out of necessity (i.e. unable to sleep or be productive) and that I wouldn’t mind if the situation was flipped as I understand porn serves a purpose, but I eventually gave in and deleted everything off of my phone. She told me she was okay with me masturbating as she didn’t want to take away something I enjoyed, she just didn’t want to know about it or be exposed to it. But I love her, and I wanted to right my wrongs. I swore off masturbating for the next month, but ended up relapsing after our relationship was patched up.

Tonight, a similar situation unfolded in which she went to go permanently delete a video from my phone and again found nude pictures of another random, internet-based girl in my “Recently Deleted” folder. She was again very upset and expressed the same sentiment as last time, but more strongly as we had been through this exact conversation before. I feel sick for my actions and putting her through this fucking mess and I want to make sure it doesn’t happen again. I also recognize that I have a problem, because who the fuck would let someone they love experience this level of emotional pain TWICE.

This time, I don’t want to let her even give me the option of masturbating, as I want to make the decision to swear it off entirely. Obviously, masturbating has put a serious strain on our relationship and it needs to be rid of. However, with my high sex drive and inability to have sex with her (or anyone, because I’m not gonna fucking cheat lol), I have no fucking clue how I’m gonna do this. Was just hoping the wonderful people of this sub might have some advice about my situation or words of encouragement to steer me in the right direction.

After my first week with No Fap I just felt my urges sort of building up and bothering me so out of nowhere I messaged her just reaching out to a girl with no expectations. If she never replied I would just say screw it and move on, otherwise I would just take a chance and see what happens. I've been talking to her since that first week for the 30 days now, and today I kissed her. I've been so alone for the past while and getting desperate, but this girl wasn't a nobody. I had a huge crush on her from years ago that stuck with me and I genuinely believe No Fap gave me the courage and at the very least the drive to keep trying regardless of failure.

So selfish i know.

I feel like the worlds most piece of shit person. I feel so low and feel like others never ever value me and feel like they see me as inferior and naive and brainless guy with no personality.

I feel inane, ludicrous, daft, bonehead, witless, nonsensical..

761,Telling my Story,Day 1 of NoFap,"Hello fellow Fapstronauts,

I have previously attempted NoFap and I keep relapsing. Then, I attempted healthy masturbation after acknowledging that porn is destroying my life. It worked for a while. But then I ended up fapping to porn again. 

This New Years I said to myself ""to hell with masturbation and porn."" And decided to get back on NoFap again. If I ever feel the urge to masturbate, I can just get dressed, go outside and pursue real women. As a matter of fact, I am part of a group that meets and does cold approaches 2-3 times a week. I am working on improving my night game and approaching girls around their parents.

762,Motivation,"Gentlemen, you need to read this...","*This is my first and only post that I will write to this forum.*  *That being said, any corrections to be made upon grammar conventions and syntax would be highly appreciated, as this message is intended to be as comprehensible as possible*. *The work that has been placed into scripting the passage below cannot be even remotely compared to what must be accomplished by the words contained within. My hope is that the moderators deem it valuable enough to place a link to it on the sidebar or permanently at the top of the Reddit for others to reference should they need to gather the will to press forward in any pursuit in the journey of self-improvement. If this message is not worthy of that position, then I will take full responsibility for that, as I will have not only inconvenienced the reader for his time, but also will have failed in my attempt to provide him with a message powerful enough for him to make the necessary changes in his life to achieve the utmost, which was the original, and only, intent of the post.*

&amp;#x200B;

**As fireworks explode above us in the sky, I appreciate this opportunity to say what I have wanted to mention for a long time on this forum. I was at a loss for the appropriate words until now, and I am grateful for the insight that was provided in this moment. Not only does the following apply to this time of new beginnings, but it should also serve as impetus to start a developmental journey that will persevere through times of sadness, lack of judgement, and loss that we must be prepared for should such things manifest in the time to come:**

**I was in the military for only a brief period of time. Others who are currently serving or who have served previously know of this concept: Completion of the Mission. We MUST do everything within our power to complete the task at hand. We cannot lower our standards and permit deficiencies to pervade our ranks, for we, and the men who follow us, shall bear the weight of our failure. Do not allow the connotations of masturbation fool you simply because it is an act of a weak man that can be perform alone in a private space, within the confines of our comfortable society. There are very serious consequences for losing respect towards man's most precious asset. To protect it is our purpose, our responsibility, and for those of you who are reading this message, there is a reason why you are reading this.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Because you truly believe that this is a cause that is worth thinking about.**

**Worth saying NO to the strongest vice that man has and will ever experience.**

**Worth waking up 6 am or earlier for.**

**Worth taking cold showers for.**

**Worth placing a heavy rucksack on your back and marching 12 miles for.**

**Worth running a marathon for.**

**Worth taking insults for.**

**Worth taking rejection for.**

**Worth watching your language for.**

**Worth making your bed for.**

**Worth respecting others for.**

**Worth studying more and working longer hours for.**

**Worth exercising for.**

**Worth writing for.**

**Worth seeking help and guidance for.**

**Worth publicly speaking aloud for.**

**Worth meditating for.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Worth turning your life around for.**

&amp;#x200B;

**This is a call to arms, but do not undermine it on a T-Shirt, or a mug, on a sticker applied to your window that faces away from you instead of toward you, or as a memorable reference on an electronic device among other things. Let this remain imprinted forever in your mind, and may you perpetually consider your next move to be a better man.**

&amp;#x200B;

**It never ceases to amaze me how life invariably grants ambiguous options. Whether to do this, or to do that, or to do another thing. Whether to do right, or to do wrong, or to do something on the fine lines of morality. Whether to stop, or to walk, or to run. However, you will know this: Whether you are continuing along your path, or whether you have ceded. You will know whether you are triumphant, or whether you have failed.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Do not stop until you succeed. Maintain your faith and persist until you emerge on the other side to see the reflection of yourself in a bygone past. Understand that the journey may not end in that moment, for great men are far and few between. Be prepared to continue much further should the world need your service. In a life of nearly infinite choices that you can select from, the choice of discipline and integrity has been hand picked and presented to you as the single path to embark upon. I believe that as a man, this is not a mission that you choose. It is a path that you have been born into, and to accept a lesser fate would be a tragedy.**

&amp;#x200B;

**And my final words, to those who may need it at this time:**

**As men, you have been DESIGNED so that the world may taste the victory of success. This is why you have been chosen for this mission.**

**The world gave IT to you, and you only. You had IT in you before, even if you did not choose to believe. You have IT with you now. IT will never leave you till the day you die. Use IT for good and betterment, and the let the world shed light upon the potential of your destiny.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Ask the world for strength in times of need, and to you it shall be given.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Do something today that you would do if only you were not so lazy and not so undisciplined and not so uncommitted. Even if it makes you fearful and makes you tired and makes you feel ill. Like the pain of bodily injury or the pleasure of orgasm, all is temporary, a brief flash of an instant, if anything at all. Whether you are left empty handed or with a tool to forge your destiny to the distant horizon is dependent upon your action.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Regardless of your current streak, regardless of any sentiment of sorrow, regret, emptiness, or even any sense of accomplishment, regardless as to whether you are many years into the practice or have relapsed seconds prior to viewing this post, know that if you possess the fortitude to claim your victory today, then you will be able to do the same tomorrow. If you are strong enough to claim your victory tomorrow, then you will be able to do it again the day after. Then the week after that. Then in the month following. And in the years to come.**

**And you will be able to do it until the breath leaves your body.**

&amp;#x200B;

**But you must start somewhere, so claim it now, without hesitation, and rise towards your limitless potential.**",530,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/abhx1e/gentlemen_you_need_to_read_this/
780,Relapse Report,Relapsed after 50 days.,"Happy new year brothers! All i want to say bout relapse is not going to be a cliché like ""it's not worth it. For me it was a rational decision and i did it because i wanted to release urges and I wanted to see what it feels like after so many days out of curiosity. So i did it without porn of course . I'm not going back to porn ever again  (I am 3 months clean of porn.)The O was quick and it passed as it never happened so i did it one more time. Now i'm staying clean again cause if i did 50 days now i can go even more!!! So the conclusion is that if you relapse whether you do it rationally or not is that it makes your number 0 but it's all in your head. The progress is there. If you did 50,60,90 days the progress is there and now u can go for more. Basic is to stay off porn strictly. Then if you Mo once in a blue moon like once in 2-3 months it's no big deal. Nothing will change BUT be careful not to binge. I repeat do NOT binge! And meditate guys. Really,build this habit of 10 minutes a day . Sometimes u may be so in your head and bored etc but commit to it,put effort and you will see the results. I really appreciate the time you took to read this. Hope this helps! Peace and love to y'all ! ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/abi92r/relapsed_after_50_days/
783,Journal Check-In,Day 2 report,"The couple of girls in my life didn't bother to message me last night. Stories posted of them on Instagram makes me feel jealous.

Smoked a lot last night, was always a nonsmoker until the last few times I went out. I'm 30, too old to start that bad habit. No more of that this year. Didn't do anything for me.

Lots of attractive girls out, sex drive boost. Not to inspire a wank, to raise sex drive for next time. 14 days to go, one day at a time. 2 opens, weak. Got to get back in the game. 

---

Feel scarcity now. ""Why don't girls get magnetised to me? Why am I not one of the ones they choose to try and attract on nights out? Why do the girls that are in my life not bother reaching out to me? Am I creepy? Am I attractive but fuck it up by not making a move and appearing energetic and sexual?""

When the weed and alcohol wears off I can focus on strengthening my mind again, getting my self-esteem back on track.

Just get through today. No peeking. Already tempted but know it's not what I really want. I know fapping isn't the answer, when I'm back feeling healthy I need to use this energy to invest into becoming more attractive and making more effort to meet girls and ask them out. It's harder when feeling very hungover.

Need some paracetamol and antihistamine.

Want to peek but got to be a strong man today to feel like a stronger man tomorrow.

820,Question to NoFap,Disinterest in Video Games and PMO -- Relation ?,"I have a theory on video games and PMO. I've always loved video games. I watch videos on them, played thousands, owned 300+ console games through life (not to collect to play), know a lot about console game history, etc, ever since I was  child.   
I've found I play less and less games in the past few years, to the point where now it feels I get nothing out of it. Why is that, I wondered ? And as I explored that answer I came to the conclusion: PMO IS a video game, not a video.  


Hear me out. Your brain creates a dopamine effect that gives your brain and chemicals the illusion you had sex, whenever you PMO. So, to your brain, YOU were the one in the video. The one having sex (usually a faceless male or something alike) is your avatar and your brain creates a chemical effect that gives the illusion that you are interacting through your avatar. This is a fantasy world build by the chemical signals from your brain and a video. While the video is passive, your brain chemicals modify it to not be. You're directly inserted into this fantasy world.  


This is a similar effect to a video game. Your brain sees you as an avatar placed in this fantasy world, and creates an illusion that you are directly interacting with this world through your avatar. Most people use this as a means to escape reality, occupy their mind, and relax. The same way you probably started with PMO.  Would this not also be chemical in some way from your brain ?  


My theory is that porn gives a similar release as video games, and stunts your ability to enjoy video games. Does anyone else feel that this has happened to them ? Thoughts or ideas ?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/abipai/disinterest_in_video_games_and_pmo_relation/

854,New to NoFap,I got questions,"Hey. I am 15 years old, I started masturbating at 11 and watching porn at 13, and I've been on no fap for 22 days. I would like to ask some question and tell you what benefits I noticed so far. 

Benefits:
-Way harder erections (it almost hurts lol)
-Increased lucidity (I'm somehow more concious of the word around me)
-More time to do things (As I used to spend one to two hours a day masturbating, I didn't have much time to do my homework)
-Better sleep (I used to need 9 hours of sleep, now I only need 6)
-Better imagination (idk why but I do have a better imagination now, I just have to think about something to visualize it in my head)

Questions:
1-Does watching porn break your no fap streak ?
2-Do wet dreams break your no fap streak ?
3-Does reading erotica break your no fap streak ?
4-Does thinking about sex make the brain release unhealthy doses of dopamin ?
5-Does no fap really make you more attractive ? (It's holydays so I haven't approched a girl of my age for 10 days, that's why I'm asking)
6-Does no fap help you developing masculin attributes (beard, broad clavicles, stronger jaw) ?

That's it. I Hope you will answer most of my questions. Thank you in advance.

862,Victory,Every single day of 2019 is a new PR,"Today is my first time breaking 21 days :)

I first learned about NoFap in December of 2017, and was determined to make 2018 PMO free.

2018 rolled around and I probably PMO’d no more than 1/3 the amount I did in 2017. I got into this nasty habit of resetting every 3 weeks to avoid flatline. So all of 2018, I never made it more than 21 days. But I failed forward.

Today as I start 2019, I have a 22 day streak! That’s my personal best. Tomorrow will be a 23 day streak which will be another personal best. Every single day of this coming 2019 will be a new personal best. 

I did not plan for this to happen but the universe works in mysterious ways. 

I will make 2019 the first year without PMO!!

Love the support and motivation on here, let’s absolutely crush it 👊🏼

865,Advice to NoFap,Porn ended my marriage.,"Porn was the biggest factor that led to the breakdown of my marriage. I am the 28F wife of a 31M husband and my husband is severely addicted to porn. I didn’t find out about his addiction until 6 months after we got married when I caught him sex chatting with strangers on a dating site, making plans to hookup for a threesome. I was devastated but he begged and pleaded and we decided to work through it. Come to find out, he never stopped and was back on dating sites and porn sites the next day. Several months later I found texts exchanging a hotel address where he planned to meet up for his first “trans experience” with a trans prostitute. 

A couple months after that I discovered he’d had a 4-5 month long sexual affair with his ex the year before. He used her as an outlet for his sexting habit and met up with her for sex several times when sexting wasn’t enough. For all those who say that porn is good for relationships and couples should watch it together, their relationship is an example of how destructive that mentality is. They had an extremely toxic relationship before he met me and especially while he was cheating with her. They were both addicted to porn and would encourage each other’s porn habits. He would encourage her to engage in sexual acts with other people and to participate in sex cams/chatterbate. They would watch porn and sex chat together. He used her sexually and basically pimped her out to other people, posting sexual images of her without consent. He used sex to manipulate her and she ended up attempting suicide because of it. She ended things between them after months of him using her sexually while promising he was going to end things with me, his fiancé at the time. Nothing she did was ever enough for him sexually, even though she did everything she could to please him and indulge both their porn habits. 

Fast forward another few months and I find that my husband has progressed to seeking out underage girls for sexually explicit photos. He received pictures of girls (obviously being trafficked) as young as 12-13 and still requesting younger photos. I turned him into the police and he lost his job and was nearly arrested. He got off on a loophole because the identity of the girls couldn’t be verified and therefore their age couldn’t be confirmed. Thinking he’d hit rock bottom and would finally get the help he needed, I took him back. 

It’s been 3.5 years since then and nothing has changed, except his ability to hide his addiction. After 3.5 years of lies, manipulation, emotional abuse, and infidelity I have finally severed ties completely. This man was the love of my life and I have watched porn destroy everything he loves. I’ve seen him lose jobs, houses, thousands upon thousands of dollars, and I refused to have children with him because of his recurring addiction. He wants children and a wife more than anything but can’t/won’t give up porn. He’s overweight, has debilitating anxiety, barely sleeps at night, has nightmares, has lost most friends, and has no hobbies besides sitting in bed on his phone/computer. He won’t go to counselling unless forced and refuses to talk about his problems, only finds better ways to hide them. 

Please, not just for your sake but for your current or future spouse, keep up the fight against porn. I had to leave the only man I’ve ever loved this weekend because he can’t love me more than he loves porn. He chose porn over me the last 5 years and I’ve finally had to accept it and move on. He’s made efforts in the past but as the years have gone on, he’s tried less and less and now freely admits he will never change and is no longer willing to try.

I highly recommend cardio workouts. After the first week of hell, you start to live off how great they make you feel afterwards. A much better hobby than PMOing. ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/abla1k/first_run_of_the_new_year/
1019,Telling my Story,22 Years of Fapping: Leaving Behind a Destroyed Life,"I shared small bits of my story in various comments on this sub. Seeing a couple of posts with claims that porn is harmless, I figured I'd share my entire story in one post, both as a personal account of harms of fapping and as a cathartic release to start a new NoFap life.

---------------------------------------------------

I started fapping when I was 11—accidentally discovered it while playing with a water hose in a bath. I still remember my older cousin teasing me one time, saying I was too young to even get a boner, and me getting riled up about it, because I could already fap.

My introduction to porn happened roughly around that time as well. It was before we had Internet in our house and all I had was a couple of my dad's VHS tapes I could peek at sometimes. At other times, I would play my mom's tapes with music videos and fap to celebrity singers. I fapped excessively, maybe 6-7 times a day. My record, if I recall, was 16 wanks in a single day.

Fast forward two years, I got my first girlfriend… sort of. A mutual friend decided it'd be fun to convince the two of us to date, which worked out great. However, I was too shy to even *hug* my new ""girlfriend"", so less than 24 hours later she broke up with me. I said ""good"" to the news, and went back to the stress-free life of a chronic masturbator.

By the time I turned 17, you could still say I was just a normal shy, awkward kid. However, I started doing a few bizarre things. I fapped tons. And I would discharge right into my underwear instead of disposing of it properly. Multiple wanks, all crusted up right in my pants, sometimes for a couple of days—I don't know how I did not see a problem with that. I hanged around with a girl I liked a lot, but was too shy or too fapped-out to make a move on her. Eventually, I heard that girl loudly complain to a friend that I reeked of sperm all the time. That was the most embarrassing thing that ever happened in my life.

I neglected my health too. Not only did I avoid seeing a dentist to take care of my teeth, I also started doing drugs. Weed, shrooms, cocaine, ecstasy, ketamine, pain killers, and even crack. For the next two years, I've done them all.

When I was 18, I worked as a general helper at a construction site. Most of the job involved sweeping partially-built houses and covering the floor with construction paper. I fapped at work multiple times; would just put down the broom and wank in the nearest half-built closet. I always felt depressed and lacked all energy at work, which looking back now I realize was due to fapping. Eventually, I got fired.

Around 21 years old, I was still a virgin, desperate to lose it. Not having any girls who were even remotely interested in me, I decided to hire a prostitute. That's how I lost my virginity, and over the next 3-5 years, I have hired about 12 other prostitutes.

Around the same time, I have discovered that if I abstain from fapping for a couple of weeks, all my anxiety and insecurity would vanish. I'd feel like a million bucks—the feeling that would disappear just mere 20 minutes after I would fap or see a prostitute. I began to realize that something was wrong with me and that I could only be mentally normal if I avoid orgasms altogether, which looked impossible. Due to social anxiety, I started to avoid the few friends that I had as well.

When I was 24, I fell in love with an amazing girl. We hanged out as friends for a couple of years. I was a needy, insecure, obnoxious ""nice guy"" around her, which I believe was due to me fapping and seeing prostitutes during that time. I read a bunch of books about confidence and body language in order to improve myself. There was definitely a benefit, but I was still far from normal.

Since I knew abstaining from fapping made me feel great and confident, I went on a nofap streak of about 4 weeks. What a difference it made! The neurotic and insecure boy was gone entirely. This confident, funny, amazing man took his place. Even my acne that plagued me my entire life vanished. That girl I loved definitely took notice.

We were at her place watching TV and things were starting to get physical. But, they didn't even progress to undressing, because my penis was burning and I felt like I really had to pee all the time, so I kept going to the bathroom every 5 minutes. Looking back, it might've been something I caught from a prostitute. I went home that night and fapped, and that confident man immediately vanished.

That girl found another guy. I got depressed and became an alcoholic for three years. Eventually, liver pains forced me to work hard on stopping drinking, and I involved myself in an open source programming project that kept me clean. I still fapped daily, however. And I still was a neurotic tangle of anxiety.

I learned about Autism and read about its symptoms. I had every one of them, except for learning deficiencies. I contacted a psychiatrist, who quoted me around $3,000 CAD for an official evaluation and diagnosis, but said I could do it for free if I could get a referral from my physician. I wanted to get that referral for several years, but my social anxiety was so bad I couldn't bring myself to visit a doctor on the bad days, while on the good days, I didn't think about needing to see a psychiatrist.

I eventually left that programming project, after having multiple fights with other members. My social anxiety was severe enough that I was even doing laundry manually in my bath tub, to avoid going outside of my apartment and taking the elevator to the building's laundry room. I blamed my behaviour on my ""autism"" and thought I couldn't help myself, other than abstaining from fapping that I knew ""cured"" it, but life with no sex was not for me. I did not yet realize it was fapping that was causing my mental issues and not the healthy kind of sex (which I did not have).

One day, my boss invited me to a large convention. He kept saying that he knew I was uncomfortable around people and that I didn't have to go if I didn't want to, but I knew that if I'd stop fapping for 3+ weeks, my ""autism"" would vanish and I'd be a normal person at that convention. That's exactly what I did and it worked great. The confident, funny, amazing man was back—until I fapped again, after the convention was over.

Soon, a management position opened at my company, to which I applied. I didn't get it, because the hiring manager thought I was too uncomfortable around people and would not do great at the job, as it involved dealing with a lot of people.

That brings us to the present day. While spending an entire day on Reddit, because I was too brain-fogged and depressed to do anything else in my life, I somehow ended up on r/NoFap. Someone mentioned getting the ""super powers"" after weeks of nofap and it immediately hit me. I did not have any ""autism""! Abstaining from fapping did not ""cure"" it! I only had a 22-year long masturbation addiction that was completely fucking me up. The confident, funny, amazing man that appeared after weeks of nofap was the result of getting rid of that addiction—and my earlier confidence and body language studies definitely helped me be more confident and self-assured than the average guy.

---------------------------------------------------

Now, I'm almost 33 years old. I avoid talking to people, including my coworkers. I don't have any friends. Never had a real girlfriend. I lost out on a lucrative management position. I have mental issues: severe anxiety, depression, lack of energy. I have health issues: acne, obesity (due to past alcoholism and now no energy to work out), bad teeth (too much anxiety to see dentists). It would be going too far to claim my fap addiction to be the sole cause of it all, but looking at the evidence, it's hard to deny it was a major factor.

But… that's the old me.

Thanks to r/NoFap, I can finally see clearly what was damaging my life for all these years. I can finally do something about it. After quitting alcohol and all those drugs, I can finally rid my self of this final addiction.

Thanks for reading this very long post. It feels great to get this off my chest.

The confident, funny, amazing man is back. And this time, he's staying.

1030,Journal Check-In,Day 4 - Dreams and Triggers,"From my records Day 4 is traditionally a strong relapse day so I was on special guard today... and it's a good job I was...

After a late New Year night I've been deprived of sleep AND I had some pretty arousing dreams.

(But interestingly since giving up booze in October, this was the first time in my adult life that I've gone to bed on New Years eve fully sober and woken up completely on form with no sign of a hangover. This was AMAZING!)

Anyway, the dreams turned into waking fantasies... my mind kept going down paths that are NOT helpful to the NoFap mission, but each time I was pretty good at catching them and (after reading Napoleon Hill's stuff about Sex Transmutation) I managed to turn the energy into positive channels...

I have a sign right next to my bed that asks ""How would it feel to be a ... \[my ideal life\]?"" (I have another next to the bathroom mirror)

Whenever I look at that sign I can immediately take any negative thoughts or excess energy and put it to creative use, imagining my ideal future and figuring out how to make it happen.

And so the afternoon was spent on my 5 year plan, and getting a really solid plan for the next three months. It's really exciting, I have a mission and some really specific stuff to work on... and it's world-changing in its scope.

So a day of moderately strong urge beginnings, all caught early and redirected.

Tomorrow might be another matter... back to the 'usual' routine... so I must keep busy, keep on-mission, be kind to myself and stay alert at all times.

Hope you've all had a great Christmas and New Year, and I hope that 2019 is filled with the growth and success that you wish for!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ablfj0/day_4_dreams_and_triggers/

English isnt my first language, but im trying to make you guys understsnd what im asking.. im afraid of being called any of those. Maybe im overthinking all of those. 

But maybe its true. I try to make others laugh too much... im afraid of others not valuing me.

1080,Confession,Going Dark,"Hey guys, so the past two months have been pretty bad. My addiction nearly controlled every aspect of my life. I nearly lost my girlfriend, and I might have lost my chance at a college degree (in the process of appealing an academic dismissal). So things are dire. But there is hope. I’ve taken some pretty intense measures to fight this. No video games, no smartphone (dumb phone comes in tomorrow), no use of computer in private (it’s staying at gf’s house), and daily journaling. Not to mention reading, rigid daily schedules, studying (if they let me stay in school) and working out. My computer fast extends to most social media (unless it concerns helping me find a internship for the summer, so linked in is allowed) and it includes reddit. These crazy measures will be in effect until I have been six months clean. 

So this is goodbye, for now. But I promise you, just like I promised her and others who I’ve hurt the past two months, this isn’t the end of me. This is a new beginning. Im making this one count. Because it has to. Because if I can’t break free of this now, I won’t ever be free.

I think the first person could pretty easily pick up where they left off because they got momentum rolling on many other things in their life.

1211,Question to NoFap,I want to make a better porn blocker in 2019 - are others interested?," Question: do others struggle or find issues with the current p-blocker solutions, and would they be interested in using a smarter blocker?

If enough people are interested, I'd like to build a solution that uses recent developments in artificial intelligence to finally curb P addiction.

Problem: I've struggled with P addiction for years and relapsed again yesterday. Honestly, it's ruined my life. Throughout this journey to a PMO-free life, I've used all the porn blockers available for mobile and desktop (e.g. k9, offtime, pluckeye, cold turkey, blocksite, ect.) to help prevent a relapse. However, these apps have major drawbacks:

* **Misses Triggers** \- Triggers occur well before we're consciously searching for P.
   * It could be a comment or image on an instagram post or even a clickbait news article about some couples' unique sex life.
   * Today's porn blockers only help us after we've been triggered, by blocking the obvious content like nude images and videos, but at this point, it's too late and we'll find ways to get around it.
* **Too easy to circumnavigate** \- When we decide to watch porn, we find a way.
   * Today's porn blockers give you a password or a toggle to turn adult content off and on. When I've been triggered while being in a depressed state, I simply locate my password or toggle off, then I relapse.

Solution: I work for an artificial intelligence company that focuses on computer vision development services, and we could build a better product to help keep nofapers on the right track if there's demand for it.

* **Triggers** \- using machine learning, we could predict browsing patterns to prevent triggers from surfacing, before you even realize they're on the page.
   * It would locate the earliest signs of a potential relapse (like scrolling through attractive girls on instagram) and immediately redirect, distract, or simply censor the triggers for you.
* **Circumnavigate -** artificial intelligence can be used to create a series of barriers, depending on what's most efficient for you, to prevent finding a way to view P.
   * The AI would go as far as recognizing when you're trying to avoid its blockers and based on your choice, either shutdown browsing so you can cool off, to creating a series of tasks that you would have to complete before viewing the content.

I'm sure there are many more ways we could use neural networks to defend against PMO addiction, and I would like to include the nofap community in the development process. This won't be the ultimate solution, but machine learning could go a long ways in helping us find freedom from P.

1403,Seeking Accountability,Any mostly straight/bi guys looking for accountability buddies?,"Sup my dudes, I'm a 27 year old mostly straight guy looking for an accountability buddy(s). 

I'm kinda new to this (been on nofap for 17 days) and I'd love to find another guy in the same boat. I'm definitely someone who's looking to be with a woman longterm but still don't mind messing around with guys sometimes. I'm fairly certain that it's not HOCD or anything as I've been attracted to guys for a long time but never wanted to be in a long term relationship with a guy. but at the same time I'm fully aware that PMO addiction has let me to some strange stuff. so it would be nice to find out what's going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I don't wanna get into the whole thing now, but it would be great to find another bi guy or mostly straight guy with similar stories/mindset to be accountable for nofap.

1433,New to NoFap,Finally going to do this.,"Hi all! I'm a 24 year old woman that's used porn since I was about 15 or so. At first I didn't even realize this counted as porn was it was ""true stories"" that didn't even involve sex that I read online. I also didn't begin masturbating and orgasming until I was about 18. But since then I haven't been able to stop. Two nights ago I logged into my pornhub account and was disgusted to see I've had the account for three years, specifically to save my favorite videos.

I'm so tired of this cycle of telling myself I'll never do it again, then giving in. I'm hoping to find some support on here as I'm too ashamed to reach out to anyone I know irl. I plan to do Hard Mode for a week as my first personal goal but I'm praying I'll be able to make this a lifetime thing.

1438,Motivation,Overcoming a bad mindset,"Feeling like I've royally messed up, like I've been spent and that the highlight of my life is in past.

The thing is, I've had this recurring feeling for a long, long time; and in hindsight it's beyond clear its just a mental thing.

Like, my life obviously wasn't over as a high school freshman. The feelings of failure I had in my early twenties like, ""I used to be smart and capable, but not anymore"" were later followed by new pinnacles of achievement and progress.

I want to make a life-long vow to No-PMO, and only ejaculate when I am married. In September, I want to be able to say that I have been clean and sober from PMO for 9 months.

1523,Question to NoFap,Porn : Setting up exceedingly high expectations,"It is a known fact that pornography does that and makes your mind believe and expect certain things that are not possible to occur irl.

1577,Advice to NoFap,2 things that work,"As we all, start this year in an effort to quit, I wanted to share two things(tips) that have worked for me.

I have found that I tend to relapse when I think about PMO, videos, etc unable to control myself. In other words: thinking about it -&gt; urges -&gt; looking at pictures, videos-&gt; eventual relapse.

The key is to disrupt these paths and prevent yourself from getting to the relapse.  The first thing is about not thinking about it so that you don't get urge. The second one is for if you do end up thinking about it and get the resulting urges.  These two together have helped me so far

1. **Don't think about it, at all cost-** push any thoughts out of your mind if you can, if they're too hard to just push away find something to distract yourself. use a hobby, take a walk, something and anything to take your mind off.

* I've heard creating a list of productive or non-destructive things that make you happy or give you pleasure and then doing one of these to prevent relapse, helps a lot. But I have not tried this.

**2. Make it harder/less convenient for you to relapse-** If you make it harder or impossible for you to search up videos and images or see them, it's going to be much easier to not relapse because you have no option to.

Since I always relapse on my phone, what I did was use content restrictions on my iphone. I restricted browsing of adult content which blocks pornhub, any explicit images, etc. I also restricted all apps 12+ which prevents you from using apps like youtube, instagram , etc. I then asked my sister to set up the passcode for restrictions(I just told her I'm trying to quit social media)  and not to tell me until end of march, by then I'll reach my 90 days. This has prevented me from quickly and mindless search up something on youtube that usually causes me to relapse.

If my laptop ever becomes an issue. I'm just use stayfocused to block youtube, any adult websites I use and then set a timer for 1 minute, preventing me from using it to relapse. Yes, I love youtube and use it for beneficial things sometimes but it's so so not worth me relapsing. I'd give up youtube for a year if it gets me to quit. If i really need to use youtube for school or something in the meantime, I can use a library computer where I won't relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

I really hope this helps you. If giving up using a certain app/website will help you prevent relapse, I definitely recommend it. I think all of us have to give up something in order to get free.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/abqr43/2_things_that_work/
1616,New to NoFap,"Hi, I'm new and I need some pointers in breaking my addiction","I'll save you the scrolling down to TL;DR and put it up here: I'm a teen who wants to break my addiction, and pointers in the right direction would be great.

It's not surprising I developed a porn addiction. I'm a teenager, I have Aspergers, the usual. So it's not surprising I took up to watching porn quite avidly to not only cope with my oh-so-stressful life, but also because I'm a young teen who naturally gets turned on quite often.

But I'm tired of it. It's ruining my life. I used to love music. With incredible passion. I used to love it so much, I am working to apply for the Berklee College of Music. But this porn addiction is ruining my ambition and making me lose the feeling and love for playing music. I want it back. It's also ruining my social life. I mean, it probably doesn't help that I have Aspergers but I'm sure I would have at least a *few* more friends than one right now if it wasn't for my porn addiction, I am aware of how much it can affect you socially. It's ruining my drive to do anything, and even feel like my old self. When I do too much porn I feel like a worse, shittier version of myself, like a Lite version of me. 

I have done research and I am developing a plan that I hope I have the guts to bring up w/ my mom, but I would really appreciate tips from people who are farther along than me, and maybe tell me something I haven't read yet.

1652,Telling my Story,I give up,"For the past 10+ years I’ve been enslaved with porn and masturbation. I have never been able to be clean for more than a month... if I had to describe my 10 year progress in one word it would be “relapse”... I’ve experienced not just the brief pleasure and the short term satisfaction that comes with porn and masturbation but I have also experienced the emotional and physical toll, the guilt, the depression, the mood swings, the progressive depravation of my mind, the emotional numbness, etc. 

In another time I would have said that “I am tired” and in fact I used feel tired of this vicious cycle but not anymore, what I am feeling now is beyond tired, I am starting to embrace the idea that it is impossible (at least for me) to quit this habit. I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore I give up on this fight because for more that I try, I end up in the same damn place if not worse. My bad habits are now progressing to sexting with strangers regardless of having someone who loves me and who I love.

As any other addiction, I often find myself spending the little energy I still have at the end of the day to go back to the same cycle... I am not looking for motivation... For those of you who are still strong and/or still have energy to fight, make your effort count and escape this cycle forever.

I typed in a question that was related to masturbation and this guy pops up. I am stunned this guy has made over 400 answers and every single one has been dedicated to the 'harmful' effects of masturbation. The only harm is in its over-indulgence. It can destroy relationships, can cause pain, and become unhealthy like any other activity taken to addiction-levels.

At least when we talk about the topic of masturbation, it should be done with the right information. Not some hack on the internet giving no sources to back baseless claims. We as a community on curving our unrealistic desires and unhealthy habits should not be like this guy.

1742,Success Story,How I Broke the Vicious Cycle,"I’m 19 years old and I am proud to say that I am no longer addicted to Porn. 

I still remember the day that I realised that I was a chronic addict. I was trying to study for Exams that I was so screwed for but every time I sat down to study urges would come and fuck me up till the point that I was wasting hours jerking off my miserable self. There was one day that all I did was literally watch porn. I woke up watched it before I even got out of bed and the rest of that day was just so fucking sad. I watched it again after lunch and then before bed at night. I remember sitting there and thinking how am I ever gonna make anything of myself if I keep going down this road. How will I find Love, Wealth and stay Healthy if I can not control these impulses.

So I embarked on No Fap and I failed time and time again. I tried to block porn on my internet but whenever my urges were too strong I would just take down whatever restrictions I put in place and watch that shit anyway. Although No Fap is a great starting point it never really worked for me, the longest streak I have kept is around 10 days. What did work however is abstaining from porn but still masturbating when needed. How do you do that? Well use you’re imagination, think about that cute girl in class or your crush, girlfriend, wife but make sure you don’t think about videos you watched or impose sex acts that only porn stars would do on the girl you are thinking about because that defeats the purpose. 

Some people think this is creepy or weird but what is fucked up is watching porn, contributing to an industry that exploits young women for there bodies and makes millions of men suffer from depression, anxiety and feelings of inadequacy. In contrast using your imagination is perfectly normal natural and causes no harm to anyone including yourself. Its more time efficient in the sense that you don’t have to spend hours looking for that one video where the girl is perfectly waxed, lighting is on point, boobs are just right, ass is nice etc and if you do it in the shower it’s a lot easier to clean up as well. But most importantly how you feel about yourself at the end of a Porn Session versus a solely masturbation session is a massive leap. Porn is what has fucked us all up not masturbation and you will realise this if you take my advice.

But staying away from Porn is not the answer you have to find a way to replace it. One of the best ways to do this is to spend time improving yourself in every way possible. I started working out more, studying at University more instead of at home so that I can’t watch porn, I got a part time job, become friends with some dudes at Uni and went to more social events. Doing all these things meant my mind was always busy and occupied which lead to less time thinking about booty, less urges, less relapses and more self improvement.

But still there was something missing I wanted a relationship and although the personal development helped sometimes the frustration of not being able to meet a girl lead to relapse on a few occasions. You see the primary reason men watch porn is because it is far easier than going to the effort of getting sex in real life and as a product of nature we tend towards the path of least resistance. Why spend months improving yourself, risk going out and being rejected when you can literally be a couple of clicks away from having not one but multiple beautiful women take their clothes of for you for free and do things that a real girl would never be capable of. Why? Well to put it simply because it’s worth it.

You see I was lucky enough to meet a girl who is now my girlfriend of 7months. Although I think she is cute, sexy and beautiful she is far from the girls you see on porn. But this is fair no man can expect their girlfriend or wife to be as perfect as those pornstars are made out to be. There sole purpose in life is to show off there bodies so of course every time you go on pornhub the girl is perfectly waxed, make up on point, ass and tits are perfect cause they are probably fake or edited. You cannot expect to get what you see in porn in real life but it doesn’t mean the real thing can’t be better in other ways. For example my girlfriend has also become my closest friend, her personality is amazing and our chemistry is great. This is something porn will never give you no matter how many hours you spend watching it. Even the one thing porn does give you which is basically sexual simulation with an infinite choice of beautiful partners doesn’t even come close to the feeling of actually making love to that one girl you really care about. If I am being honest my girlfriend is probably average looking but the sweet moments we’ve shared together makes me feel sexual attraction towards her in a way porn has never made me feel about any girl. Sorry if I sound like lovestruck fool but this is the truth. I understand these feelings may not be the same years from now as our relationship is relatively young. However this doesn’t change the fact that her entrance into my life has been instrumental in my recovery and for that I will be forever grateful.
 
Although I managed to get my addiction under control with my No Porn approach, self improvement and since meeting my girlfriend. Occasionally I 
Would still fuck up and watch porn. But this is ok it’s a process. I think of it like fast food it’s never good to have fast food for your health but there will be times that you are tempted and that you do give in. What’s important is that you get back on track quickly. Porn is the same it’s never good to watch it but occasionally it can happen. Don’t get me wrong my end goal is the same as everyone else here which is to never watch pornography again. But right now I am happy with being in control, I am most certainly not an addict anymore and this is something I am immensely proud of. 

I have to thank this community because knowing that there are thousands of other men battling the same issue as you is a huge support in everyone’s journey.

1780,Advice to NoFap,Urges are NOT bad... here's why...,"I've had a mindfulness practice of some sort for 14 years now, and been *really* serious about inner work for the last two years. And it took all this time to realise something really important... and *very* helpful in the context of NoFap...

Last night's reading, along with some emotional exploration overnight made me realise that urges aren't bad at all.

**Urges are** ***simply energy moving around in the body.***

The problem is that we've been taught from a young age to *suppress our emotions,* especially those of joy and excitement.

So when the emotion of joy shows up, it triggers our ""be good"" programs in our mind, it triggers our fear of reprimand from parents, it triggers our guilt for being over-excitable as a child and we *suppress and resist* the joy.

**We take one of the most beautiful emotions we can experience and turn it into an enemy.**

""I *must not* experience this feeling. I must do everything I can to make it go away. I must FIGHT.""

There's another way to handle this, and my exploration and experimentation last night supports this theory...

We can stop telling ourselves stories about how these feelings are bad... fear, guilt, shame, anxiety... and instead recognise that they are actually feelings of *love* and *joy* and *excitement* that we've been trained to avoid.

Then, as the feelings rise up and move around our body, instead of fighting them, we accept them in... we allow ourselves to feel the pure joy of being alive... it's an incredible difference.

**All we have to do is 1) become** ***aware*** **of the energy in motion in our body (most of us suppress it subconsciously without even recognising its presence) ... and 2) change the story we tell ourselves about it.**

I'm not saying this is easy... but it sure is simple.

Let go of the years of conditioning telling you that emotion is bad. Let go of 'being a good boy' and being 'well behaved'. Let go of trying to please your parents and teachers and other authority figures.

**ACCEPT the energy flow in your body. Allow the feelings to move around. And recognise them for what they are... they are not your enemy, they are your greatest friend and biggest source of life force.**",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/absmi0/urges_are_not_bad_heres_why/
1783,Journal Check-In,Day 0 - A Fresh Start (all comments welcomed),"I have accepted this as a long term battle and so am feeling encouraged. Unlike last time I started it is a more realistic encouragement. Last time it was bound to waver off, I told myself I never will masturbate ever again in my life no matter what, and took very little action to prevent that without setting up a plan/ making any lifestyle changes whatsoever.

Regardless it was still a positive process that taught me a lot about myself. Firstly I learnt a good deal about my triggers and took action to prevent them from occuring. For example I noticed that almost all of my relapses have been during the night so I set up application/internet blockers from 1900-1200 everyday.

There are also positives, whilst I have MO'ed quite a bit over the last 2 weeks, I have not watched porn since beginning this journey. Yes I have sneeked onto instagram / looked through my photo gallery but I have avoided the biggest culprit.

I still have a very long way to go and while the last 2 weeks have been an emotional roller coaster I can say that I am glad I jumped on board. There is progress, there will be more progress, this is just the beginning!

So whats my plan?

**Here are a few things I need to consistently do, no ifs/buts/or whens!**

\- Weight training every single day before sleep to prevent

\- Cardio every morning (yes these first two bullet points are realistic , I am a generally speaking fit guy)

\- Post on Reddit at least once a day, and absolutely every single time my urges start to get intense. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

\- Make sure the following though goes through my thought process every single day, ""***What you have gone through may be judged negatively by society but understand this. It can happen to anyone, you were exposed to porn at a very young and vulnerable age and such an addiction, whilst horrible, is expected/normal to occur to any young man just developing his sexuality. No matter what you have looked at to get off / still turns you on always remember- you are a fundamentally good, healthy and confident person. This addiction does not define who you are, and like any illness you are taking actions to defeat it. It maybe a long journey filled with ups and downs but you have already taken the most important step, the decision to fight it.*****''**

**Well here are the few things I still need to fix immediately!**

\- Get rid of the remaining photos in my phone gallery that may potentially get the better of me!

\- I have done well when it comes to blocking access to my phone but something needs to be done about my laptop as well. Whilst so far I have simply left it in a different room at night meaning that I cannot be bothered to go get up and use it to MO, it could easily be a cause of a future relapse and this needs to be dealt with.

\- Set up a plan of action when it comes to those pivotal moments when I am fighting the urge. Perhaps one thing that I most regret so far is that I do not think I have successfully overcome a strong urge, even once. Yes I have managed to sleep through it once or twice but it would still be there the next evening and then I would give in. I find that I lie around too much, and think too much. When I think I persuade myself it will be OK to MO. Hence I need a plan to prevent this. 

**On my next blog I will . . .**

Explain what actions I have taken to ensure that the bullet points above have been dealt with plus give other actions that I realized that I must take next as well as giving a brief on how my mindset is feeling.

Honestly any comments would be appreciated, whether its a good lucks, or any advice. Feel free to also talk to me about your journeys. 

I hope you all have a lovely day!

1829,Other,I need some advice,"First, I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to put this. But I need some advice, or rather feedback on a situation with a girl that’s driving me nuts.  I feel this community is very welcoming and helpful and would give some good more male advice.

So yesterday was New Year’s Day. Every year we celebrate with my extended family. And this year one of my cousins brought two of her friends along. She introduced them to everyone and they were both pretty attractive, but I didn’t think much of it at first. 

So we started playing games, and one of them was asking me questions throughout. Later on during dinner time, we were just hanging around eating wherever and she sat next to me and started talking to me. Eventually this lead to her asking me some very personal questions, and I didn’t mind answering them because when she talked to me I felt very at ease and that she was very understanding. And I think this is when I developed a crush on her, she seemed very smart and caring, not to mention she has the most beautiful eyes I’ve ever seen. 

However, after this she spent the rest of the time with my cousin and the other friend. But when we were leaving and saying goodbye to everyone, she made sure to hug me goodbye. At this point I wanted to ask for her number, but I didn’t want to do that in front of everyone and there wasn’t a time where she was even kinda by herself so I could ask without feeling like I was pressuring her.

So we get home and I told my mom how I felt and she gave me my cousin’s number and I texted her, “Hey ___ . I really enjoyed meeting ___ today. I was wondering if you could ask her if I could have her number?” She responded later and said she would give her my number and if she was interested she could contact me first. 

It’s been close to 12 hours and I still haven’t heard from her. Honestly, this situation has me pretty stressed out, cause I thought we had some great chemistry and I definitely want to talk to her more. Did I misread the situation? Is the way I handled it weird? If anything is too vague and you need more details I will give more. Any advice would be very much appreciated.

I don’t feel smarter, more awake, stronger (I gym regularly) or even happier. I haven’t really experienced any differences with other people, nor any more confident. Hell, one behaviour I’ve developed is I gave up social media (which is what led to all of this in the first place) and, soon, porn did too. Funny how that works.

 So what I do? I fucking jack off even though I didn't like it. Because it was already an addiction and I didn't know how to deal with it until I found out about nofap. My longest streak was 26 days last year and now I think I can go to 30.

 With the lessons I've learned from my past experiences I can now fight the urge and use it to be more productive because its still an energy.

1882,Journal Check-In,A new look at 2019,"Hi everyone,

First of all, Happy New Year! I wish you all the best in the upcoming year.

One of the challenges I want to take up in 2019 is stop masturbating and (more importantly) stop hammering  my mind with adult conent, which I've probably seen multiple times already. Just a bit of background about myself - I'm a 22 year-old male with a, I would say pretty serious, foot fetish. It's been almost 10 years since I first found out about the existence of foot fetish-related content and I've devoted (wasted) quite a big part of my life to watching all of these photos and videos of women's feet. I've realized a while ago that I shouldn't keep on doing this, watching all these videos and frying my brain with this unecessary stimulus, but it's proven to be a pretty hard task as of now. I thought that a good way to further help myself in this battle is to share my story here and have an additional motivator to keep me going and staying fap-free.

I am using a nice, little app called Quitzilla, according to which I'm currently on my 4th no-fap day. I would like to try and see how leaving my penis alone for some time can benefit me as well as my relationship. I've been going out wih my gf for more than a year now, she knows about the foot fetish, she's fine with it, however at times, I think this fetish thing is getting in the way of my love towards her (both mentally and physically).

So, yes, this was a quick intro of me. I will be sending updates from time to time just to keep you posted of my progress. THANK YOU for creating and supporting this community. I've been reading some of the stories on the forum and it's great seeing all the positive and motivating responses. I am hopeful that sharing my experience with other people would be an additional stimulus to keep myself disciplined and not relapse. Let's see what happens.

I wish everyone, who's decided or is planning a change, a smooth and relapse-free nofap joruney.

&amp;#x200B;

 

@Update 08/02/19

It's been a month since  I haven't watched fetish videos / pictures  and it's worth saying that urges have calmed down down a bit. First goal would be to keep this up for at least 90 days. 

&amp;#x200B;

@Update 15/01/19

I was having some fantasies about my gf and decided to use these thoughts to masturbate to. Althought I wasn't looking at any foot feitsh content, I still feel bad for the wank.Reset.

&amp;#x200B;

@Update 13/01/19

Soo, I had to reset on the 9th January. I managed to resist some serious urges a couple of days before that, but something came over me (stress over exams and a fight with my girlfriend might have contributed) and I lost my progress. To be fair, I don't think I properly set the rules for my nofap journey at the beginning. Now, even looking at a porn-related videos would imply the need for a restart. Hopefully, imposing stricter rules would alllow me to be more disciplined and keep to my plan.

&amp;#x200B;

@Update 05/01/19

The last 2-3 days have been a bit of an internal battle with my thoughts. I spent some time watching content I should not be, but I managed to resist the urge to fap to it. Generally, I still feel a bit overwhelmed by the idea of exposing myself to feet-related pictures/ videos, but I feel more confident that I am able stop myself from binge watching these stimuli and refrain from masturbation. I'm currently studying for my exams and during my short breaks I would go after fetish-related content as my brain is wired into thinking that I would gain something positiive from this, but I realize that's not the case. Nevertheless, it would take a bit of time to reboot. My plan is to continue my no-fap journey, but try and keep the mind more disciplined and not let it run away in search of a short-term burst of serotonin.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/abu69x/a_new_look_at_2019/

1909,Confession,Relapse on Day 5,"I pretty much noticed all the signs... even as the relapse got closer, I was *just about* aware that I could stop it, but didn't.

The pattern started with lying in bed too late... I could easily have got up at 5:30 this morning... I was awake anyway, but I went back to sleep until the alarm, then slept another 1.5 hours after that.

Had a headache, probably from too much sleep.

Did my morning routine ok... had a super healthy breakfast... got a good chunk of work done... then I think the next mistake was going out for lunch.

I like to get out and meet real people, but I loaded up on carbs. Since that moment it was pretty much downhill... growing headache. Drifting on my to-do list, going through NoFap to make me feel better (instead of getting the work done that I was meant to be doing), then got kinda lost in this fantasy world and before I knew it I was gone.

Didn't use porn though, but did have unhelpful ""low self-worth"" thoughts and behaviour.

Interestingly, the headache that came on from the carbs went *really* intense after fapping. It's just starting to subside a little now, some 10 minutes later.

I'm not going to feel shame or guilt... I got to day 5 (when day 4 is my 'usual' relapse day). I will be more vigilant on my next day 5... I'll be *really* careful of those early warning signs.

1913,Advice to NoFap,"As someone who failed time and time again in 2018, here is what I learned.","I kept reading these big success stories of people who have made it really far in their NoFap journey and that’s awesome! But personally I am not as strong as some of you out there and wanted to share what I’ve learned in 2018 when my longest streak has only been a little over a month, but this year my goal is to go the whole year.

1) Most success does not come without failure.
-you will fall, but when you do, get up stronger, turn it into a positive and make sure you learn something from it.
2) Streaks are great, but someone laid it out like this, if you only slap your turkey once a month the entire year, that’s only 12 times. But if you go for 3 months then have a big relapse and jerk it 6 times in a week and do that again after 3 months, you are already at 12. Being consistent and never giving up are huge. If you relapse let that be the only relapse, the first week was always the hardest for me. (That being said, try not to count streaks, but instead take each day as it comes and treat it uniquely)
3) GO TO THE GYM AND STAY BUSY
Cannot stress this enough but find some sort of physical activity to let off the tension and each day will feel much better, I found the one or two days I didn’t go to the gym or didn’t get out of my house were almost unbearable and I would relapse 50-60% of the time.

The most important thing out of this is to just never quit trying. You will feel like a huge failure and like you can’t get past the monster that is porn and masturbation.  The truth is, you can, sometimes it just takes time.  We are all broken, and every person is different in some way, just remember that because someone climbed this mountain in 2 months doesn’t mean it will be the same for you, everyone has a different path/journey to take.

But there is one problem, having somthing real is far more dificult than just looking at something at the screen and jacking off, and I don't really know how to get somthing real. 

&amp;#x200B;

For about a month now I started going out more, started looking for girls at instagram and started using Tinder, but I haven't been succesfull in any of this ways, and looking at girls at a screen added with my will to have sex has brought back some really hard urges, and I think that that lead me to my wet dream this night. I'm talking more to girls but none of them will lead to something.

2031,Motivation,Running the NOFAP play when you're in a relationship.,"Dear Fapstronauts,

I find myself two months in on a PM fast. Don't think I've ever gone this far without porn or fapping  since I discovered their existence. Sounds ridiculous but it's true. I'm 35 years old and I've probably never gone more than a week tops without abstinence. 

Lately, I had been choosing fapping over having sex with my wife. It was quicker, therapeutic and most importantly, it happened whenever I wanted to. Also, I increasingly found that sex with the missus was getting a bit boring. We've been together for seven years, and although she is genuinely one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, things just get a little bit repetitive. But we consider ourselves a great couple and are very much in love. No emotional issues at all.

On many occasions, she wanted to have sex but I had secretely already fapped one out. So I wasn't really all that keen and would make up an excuse. Also, I had to increasingly imagine more  hardcore sexual stuff to climax.

Porn makes everyone believe that women love to always give oral sex, take it up the back door and let guys finish on their face. I'm not saying none of those things are untrue for everyone, but I'm convinced they are untrue for the vast majority of women. Porn had undeniably set a very unrealistic standard of what sex is in my mind.

I wanted to find a way to jump start our/my sex life and so I stopped watching porn or fapping over eight weeks ago. So far, this is what I've noticed:
- We have sex more often AND I'm always up for it (cracks me up but sadly an important point 😂)
- Sex is genuinely better. I desire her a lot more. Subtle things like the touch of her skin or hearing her breathing patterns are a lot more of a turn on. Most of the out-of-character hardcore stuff has left my mind
- Orgasms have easily doubled in intensity (we only have sex one or twice a week and I'm not sneaking off in between)
- I no longer feel like there is a discrepancy between my sex life and the perceived standards. Taking a step back, the dynamics of porn even seem a little silly.

So there you go. Don't know how long I'll do this for, but so far it's been really great and comes with a sense of accomplishment. I want to encourage all you dudes in long term relationships, husbands and fathers to give this a try. Don't expect superpowers, but you can definitely expect a change. 

So in short, do yourselves a favour for the new year : man up,  get your shit together, lay off the porn and sleep with your girl like a normal homo sapien you weak bastards!",84,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/abwfk7/running_the_nofap_play_when_youre_in_a/

2049,Motivation,Having trouble making it to two weeks? Imagine there was no private window tab in safari....,"Oh wait, you can actually do that by going to the settings in your phone and turning on your restrictions for websites. That’s one of the things I learned last year. Also, if you relapse the next few days you’ll have the chaser effect (any slight stimulation or being alone could lead to another relapse) but if you make it a few days with no stimulation, you’ll hit a flatline and have no sexual urges what so ever. I experienced a few flatlines last year and in these times it can be the toughest because you might try to get a boner just to see if it still works (It does and it’s never worth a relapse!) .... 
Will your life be that different with restrictions on? You might cave and turn them off a couple times, but to make it 2 weeks and beyond you’ll have to dump the images that are in your brain of pornography, which can only be done by not exposing yourself to that type of material. Removing the pathway to the material is one part of the battle, the next part is the mental battle. It’s okay to appreciate beauty but if you get fixated on it and get yourself worked up (staring at girls at the gym or something) you might find yourself in a tough spot later that day.

One last thing, it’s tough to get back on the horse sometimes but we all realize we want to stop viewing this content. Do what works for you and don’t beat yourself up. Progress is progress, I’m 23 and last year I never made it past a month BUT I did fap a hell of a lot less than the year before and I always felt best when on a streak.

&gt;I'm 25 and it's been more than 2 years m struggling to get rid of pmo  shit. I relapsed on jan 1 and after that i felt miserable and depressed but  now m going to start again.  
 i've deleted the p collection from everywhere on my device.  
 It's like now or never for me m going to make rest of 2019 po\*n free .  
 The reason m doing this is because it has desturbed me mentally (social  anxiety, depression, insomnia, headache, brainfog) and physically (PIED,  weakness, fatigue)  
 not only it's effecting my personal life but also professional life.  
 I can't focus on my work my creativity is not like as it was before.  
 I can't talk to girls because of lack of confidence i was not like this before.  
 I felt like crying right now as this habit is ruining my life for 10 years.  
 for me m not against fap to be honest because m not addicted to  masturbation but m addicted to po\*n and that  is the real culprit for me  and my aim is to never ever watch it again no matter what.  
 going to start my journey and will keep on writing here after each small victory.

Slipped around 3pm...

As soon as I slipped I cancelled my gym class for the evening. I didn't feel like seeing anybody or leaving the house.

But 10 minutes later I was back on form... I decided this was not going to become a full relapse... just a one-off... luckily my class wasn't full so I could book my place back on.

Got some useful work done between the slip and the gym, and then went and had a good work-out.

A little disappointed to slip so early in the year, but what is a date anyway? It's just an arbitrary number give to the day.

I was on day 5 which is a day later than most of my slips, and I had *so* many hints given to me that I didn't pick up on... so I will be more on my guard next time to spot any sign that I'm leaving the path and nip it in the bud.

2126,Motivation,I'll break my streak right now to prove you too can go 300+ days.,"I want to help someone with the worst possible streak, maybe someone that can't go hours without fucking up. My life has changed after 6 months, pursued what I've always wanted to do (career wise), extremely confident at work, confident in public settings and no more randomly getting hard at the slightest stupid softcore on TV/Internet Ads, etc.

If you're too embarrassed to admit that you literally can't go a few hours without breaking your streak, DM me. I'll be your accountability buddy. Create a Google Voice number, or give me your real number, idc, I'll text you, check up on you and do bro shit with you. If you think you need to relapse or literally can't control yourself you can give me a call/text. I want to jump start you and keep you on track for 90 days.

I find **personal joy** helping others - So if I can help you, let me know. I thought NoFap would be hard (no pun intended) and i've failed miserably, countless times. But after the first 90 days, I was a new fucking man. I want you, anon, to experience what I went through so that you too can feel excited about this.

I am not guaranteeing you that I can fix your situation - but I can guarantee you that you'll have a buddy that knows what you're going through and will be there when you need him the most. I also open this up to anyone else that would like to take on this challenge with someone else - What do you say?

**TL;DR - I am willing to break my cycle and start on day one with a stranger that can't go longer than a few hours/day without relapse. I will be your accountability buddy and stay in touch with you and guide you to 90 days. Why break my streak? It brings me back to day 1 with you. That's how serious I am.**

* Delete all apps except reddit on my mobile phone
* Take a walk/run everyday, and do pushups, pullups and plank, too
* Meditate (either outdoors or indoors

Weed has helped a lot from having stress and not to fap. It is a great medication for those that are above age and is legal in the state you are living in.

For the noobies to no fap don't give up, the first week, hell the first month is the hardest. But don't give up! You can do it! Just smoke some weed be occupied and if you really want to just take a cold shower, cold showers are very great for not fapping and it also helps the body.

2344,Motivation,Reflection,"Whatever the confusion in my head was based on; I knew the innate depression and sense of being lost was due to lust. Desiring women has been a norm since before I even knew what I was looking at. The urge to sleep with another woman became the sense of envy enveloped around others with women that fit my distorted taste.  I began to sorely envy men who bragged about who they slept with and how their experiences were. This unhealthy desire blinded me to the occasional women I did end up with. Fleeting relationships built on lust sex and desire. Now as I look back I see how most of my relationships were just exchanging bodies like toys whenever the desire a rose. But God has shown me the light! It is  at a distance but it's visible! Sexual sobriety, it means to learn to hate the very mind control that left me broken. Now more than ever my heart yearns to hate my sin. I dream one day of the day sex will ignited strong and difference, when envy towards a woman's body seems foreign to me.

2353,New to NoFap,2019 is the year for me - deleting porn accounts. Any suggestions?,"I want to finally go all in with NoFap this year.

I've attempted NoFap before in the past, but I could never get past a week. This year I want to make great strides and become a healthier person. So tonight I'm deleting my Tumblr blog (4+ years of porn, but most of it is blocked because of Tumblr going to shit), my Twitter account (started in the beginning of December), and I'm getting rid of all the porn subreddits on my backup account.

Does anyone else have any suggestions for keeping the streak up? I try to keep busy, but I live in Upstate NY, where there's nowhere to hang out with people or do things. I spend most of my time on the computer since I write a lot of code and all my friends are online. I appreciate any and all ideas.

2508,Confession,Got laid,"And now I feel like shit. 

Was just a hookup with my old friend with benefits from the summer. The sex was alright but woke up the next morning feeling like shit.

Technically first time I came since September, I’ve edged quite a bit during the school year and I’m not proud of it but I’m working on it. 

Anyways I thought having sex was gonna be awesome again but I was wrong. Doesn’t feel as bad as relapsing but doesn’t feel good like on a long streak. I have no feelings for her, we barely relate and just have the occasional sex. I just feel really confused because I’ve wanted to have sex so bad the last couple of months and then yesterday came and it didn’t feel good at all. 

I don’t have the brain fog after a relapse but I have the old lonely sorrow I haven’t felt in months. 

Completely different than having sex in a romantic relationship. After doing it with my ex I would be beyond happy it was an amazing feeling. Hookup though was empty af. 
For all the guys out there just wanting to get laid with random girls so bad, sure it feels good in the moment. But the next day you’re gonna wake up full of regret.

2513,Question to NoFap,Staying strong even in my dreams,"Been a while since I've attained two week status no PMO. 
My brain is starting to fight me and send graphic dreams which I resist. Not going to lie it's pretty draining fighting these urges. Nevertheless gotta stay strong.

One thing that always bothers me when abstaining for around 1-2 weeks is that I notice my member gets very sensitive to sensations. Does anyone know why it gets super sensitive? Is it the brains way of releasing excessive semen? Really curious if anyone knew why hyper sensitivity may be a symptom of nofap for some. 

The sensitivity is like being able to relapse from the slight brushing from your boxers. It's pretty intense. But from experience, this sensitivity does go away between week 3 - week 5",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ac1uwe/staying_strong_even_in_my_dreams/

2559,Advice to NoFap,An idea that might help with motivation,"I was watching a Jordan Peterson clip, and he was talking about how someone should go about quitting pornography. He said that it’s actually better to have the goal to improve and care for yourself in general (of course that includes not being addicted to porn).


He recommended actually writing down a description of your future self 3-5 years from now if you cared for yourself like you would care for someone else. This is intended to give you a clear vision of what you’re even working towards while improving yourself.


Then also write a description of what your future self would be like if you didn’t take care of yourself, including any negative things that come along with porn and masturbation addiction. He also said that this description should scare you and can serve as a reminder of what you don’t want to become.


I’m finding that it’s actually quite motivating, especially since the negative version of future me is quite the disappointment haha

2673,Advice to NoFap,Every relapse is a habit learning process,"See each relapse as a learning of your own habits both in mind and in what you do, for example from my previous relapses ive learnt that they almost always happen when.
1. Im at my computer late at night doing something and suddenly get urges.
2. Just waking up in The morning and staying in bed or delaying getting up and doing my Day.
3. Letting my own emotions during bad days take control over me, might be things as hopelessness, depressive thoughts, feeling anxious, low mood.
4. Thinking about pmo and letting it slip bit by bit until full blown relapse.

Now to cure my own causes of relapse and yours too, you need to change The behaviour that caused The relapse.
1. If you get urges late at night at your computer, go away for a bit or do something else.
2. When you wake up, meditate if you do that then go straight up and get your Day done.
3. Emotions are very hard but understand that in The long run a more balanced life with good habits replacing bad habits Will also balance and let you be in control of your emotions, even if you think that seems utterly impossible right Now.

4. Once you go into thoughts about pmo, whatever you do dont act on it, develop The thinking that however small The act towards pmo is, it Will lead to a relapse, because The more you do, edge, look etc The hungrier your brain becomes and it wont be satisfied until you relapse. Trust me your brain is very very hard to control if you are slowly slipping up.

2701,Advice to NoFap,Preparation Tips,"I’m on my longest streak in a while after hitting low hooking up with a random girl from the bar. Will be fap free all 2019 that’s for sure.

Reminded me some things you may find insightful:
- Plan on what you’re going to spend your time on since your mind is going to obsess about staying busy. Don’t waste it on social media, learn a new language, do laundry, get serious about your work.
- A powerful part of NoFap is feeling intense emotions again. Don’t suppress them, let them out. Cry at that movie, tell your friends and family you love them when you feel it erupt.
- Wet dreams happen. They’re pretty cool, good sign of progress, but don’t go looking for them or you’ll be right back to fap.
- Quit other addictions before or during, or they’ll become pleasure surrogates. Fast food, soda, women, etc.
- Stop drinking alcohol or taking anything that lowers your inhibitions. One way ticket to fap or hookup.
- We often move to fap because we’re shy of women, so when we’re recovering from fap, we often suppress our feelings towards them. This isn’t healthy, and I would encourage you to actually exclaim your appreciation for them, their beautiful form, it’s actually quite freeing and I think it helps us from succumbing to cheap faps. You’ll seek only your highest ideals, which forces you to be your ideal.
- We watch porn because it’s a fantasy. When you truly stop, your mind starts to rewire into how to get your fantasies in real life. Instantly you start focusing on improving your job, body, and life. This is the actual start to that sexual energy transmutation mumbo jumbo, and eventually it’ll stop being about sex or women and just be about the pleasure of achievement.
- Boredom leads to fap. Stop being boring.
- At some point in NoFap, you’ll feel like a lion in a cage while sitting in your room. You want action, but you’ll be caught between your own social anxiety and sexual desire, but I encourage you to best your fears and step outside, even alone, and be amongst the people. You’ll be surprised how good you are with the girls, and it’ll calm your nerves.
- You’ll notice smaller details more, life becomes more interesting because you’re interested in it.

I’ve been here a lot less since I’ve gotten things under control, but take my example that it can happen again anytime. I’m not sure if it’s ever possible to overcome, but it does get easier. Good luck all!

2720,New to NoFap,Is it too late? Please help me through,"I'm a 40 year old married man. Here's my story in brief.

Ever since having been sexually abused by an older girl when I was just 7, I've masturbated. I realize now that I masturbated throughout my teen years as a coping mechanism for any kind of academic pressure or stress. That has escalated to PMO in my 20s and, well, PMO has escalated in terms of the formats of porn and the frequency.

Here's what I used to believe: 

- I have an addictive personality
- PMO will help me unwind before sleep
- PMO keeps me sexually interested and strong
- PMO is a great fallback for when my wife rejects me for sex
- PMO is something I can control
- PMO is an escape from work anxiety
- The sexual abuse was not harmful to me as a person

Here is what I now know to be true: 

- PMO has created dopamine highs which have caused and made it difficult to give up on my other addictions (e.g. smoking, alcohol, sex)
- PMO has robbed me of many hours of sleep and created a fog when I am awake
- PMO has made me sexually weak and caused ED which has hurt my wife
- If my wife rejects me for sex, then working harder on our connection will lead to closer intimacy and better sex when the time is right for her
- PMO has been totally out of my control and escalated during my life
- PMO is entirely a cause of my procrastination, anxiety and depression
- The sexual abuse was a trigger to MO and PMO and so has robbed me of a normal life but at age 40 I am determined it is not too late.

In 2018 I discovered all of this by reading about Nofap and thanks to forums like these I learnt all of the symptoms. I only managed an 11 day steak and it was intensely difficult.

Please help me brothers as I don't want it to be too late to change my life. Any other similar stories or motivation would be appreciated. I want to go 2019 PMO fee but know how difficult and rewarding that could be, all at the same time.

2724,Question to NoFap,Anyone here think that healthy masturbation is achievable for porn addicts?,"M39 here. Single but with plenty of past experience with girls and relationships. Got into nofap around 3 years ago when I realised I had an unhealthy relationship with pmo and was probably addicted. I've achieved 90 days once and 60 ish days a few times. My question is about masturbation without porn. In my experience, whenever I try masturbation without porn it eventually leads me to a full pmo relapse. 
It seems perhaps,the safest bet is just to write off all forms of masturbation and only ever have orgasms with my future gf/wife.
However I do still find myself wondering about the possibility of learning how to masturbate healthily without running the risk of ending up back using porn. 
Any of you guys have any success stories? Is it even possible for someone with porn addiction or am I better off simplifying the situation by giving up all forms of masturbation for good?
Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

I didn't even cry at all.I got bullied in school.I also lost that bit of self esteem I had before.I beacame depressed.I started playing video games even more.I tried with 2 yt channels,but none got any views,so I gave up.This is shortest part of story I could possibly tell.That happened in 2015,and I'm depressed since.My parents  are noticing my social awkwardness,but they don't notice depression.I belive that I don't need therapy to get over my depression,I Just need strong will.

2772,Advice to NoFap,"What if we are just ""In Heat""","Hey guys.. I think we're just going In Heat!...

Seriously!.. What if because we are Men and the way our bodies are designed, and seeing it be as we don't have a mating season, we could mate all year around if we wanted too. However, by doing so, we risk wasting ourselves away (literally) so in turn, just like most, if not all other creatures, we should wait until we are ""In Heat"" before we mate that way it insures we don't waste too much of our seed! Which literally constains the essence of our life/energy/happyness.

Sperms (Living Organisms) = Life:

Testosterone = Energy:

Semen = Happiness (Semen is an Anti-Depressant)

Guys, I think we've got this all wrong!

Simply put.

1 We are not supposed to ejaculate evey single day! Reason:

we could easly lose too much of our seed and become incredibly weak!

(Seed = Sperm-Testosterone-Semen)

(Sperm = Life)

(Testosterone = Energy)

(Semen = Happiness)

2 Losing too much seed is not good! Reason:

1 Sperm count becoming too low for proper reproduction leads to infertility!

2 Losing too much Testosterone can cause us to not only become very weak (over-all) but entirely throw off our bodies natural chemistry, causing us to lose ourselves and our masculine characteristics/traits.

3 Ejaculation of our Semen everyday leads us to losing our happiness (Literally) leaving us with feelings of mass depression and anxiety (Semen is an Anti-Depressant after all)

Perhaps, this is why all the creature's of earth seem to exist in ""Perfect Harmony""

2787,Confession,"I confess, I have a problem and would like help.","Ok, I have a problem. I guess that's the first step, isn't it? To admit that there is a problem. I have been masterbating since I was a teenager. Back then, I didn't have high speed internet so the naughty channel was the best place to start. I'm now in my mid 30s, and I have been plagued by depression, low confidence and suicidal thoughts since my teenage years. I have seen some success, I was able to complete a BSc, and got a scholarship to study in Europe. I still felt like shit though. I have had a girlfriend for about 5 years but stayed because I was simply afraid to finding something new. It was a relationship that wasn't going anywhere. 

The year 2018 was about changing and growing. I've finally moved out, I have a decent job, I'm now able to accommodate women on my terms in my space, but I still wanked almost every night to porn on my phone.

My first opportunity came this Christmas, I got a nice supple young lady in my space for a weekend. I could not perform. Over the three days, I was able to have sex twice, not because I didn't want to. Oh God I wanted to. I simply couldn't have a lasting erection and I tired very quickly. I only orgasmed once during my sexual encounter with her.

This is a source of great angst. I've not been able to sleep at nights. Is my sex life ruined? Wtf? I am not able to talk to anyone about this, I hope this community will be helpful. I hope nofap will help with my erectile dysfunction. Maybe it's my nutrition? I have not been taking care of myself lately as I eat very little, and I'm not obese. I should lift weights though.

So far, I've not jacked off since the last day of December 2018. What else should I do? Should I also exit dating apps like tinder? Should I take supplements? Should I work out? 

Any suggestion would be helpful. I just really would like to start living a normal life. They say everyone has there own race to run, but God damn it I feel like I'm in last place, particularly with relationships with women.

2797,Advice to NoFap,A new Dawn,"After doing nofap hard mode for about 4 years (it wasn't a streak, most of my streaks were a few months to a year long) I started relapsing hard half a year ago. Mainly because I thought I had already ""done enough"" and because people kept telling me it was abnormal *not* to pmo.

It was the first time my addiction was even worse than before I started. I started making excuses, telling myself that it's ok because I'm just exploring my sexuality (which is theoretically a good thing, but it wasn't what I was doing) or that I still had to figure this out. That I still had to find the right way of doing this. That I had to experience more to be able to judge the situation properly. That I would find a balanced way of doing this. Maybe without porn. I didn't. I wasted half a year. All this ""experimentation"" brought me nowhere except back to square seven.

I began to stop believing that I could make pmo fit into my lifestyle, but for the last few months, I have been unable to regain long streaks like in the past when I relapsed. My lifestyle and my mindset had already changed and those take a long time to change back. I gained weight and basically broke my personal record. I sometimes only slept a few hours multiple days in a row because I had spent the entire night edging until I found something disgusting enough to make me stop. In retrospect, it doesn't surprise me that I've been struggling for the last few months. Things aren't gonna improve themselves. I made hollow promises of changing to myself but I wasn't willing to really change *myself*. But in order to succeed, you have to. You have to change your lifestyle, your mindset etc.
A single decision without an actual change will usually not bring you far. 

Some of you may say I'm being dramatic, but this is how it is for me. Pmo is literally the only thing I ever was addicted to. Don't let people tell you pmo isn't a real problem. You know best how it influences you. Maybe it isn't a real problem to you. Maybe it is. You'd know, you don't need someone else to tell you. Never look back.

Don't let a relapse make you feel like nothing you do at this point matters. Every second you've even accomplished since your relapse matters. Thinking you might as well pmo after a relapse? There are always consequences, and by prolonging your relapse you are only making it worse. There's a difference between how you feel after the first relapse and how you feel after the second one.

I saw some of the most disgusting things while browsing the web for porn and even though I wasn't looking for them, it made me feel guilty. That guilt in turn made me want to distract myself from my past experiences which turned me back to pmo. It was a vicious cycle and time doesn't heal all wounds. I won't go into detail concerning the kinds of things I've watched, but it was pretty much everything you can imagine, as I compulsively wanted to assure myself that pmo wasn't the problem and that I simply had yet to find content that didn't make me feel like garbage.

It's not over yet. I literally relapsed 3 times and barely slept today, which was the final straw.

In the end, I guess I arrived at the same conclusion I did back when I started. That pmo cannot be part of my life.
I guess there's a second first time for everything.
Don't let other people tell you what's best for you. Don't give up on your ideals.

Back to going forward.

TL;DR: Basically a very long note to myself about my past NoFap journey and my future one. I'm glad if it helps some of you avoid making the mistakes I made.

2799,Question to NoFap,I think I might need some help here... Question about effeccts of abstinence,"So, I have some question because at the moment I am a bit confused, I will first ask my questions then I will go in to details of what my journey with no fapping has been so far so you don't have to read the whole post to know what this is about, I will be talking about an experience I had with a girl recently, I won't go in too deep details but if you are reading and are easily aroused keep this in mind. Also it's the first time I am in this sub, if I am too foul-mouthed let me know and I will edit the post/remove it.

I have not been masturbating or watching porn for roughly one month (26 days without any mistakes more on that later), I stopped because I felt way less pleasure when coming than usual and my erections where not that hard anymore.

Yesterday I have been with a girl she &gt;!blew me!&lt; but it was disappointing, it's not the first time and any other time it felt good if not great. I didn't time myself with a stopwatch of course but both me and her considered my performance on the disappointing side we blamed it on the fact it's a month I don't come (she knows I am abstaining, but she doesn't know why) but I don't know if this is really a thing, this never happened to me before so I don't know if it's related to not masturbating or not being with a girl for a while or something unrelated, so if anyone could give me some feedback on this it would be very apreciated. I am pretty sure I didn't came so fast because ""she was good"" &gt;!she in fact wasn't that good, she tried deepthroating me but the position we were in didn't allow for it to happen confortably!&lt;

The second question is, why didn't it feel good? Could this have to do with abstinance or is more likely the same problem from before i stopped masturbating? I don't know if I was fully erect, it was dark and I couldn't tell myself &gt;!but since it didn't fit all in her mounth I suppose it was at least somewhat hard!&lt;

Should I ask her to stop ""seeing"" each other to keep abstaining? it's the first time we ""see each other"" but she asked to see me againg and I highly doubt se will want to hold hands next time 

I hate people who ask this, because the answer generally speaking is yes but, should I talk about this with my doctor? My doctor is a family friend and while I don't have a problem talking to a doctor about this I have a problem talking to a family friend (the demonstration of this is that I am asking strangers on the internet instead of him)

I have been with the girl at around 6pm, this morning at about 7 am I woke up with a morning wood while half a sleep I came (without any imput from me) I didn't have full blown orgasm since by the time I was coming I woke up ad tried to limit the mess i was about to make, but still it was more enjoyable than the one I had with the girl from before. I have no idea what is up with that , last time this happened to me it was when I first hit puberty and I suppose at this point I am way past that phase

Is it bad if I stopped completely masturbating for an undetermined time? some people advocate the fact masturbating it's ealthy for the prostate

&amp;#x200B;

Here I go with my story so far:

I stopped masturbating in november as a joke, no nut november and stuff, I resisted one week then I tought to my self ""fuck it, why the hell wouldn't I masturbate for a fucking bet with my friends"" so I masturbated more than usual until the end of november.

(During this week it was kind of hard resisting also I was pre-cumming a lot during morning woods or with random boners)

After this week of abstinance as I said before I started masturbating more than usual, I suppose it was a combination of stress for exams, boredom and relapse form the first week of november, to limit myself a little I spent a lot of time at the library but at some point I had to go home and in the time I spent at home i could squeze in more sessions than usual. 

At the end of november I noticed I started feeling way less pleasure, if not close to 0 also my erection where not as hard as they used to be so I took the decision to stop masturbating for a while, I thought to myself that maybe I am more addicted than what i think, I decided on a month to see what happened but with the intention on going on until I could manage, this time I didn't have that many problems (I must admit i watched porn 2 times in the first week but I didn't masturbate and after that I manage to go on without any other mistakes). This is what I noticed so far:

Differently from the first attempt there was no unusual pre-cum and my desire was way lower.

I don't know if this is subconsciously related to not masturbating but I engaged in a relationship (quite early to call it a relationship but we are spending a lot of time togheter) with the girl I talked about before.

I have better looking skin, I don't know if it's the fact I am shaving a lot of more to prepare for dates, but it seems like I have better skin also where i don't shave (forehead, nose, high checkbone)

I am in a better mood than usual, (even before I engaged with the girl)

2874,Telling my Story,A letter to my fapping younger self:,"&amp;#x200B;

I think the reason why I was struggling with PMO addiction for years is that I was not identifying the cause for this compulsive behavior. I observed that whenever I am happy (in a sober sense), the desires are virtually non-existent. Because I am already contented with whatever is happening around me. Life is not perfect, but at least, I would be grateful for my health, parents, friends and most things in life.    
I tend to fap mostly in the after-math of anxiety. **Get ahead in life. Crave for recognition. Always worried about how to do better than my peers. -** These were my constant thoughts - consciously or subconsciously.   It became a vicious cycle. I am not saying that lack of ambition is good. I am not asking myself to settle for mediocrity.  All I am saying is that materialistic ambitions should be in moderation and I should learn to value other aspects of life as well. Pressing the gas too hard most probably leads to an accident, against its original purpose of reaching the destination quickly. Sometimes, not holding onto some things might be the way to happiness.   
Willpower combined with renunciation is the way to go.   
 I realized that one's happiness should not categorically depend on validation by others.

2876,Telling my Story,"Never bothered to create a journal, but really feel like it right now","Dear NoFap community,

Here i will post my journal, my road to become free of PMO. I never bothered posting anything on reddit but right now i really feel like sharing my toughts and feelings. I am going to give a honest review on NoFap, with the goal of 90 days. I started my streak on December 25 2018 and am still going. I am currently 18 years old and i've been addicted to PMO since i was 11. I started NoFap before without real intentions, i had a streak for 4 days but did not really take it seriously. Now i want to change that for good and give myself a better life.

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 1 -2**

Felt pretty good about NoFap, strong motivation, a few urges but nothing serious.

**Day 3-6**

These days felt like months to me, i couldn't quit thinking about PMO. But my motivation was strong and i resisted the urges. I was getting into new stuff like meditation and going outside to ride my bike. I was already feeling some benefits.

* High energy
* High productivity

But also disadvantages like,

* Bad concentration
* Mood swings
* Social anxiety, insecurity

**Day 7**

Day 7 was amazing for me. I woke up with morning wood for the first time in my life. I felt so powerful and confident. As i was filled with energy i wanted to start running. I ran for about 4KM that day and i felt pretty good (and exhausted aswell). Still doing my daily meditation routine and becoming really interested in classical music. I was feeling the so called NoFap superpowers. No toughts about PMO and no urges whatsoever. Really enjoyed NYE with my friends, the overall mood was great. We went out clubbing and i talked to a bunch of guys and girls alswell. Had a really great convo with a pretty cute girl but didn't bother trying anything. It was a really great day and it made me more motivated for NoFap.

* Super high energy
* Super high productivity
* Overall great mood
* Feeling really confident

**Day 8**

Day 8 felt refreshed today, since i quit alcohol and weed aswell i did not experience a hangover. Had a pretty intense dream about a girl im dating but nothing sexual. Woke up with morning wood again and it made me feel really good. The day started of good but in the afternoon i was experiencing an intense headache. It was like a needle sticking into my brain. It made me really unsure about keeping up with my streak but i was motivated and kept going. My mood was pretty weird. I did not feel happy nor sad. So apart from the headache i felt pretty okay. Productivity was good and set up a new goal list for 2019 (including nofap ofcourse).

**Day 9**

Had no morning wood today? As soon as i stepped out of bed i was feeling off. Im having the same headache in combination with intense nausea. Went out cycling just now and feeling a little bit better. Really questioning if NoFap is good for me and my health. Productivity is really bad, can't get anything done today and also my concentration is way off. And to top it all off im feeling really numb. Not happy nor sad. Started writing my journal to clear my mind, might help to let the headache and nausea go. As of now im feeling better and accepted these ""withdrawal symptoms"". It makes me want to keep going to see what the outcome will be and what i will become. I feel like im changing everyday and becoming a better version of myself. Im pretty excited for tomorrow!

* Medium energy
* Low productivity
* Really bad concentration
* Strange numb mood

**Day 10**

Today was a great day. I woke up with morning wood again. I started of with watching a video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQBxsf1st8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtQBxsf1st8) this really motivated me more to continue my journey. I also had a date today. It had me really pumped and i felt really confident and good. I just came back and it was awesome, she also told me she had a great day. I feel like im really making progress right now.

&amp;#x200B;

* High energy
* Medium Productivity
* Okay Concentration
* Great mood, real feelings
* Confident

2997,Journal Check-In,7th Day: Got Lots of New Energy,"Yesterday, I felt a bit tired the whole day and when I came home I laid on my bed and wanted to call it a night even though it was just 6pm. I was bored, a bit sad, and a bit pissed off, and usually this would be the point where I'd waste my entire evening fapping.

I didn't. After about 30-40 minutes, I said, fuck it, I'm gonna go to the gym! And I went. When I arrived, I realized I forgot my fucking gym bag at home!

Did I give up then? Fuck no! I drove back home (~15min drive) and got my bag and came back. Went to the locker room and started undressing, only to realize I forgot to pack my gym shoes! Clearly The Force was trying to prevent me from getting my workout, but I said FUCK NO! I left the bag in the gym, to ensure I come back, and I went home again and grabbed my shoes and came back.

Usually, I either burn 400 cals on elliptical OR do 20 minutes of all the weight machines. Yesterday, I was so determined, I did fucking BOTH for the first time ever. I came home at 9:40pm and just crashed into bed.

Today, I feel fantastic! I have so much energy that I haven't had in a while. Those who read [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ablca0/22_years_of_fapping_leaving_behind_a_destroyed/) know that I did nofap streaks before finding out about NoFap and the real reasons I felt like shit. Today, after 7 days of nofap, I feel as well as I did in the past after ~12-14 days. I think this shortening of the period before I feel better can be attributed to me not binging the last time I relapsed.

So if you do relapse, don't binge! And if you feel like shit and wish to relapse, hit the gym instead! :)

I try hard to make people laugh so they like me. I want to have friends. But i feel like im very passive aggressive and say mean things to them. Because i want them feel the same way i do...
So selfish i know. 

But what makes someone empty headed loser? A mindless loser? Narrow minded? Absent minded? Moronic? Stupid? Foolish? Dumb? How do i be a man? Do i have to be serious about everything? Or never serious? 

I feel like the worlds most piece of shit person. I feel so low and feel like others never ever value me and feel like they see me as inferior and naive and brainless guy with no personality.

I feel inane, ludicrous, daft, bonehead, witless, nonsensical.. shallow, useless, boring, dumb, dull, bland...

And i fap a lot. And i feel like i have to stop looking for approval of others. Might fix most things but there are a lot of things going on my head about whats wrong with me.

And always compare my self to the losers of movies. I find most annoying characters better than me.. i dont know how to have a personality, 

Most fictional characters are more interesting than me. I wanna be cool like indiana jones or batman or ironman or even hugh jackmans wolverine...

But all im rightnow is some weak, beta male, narrow minded, simple minded, boring, shallow, dull, worthless, meaningless, pointless, mean, doughbag... a guy who everyone thinks is invisible, a guy with no personality, a guy with no brain, a guy who no one values and no one cares about.. a guy who cant make friends or keep a conversation going for 5 minutes......

But I still failed to get out of bed quickly... ended up wasting time on YouTube on my phone until around 10:30. This really isn't good enough!

HOWEVER, got up, did my morning routine, fruit for breakfast and got a lot of work done towards my mission.

Then, unlike yesterday's carb-filled lunch, I ate clean again (quick thank-you to /u/ObviousQuality for the reminder).

Made a couple of 'difficult' phone calls... not really difficult, but my anxiety was showing up, and I think that's when the slip tried to happen again.

HOWEVER, I came on the NoFap reddit and hit the emergency motivation tool...

Watched an interesting TEDx talk about a guy who stopped watching porn, and why.

And then downloaded [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSGoJk-D1LQ), (recommended listening!) went to the gym and listened to it while working out.

On the way I bumped into someone I'm launching a joint venture with, so stopped for a quick chat... realised that I am making more real life connections now... the confidence *is* coming, even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes.

Returning home, urges gone, got a load of useful work done again.

It's interesting because I might have considered going to the gym to be a waste of time... but then I would have fapped and lost my *whole afternoon* to feeling like crap.

Instead I connected with people, got my exercise, AND got work done. I should remember this truth in the future. Work on myself is NOT wasting time.

3048,Motivation,Connect the dots,"Nofap success equates to boosting your self control. Addictions and predisposed to any addiction stems from your level to act based on impulsive behavior. If you’ve never been taught to resist or restrain your impulsive tendencies in any part of life, your brain receptors are programmed to trigger fire if sparked. I think this hits home for those that can’t sustain long lapses while on nofap. Instead of channeling energy towards behavior modification(no pmo) make it a broader attempt to address impulsiveness in your life. With the idea that you need to slow your reactions down and think before you act/react. Easier said than done, but it’s the root of my problems and I have shifted my focus on that now.

So, my second and third day was quite peaceful and chill.

During my second day (january 2nd), I helped my family clean the house (we had a party on the 1st of January), I also progressed in my book (La main de l'empreur by Olivier Gay). My brother gifted it to me during christmas. I also went out to buy myself a phone case for my new phone my mom gifted me.  I felt good during the whole day, but I was worried that other people made fun of me while I was out.

&amp;#x200B;

During my third day, today, I went out to help someone I know, who had trouble login into the PS Network in his PS4.

His mom made self-made Lasagna, it was good. I then proceeded to help his little brother with his homework, mostly maths and french, was easy. (he's still in elementary school). She told me that he needs help in german (or french, I don't remember which) and therefore asked me if I was available during saturdays to help him out. I don't go often out so I said yes. I then went back home and played some games on my PC. I also installed MS Visual studio, because I want to (or wanna? too urban language??) learn how to code in C++. During my trip outside, I was slightly less worried about what other people think of me, if I made any mistake or if I slipped into some frozen liquid and felt on my butt.

So day 2 and 3 was quite pleasant overall, no huge urge to PMO so that's nice.

3297,New to NoFap,Trying To Quit My Addiction Feels Like Using A Paper Umbrella In A Rain,"It's seriously driving me insane. I've tried quitting my PMO addiction and all that happened is relapse after relapse. It feels like I tried everything and I will go anywhere between 3-20 days and then it's back to incognito mode for me and lots of regrets later.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried going to sleep earlier, working out, reading more, getting a girlfriend - but I always end up relapsing. I know why I do it. It's a coping mechanism for me. When I get stressed at work or anywhere else I need a dopamine boost and fast. It used to be that I would play video games - which IMHO were a tiny bit better than PMO since at least there is some sort of challenge and you have to put in a little bit of effort - unlike porn where there is none.

&amp;#x200B;

When I am fighting my addiction I have to watch out for triggers (even simple words or names can make me think about some adult actress and the whole thing goes out the window.) I started this new year with the thought of finally killing my addiction and I actually believed that I had it. And then one hour ago I was back to square one.

So, I have a porn folder in my hard drive which I do not want to delete. However, now I have locked me out of all kinds of pornography and gave the passwords to a friend (that means I can’t even watch it on my phone). The friend is responsible to give the passwords at the end of the month, however as a failsafe I have taken a printout of the passwords and without looking at it, hiked to the top of a hill and buried it under the snow and soil and saved the gps coordinates. So, basically now I am porn free, except the only way I can watch it is to hike to the top of the hill, in freezing weather and dig the paper up, which I won’t and even if I decide to do so, I will no longer be in the mood halfway through the hike.

Screw this sexualized, evil world. Screw the devil. I am a new person now.

3351,Success Story,Finally! A girl that’s into me!,"Okay so I’m fully aware that this story sounds VERY fake but I know it’s real and I just want to share it. Okay so here it goes I’m going to tell you guys this crazy story that basically ends with me having no more terrible urges to masturbate all the time.

So I was at the mall with my friends. I had already masturbated twice that day. We were just hanging out at a table in the food court, some of us were eating but we were mostly just chilling and talking. There were ~6 of us by the way. My friend let’s call him Joe dared my other friend, let’s call him Mike, to go ask these two random girls that were sitting like 20 feet away from us to suck his dick. He was iffy on it but then, I was bored, and was like fuck it, I’ll do it.

I walk over to their table and sit down. I just say hi and ask them what their names were. Then I just blurted out “wanna suck my dick!?” They both looked at each other and then said no. I walked back to my table having failed a mission but I was ok with it. I was just happy to have had the confidence to go talk to them. Plus, my friends thought it was HILARIOUS that I actually asked them to suck my dick. But this wasn’t the end of it.

Later on, we walk by them again and just jokingly say, “I gotta ask 1 more time, WILL YOU SUCK MY DICK!?” my friends thought it was hilarious but that’s beside the point. They just asked me for my Snapchat, I gave it to them and then my friends and I walked away. 

Then about 15-20 minutes later, one of them Snapchats me and asks to meet up. She says they’ll suck my dick. I have a suspicion they were fucking with me but I wasn’t really doing much with my friends at the time so I go off alone and meet them. We just sat on a bench and they told me that they wanted to use my voice to make an ex boyfriend jealous. They wanted me to call him and say I was fucking both of them. He didn’t answer. I was disappointed but then my friends came (they must’ve followed me) and we were just sitting talking to the girls. One of them says they’ll make out with me. I’m like, ok let’s go. We walk around looking for a place to make out. Finally, we find a bathroom to do it in.

We go in and you know, don’t want to go into too many details but we started off with just like a peck and worked our way up to 2nd base. It was amazing. 

Okay so, for the whole week (I was on Christmas break) I only masturbated once. I had no more extreme urges and it felt great. I was so happy. Then she texts me and asks if I want to meet up again. I say yes, we go to the mall again about a week after the first time I met her. And guess what? SHE GAVE ME HEAD. It finally happened and now it’s been about a week and feel like I’m completely cured of my masturbation addiction. Like I said, I’m aware that this is pretty far fetched but it happened. I’m still amazed. My friends were SO impressed. My confidence is SOARING.

Tldr: asked a random girl to suck my dick, it eventually happened, no more masturbation addiction",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/accelg/finally_a_girl_thats_into_me/

3450,Motivation,Feeling the urge? Try this guided meditation.,"Here is an exercise I do when I get urges. Although I’ve only been a member of this community for a few days, I’ve been trying to beat my addiction for a year now. This won’t work for everyone, but if it works for even just 20 of you, I’ll call it a win. Hope it works for you. 


Next time you have an urge, personify that urge by envisioning a living form of that urge (I picture a beast or alien as the being since picturing a beautiful woman may not be the best idea for our goal here.

Now that you have your urge-being in your head, imagine yourself being in the same room as them. Maybe even sitting or standing next to them. Bring them as close to reality as possible-truly be with them. Pay attention to what is going on inside you. Fully feel how this being makes you feel. Do they give you butterflies? Do they give you guilt? No matter what the sensation, do the opposite of what your urge-being wants you to do. Sometimes I pretend I’m laughing at my being, sometimes I laugh with it. Sometimes I dance around it making fun of it, sometimes I even hug it in my mind. All of this is OK as long as you don’t do what it wants you to. 

Eventually, whether in 30 seconds or in 15 minutes, I’m done laughing at my urge-being. Once I’m done, I have no use for them. I literally wave goodbye as I picture it walking out my door so I can focus on something else. 

You are now free to do something better with your time. ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/acdedo/feeling_the_urge_try_this_guided_meditation/

The truth is after you hit day 90 - things get MUCH easier because it becomes a habit to not look at porn and jerk off. So I'm not saying hitting day 90 doesn't change anything. It does.

However, life has been difficult for me lately especially when I'm going through my quarter life crisis constantly questioning what I want out of life, feeling loss and feeling shitty. I can't help but get crazy urges because I feel so down. It's like my urges are convincing me that I could just peek &amp; fap to make myself feel better.

I know that's shit thinking but when it's so tough, I can't help but feel that way.

I know I'm at day 129 and it's kinda much more ahead of others &amp; I want to act as a role model but I guess even the ones who have a good track going are susceptible to urges and temptations.

So here I am coming open to you guys to give me the support &amp; encouragement that I have received when I started this journey to push on.

3589,Article,Is it really worth it? - EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT NO FAP,"Hello everyone,

On day 5 and already flatlining  :( so I thought I’d seek some inspiration and came across a really interesting answer on Quora about semen production. I’ll let you guys form your own opinions.

It’s a long read but totally worthy:

The vital energy, the Veerya that supports your life, which shines in your sparkling eyes, which beams in your shining cheeks, is a great treasure for you. Remember this point well. Veerya is the quintessence of blood. One drop of semen is manufactured out of forty drops of blood. Mark here how valuable this fluid is!

A tree draws the essence or Rasa from the earth. This essence is circulated throughout the tree, its twigs, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. The shining colours and life in the leaves, flowers and fruits are due to this Rasa. Similarly, the Veerya that is manufactured by the cells of the testes out of blood gives colour and vitality to the human body and its different organs.

According to Ayurveda, semen is the last Dhatu that is formed out of food. Out of food is manufactured chyle. Out of chyle comes blood. Out of blood comes flesh. Out of flesh comes fat. Out of fat comes bone. Out of bone comes marrow. Out of marrow comes semen. These are the Sapta Dhatus or the seven Dhatus that support this life and body. Mark here how precious is semen! It is the last essence. It is the Essence of essences. The Veerya comes out of the very marrow that lies concealed inside the bones. There are three divisions in each Dhatu. Semen nourishes the physical body, the heart and the intellect. Only that man who uses the physical body, the heart and the intellect can have perfect Brahmacharya. A wrestler who uses his physical body only, but keeps the intellect and the heart undeveloped, cannot expect to have full Brahmacharya. He can have Brahmacharya of the body only, but not of the mind and the heart. The semen that belongs to the heart and the mind will certainly flow out.

Semen is the quintessence of food or blood. One drop of semen in manufactured out of forty drops of blood according to modern medical science. According to Ayurveda, it is elaborated out of eighty drops of blood. The two testes or seeds that are located in the scrotal bag are called secretory glands. The cells of these testes have been endowed with the peculiar property of secreting semen from the blood. Just as bees collect honey in the honeycomb drop by drop, so also, the cells of the testes collect semen drop by drop from the blood. Then this fluid is taken by the two ducts or tubes to the vesiculae seminalis. Under excitement, it is thrown out by special ducts, called ejaculatory ducts, into the urethra where it is mixed with the prostatic juice.

Semen is found in a subtle state in all the cells of the body. Just as sugar is all pervading in the sugar cane, butter in milk, so also, semen is pervading the whole body. Just as the buttermilk is thin after the butter is removed, so also, semen is thinned by its wastage. The more the wastage of semen the more is the weakness.

In the Patanjali Yoga Sastras it is said:

Maranam Bindu Patanat,

Jivanam Bindu Rakshanat

Falling of semen brings death; preservation of semen gives life. Semen is the real vitality in men. It is the hidden treasure in man. It imparts Brahma-Tejas to the face and strength to the intellect.

SECRET OF HEALTH AND LONGEVITY

Without Brahmacharya, all your exercises are nothing. It is the master key for opening the realms of health and happiness. It is the corner stone of the edifice of bliss and unalloyed felicity. The preservation of semen is the secret of health and longevity, and of all success in the physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual planes. He who has even a little bit of Brahmacharya will tide over a crisis of any disease very easily. If it takes a month for an ordinary man for recovery, this man will be completely all right in a week.

The Srutis declare a full life or age of one hundred years for a man. This you can attain only by the establishment of Brahmacharya. There are instances of men who have attained longevity and intellectual powers despite their loose, immoral ways. But they would have been still more powerful and brilliant had they possessed a good character and continence as well. After Dhanvantari had taught all the details about Ayurveda to his disciples, they enquired about the keynote of this medical science. The Master replied, “I tell you that Brahmacharya is truly a precious jewel. It is the one most effective medicine-nectar indeed-which destroys diseases, decay and death.”

WET DREAM AND VOLUNTARY COPULATION-A VITAL DIFFERENCE

A sexual act shatters the nervous system. The whole nervous system is shaken or agitated during the act. There is excessive loss of energy. More energy is wasted during coition. But it is not so when emission occurs during the dreaming state. In a wet dream, it may be the outflow of the prostatic juice only. Even if there is loss of the vital fluid, there is not much draining. The actual essence does not come out during wet dreams. It is only the watery prostatic juice with a little semen that is discharged during nocturnal pollutions. When nocturnal emission takes place, the mind which was working in the inner astral body suddenly enters the physical body vehemently in an agitated condition. That is the reason why emission takes place suddenly.

The night discharge may not stimulate the sexual desire. But a voluntary copulation, in the case of a sincere aspirant is highly detrimental to his spiritual progress. The Samskara created by the act will be very deep; and it will intensify or strengthen the force of the previous Samskaras that are already imbedded in the subconscious mind and will stimulate the sexual desire. It will be like pouring ghee in the fire that is slowly getting extinguished. The task of obliterating this new Samskara will be an uphill work. You should completely give up copulation. This mind will try to delude you in a variety of ways by giving wrong counsel. Be on the alert. Do not hear its voice, but try to hear the voice of the conscience or the voice of the soul or the voice of discrimination.

A good lot of energy is wasted during copulation. Bad memory, premature old age, impotence, various sorts of eye diseases and various nervous diseases are attributable to the heavy loss of this vital fluid. It is greatly shocking indeed to see many of our youth walking with tottering steps, with pale, bloodless faces owing to loss of this vital fluid, instead of jumping hither and thither with agile, nimble steps with vigour and vitality like the squirrel. Some people are so passionate and weak that even the thought or sight or touch of a woman causes discharge of semen. Pitiable is their lot!

THE DISASTROUS EFFECTS OF SEXUAL INDULGENCE

The most devitalising and demoralizing of pleasures is the sex pleasure. Sensual enjoyment is attended with various defects. It is attended with various sorts of sins, pains, weaknesses, attachments, slave mentality, weak will, severe exertion and struggle, craving and mental restlessness. Worldly persons never come to their proper senses although they get severe knocks, kicks and blows from different corners. The strolling street dog never stops from visiting the houses even though it is pelted with stones every time. Eminent doctors of the West say that various kinds of diseases arise from the loss of semen, particularly in young age. There appear boils on the body, acne or eruptions on the face, blue lines around the eyes, absence of beard, sunken eyes, pale face with anaemia, loss of memory, loss of eye-sight, shortsightedness, discharge of semen along with urine, enlargement of the testes, pain in the testes, debility, drowsiness, laziness, gloominess, palpitation of the heart, dyspnoea or difficulty in breathing, phthisis, pain in the back, loins, head and joints, weak kidneys, passing urine in sleep, fickle-mindedness, lack of thinking power, bad dreams, wet dreams and restlessness of mind.

Mark carefully the evil after-effects that follow the loss of seminal energy! Persons are physically, mentally and morally debilitated by wasting the seminal power on so many occasions for nothing. The body and the mind refuse to work energetically. There is physical and mental lethargy. You experience much exhaustion and weakness. You will have to take recourse to drinking milk, to eating fruits and aphrodisiac confections, to make good the loss of energy. Remember that these things can never, never repair the loss completely. Once lost is lost forever. You will have to drag on a dreary, cheerless existence. Bodily and mental strength gets diminished day by day.

Those who have lost much of their Veerya become very irritable. Little things upset their minds. Those who have not observed the vow of celibacy become the slaves of anger, jealousy, laziness and fear. If you have not got your senses under control, you venture to do foolish acts, which even children will not dare to do.

He who has wasted the vital energy becomes easily irritable, loses his balance of mind and gets into a state of explosive fury for trifling things. When a man becomes furious, he behaves improperly. He does not know what he is exactly doing as he loses his power of reasoning and discrimination. He will do anything he likes. He will insult even his parents, Guru and respectable persons. It behooves, therefore, that the aspirant who is trying to develop good behaviour must preserve the vital energy. Preservation of this divine energy leads to the attainment of strong will power, good behaviour &amp; spiritual exaltation.

Excessive sexual intercourse drains the energy enormously. Young men do not realize the value of the vital fluid. They waste this dynamic energy by immoderate copulation. Their nerves are tickled much. They become intoxicated. What a serious blunder they commit! It is a crime that demands capital punishment.

When this energy is once wasted, it can never be recouped by any other means. It is the most powerful energy in the world. One sexual act shatters completely the brain and the nervous system. People foolishly imagine that they can recover the lost energy by taking milk, almonds and Makaradhvaja. This is a mistake. You must try your level best to preserve every drop although you are a married man. Self-realization is the goal.

The energy that is wasted during one sexual intercourse is tantamount to the energy that is spent in physical labour for ten days or the energy that is utilized in mental work for three days. Mark how precious is the vital fluid, semen! Do not waste this energy. Preserve it with great care. You will have wonderful vitality. When Veerya is not used, it is all transmuted into Ojas Sakti or spiritual energy and stored up in the brain. Western doctors know little of this salient point. Most of your ailments are due to excessive seminal wastage.

NOCTURNAL EMMISSION

By Dr. R. W. Bernard, Ph.D. (New York University)

A high-protein diet tends to produce sexual desire and nocturnal emissions by forming uric acid, which irritates the mucous lining of the prostatic urethra and also by producing intestinal putrefaction, generating poisons in the intestines which paralyze their peristaltic movements and cause constipation. Since the seminal vesicles, like the uterus, lie sandwiched in between the colon and bladder, constipation, involving a distended colon filled with hardened fecal matter, causes pressure on this organ and predisposes to emission, just as it predisposes to uterine discharges and painful and excessive menstruation.

In spite of their universality among the male sex, and contrary to popular and medical beliefs, nocturnal emissions are not natural physiological phenomena normal after puberty, nor do they provide a necessary release of semen when not discharged through voluntary sexual acts. A definite physiological mechanism exists for the lymphatic resorption of semen from the seminal vesicles where it is stored so that there is no physiological necessity for its periodic vicarious discharge through nocturnal emissions, which, instead, should be regarded as a morbid manifestation resulting from an excessive protein intake and representing a vicarious release of the albuminous end-products of protein metabolism beyond what the kidneys can handle.

Nocturnal emissions…indicate that the protein intake is excessive and that the kidneys are overworked. When protein intake is reduced to bodily requirements, there will be no need for the gonads to come to the aid of the kidneys and eliminate surplus nitrogenous matter in this way.

Dr. Deslandes states that the inflammatory condition of the urethra, which is responsible for nocturnal emissions, results from hyperacidity of the blood and urine. This means that foods which acidify the blood and which contain an excess of acid-forming elements tend to irritate the genital mucous membranes and predisposes toward such emissions, as well as to sexual manifestations in general. On the other hand, an alkaline diet low in protein has the opposite effect by neutralizing acids that tend to produce inflammation of the prostatic urethra. The chief alkaline-forming foods are vegetables, fruits and potatoes. Among grains, rice has been found to cause the least uric acid.

3597,New to NoFap,My first honest attempt,"Hi everyone  
I've been watching pornography since the age of fourteen (currently, I'm creeping up on twenty) and since the beginning, I've been at war with my urges.  
At my worst, I'd go at it seven times a day. My dick would literally fucking spasm and I'd ejaculate nothing sometimes. At about 15/16, I'd wholly realized that what I was doing was destructive, so I tried to quit. I tried to pull my friends into the fold too, and after some considerable effort, I was able.  
But I was never truly free. I'd fight like hell, go weeks, sometimes months, and then relapse.  
Lately, things have taken a turn for the worst.  
I've been relapsing. Not because I want to, or have an urge, or a specific thing that pulls me in, I simply do it to get it over with. I feel the initial ""rush"" and tell myself ""Fuck it, we've gotta do it so it'll be over with.""  
But I can't appease my drives. not at all. The more I do it, the worse it gets, the more I have to do it.

Few months ago, I deleted my porn folder and told myself I’m done with all this. It’s fucking up my life. I went without jerking off for like 3 days and I went straight back to porn and jerked off. I felt so ashamed and felt like a huge failure. It’s so fucking hard to stop. I just need some solid advice and tips to stop this addiction.

For the past 5 months ive been fapping essentially for the refractory period effects for sleep. Last night my sleep was terrible my shoulders hurt so bad i think i might have localized fibromyalgia or something its so bad not caving though. pain is trying to tell you something its not to be ignored or masked(generally) with meds or in my case fapping! perhaps 90 days is to ambitious for me, im going to try anyways.

I have never had a New Year resolution of any kind, ever. However, this last 31st December, for the first time ever, I decided something had to change to help me focus. After one last time (yes, it was that tough to let go), I decided that this year is when I'll mend my ways. I don't want to get into what got me into this, however, I could clearly see that after all that instant gratification, I was again back to feeling hollow inside

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure why I am posting here, maybe just to remind myself that I have taken a first step in the right direction, its been long due after-all. Maybe Ill come back to this post whenever I feel the temptation again, whenever I feel like a loser again and reassure myself that its all but a few moments of self control. I have succeeded 3 full days this year. Ill be done with 4 tomorrow and 5 day after. Whenever temptation strikes, maybe, Ill practice the new language I am learning, maybe Ill take a short walk, maybe Ill just count to 50, maybe Ill somehow overcome this addiction slowly

&amp;#x200B;

I am targeting 1 full month to start with and then build on it gradually. Just small steps towards a big goal. I still have a real fear that Ill go back to my old ways, *the fear is for real*. However, If I can take the first steps, am sure you can too. Please wish me luck!

Starting February 2018 I completed a 52 day streak, which was followed by a few 20 day streaks. Following that I completed a personal record of 73 days without pmo which went through the summer that year. Everything went downhill from then on. I could barely manage a 20 day streak, with constant relapses including today (04/01/2019) with an 8 day streak. I would like to say I have progressed over this period, especially during that summer as I incorporated habits such as working out and socialising while generally keeping myself busy. 

I promise to make 2019 even better than 2018. I want to become more confident. I want to excel in my academic studies. I want to improve my physical as well as mental state as much as possible. I want to become the best version of myself.

So... Really into my wife and it's quite difficult for me not to think about sex with her all the time so gets distracting and all that. I'd die of too much sex if I'd act on every desire so usually resorted to fapping, then after starting nofap to enduring sore blue balls. Until now. Took up meditation intensively to get a hang of it since on holidays.
We were napping and spooning, usually that's a guaranteed boner and blue balls 5 mins later - gave myself a challenge to apply shift of focus to my breath, posture and to relaxation same as when meditating. Bliss, no boner, no blue balls. No sadness, just full of calm self-control and good energy.

4068,Question to NoFap,Day 42- feeling strong urges,"A little about me:

I ve started watching porn since 17 and also involved in compulsive masturbation. I have sought novelty every time i watch porn and made me a porn addict.

I have abstained from porn several times but returned back. Masturbation was a constant act almost every day.

Nofap have made me realize how porn is an addiction. I have realized the following:
1) The more Novelty porn you seek you are increasingly becoming an addict.
2) you seek masturbation as an execuse to problems therby you are stuck in a cycle.
3) PMO causes PIED
4) you become less social and making less friends.
5) loneliness and pessimism are caused by porn also
6) less energetic

After realizing the above i’ve decided to switch my habits.

I have anstained from watching porn for 3 weeks cycles in august in 2017 until dec 2017. Spirtuality helped me.

From dec 2017 to march 2017 i had a 3 month streak not watching porn. I have stayed away from porn since then and have not even given a peek. It is more than 9 months since.

I feel i have increased my willpower and confidence doing this.

Motivated by the results i tried to stop the compulsive masturbation habit. I had 3 weeks streaks for 2 months. I tried the 90 day fap challenge and failed after 29 days due to a peer pressure visit to strip club. I have restrated and have successfully abstained from PMO then. I am currently on 42 days streak.

I have made several changes to my life . I started eating healthy, running, going to gym, prayer, waking up early etc.

THE THING THAT WORRIES ME THE MOST:

Altough i made several changes i still continue to have strong urges every day. I feel like my brain is building urge pressure and once i complete the no fap challenge it will burst and it will result in switching back to my old life style. Altough i am on the no fap challenge i cannot seem to stop thinking about urges. I ll need to divert my mind to stop thinking about these.

My take on the no fap challange is it is a feel good measure for porn addicts recovering and is not a cure or solution to the addiction problem. Thoughts on this? What is the solution to overcome urges",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/acl80g/day_42_feeling_strong_urges/

4079,Question to NoFap,Day 31: I feel I'll get tired of fighting the urges daily.,"Constantly thinking about not relapsing will lead you to relapse, I understand that now. I've got to 30 days for the first time in 5 years of trying (Alhamdulillah). I did this by investing myself in activities(gym, football, books, social clubs, religious practices) that have not only kept me distracted, but because they contribute to my vision, have had me engaged.

However, during this one month, in which I've kept myself very well distracted, I've still been at major risk of relapse: I've felt major urges 4-5 times which i fought away. There are some days when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to follow my routine and that's when i get hit by these urges. And they are soo strong it drives me crazy.

I don't want to go back to my old life. I'm enjoying all the benefits that are shared and it's transforming my life. When the urges hit me, i fight hard to resist and manage to win. But a scary thought bothers me. Will i always have the strength to fight these urges? Fight them until i get married(which means minimum 2 years till i get to be with a real woman)?

4174,Question to NoFap,How do i make friends and not being a loser? I dont know my self and i dont know how to stop this ass licking seeking approval.,"My depression makes me people dont care and dont value about me....

When with most people i dont know what to talk about, I worry about what to say next and most of times. I feel like i have to keep them entertained all the time. And make them laugh.. 

I want others to value me and care about me and chase me...
This started with wanting chicks to chase me online. And chase badly after getting rts and likes... so i would feel good...
I still dont know how to stop this..

It made me think my opinions dont matter and im invisible and no one thinks im alive.. and make me feel like i have no personality. I dont know why others are smarter than me or manlier than me or are better thinkers.. i dont know why some people are lower tooo..

It makes me feel cheap and light. Feel brainless. Narrow minded. Simple minded. Small minded. Wimpy. Always aggressive. Doughbag..

I feel like if i was a movie character i would probably the most unlikeable character of all..

Maybe i need real self improvement. But i dont know where to start...
When someone can do something i cant i get all crazy and compare them to my self and make obeservations about my self as worst as possible.

I dont know how to be a man. 

If someone is a man does that mean he is always right?? Someone like batman everyone thinks is cool. Same with spiderman or  wolverine or indiana jones... like whats differnent about them? What makes them unique?? And again how do i be a unique guy? Because i think im nothing now at all. 

When i see batman having no sense of humour i think about i have to be dark like him.. and so on.. sometimes i think jokes arent fine. So i dont know how to make friends anymore.

I feel like if i be a nice guys people and me will think im a wimp or a loser or a naive boring dull bland mindless brainless narrow minded unlikeable moron Who is trying to get others to like him by ""acting"" nice. Which is selfish af.

If i be mean people and i will see myself as a loser again and self proclaimed self narssisstic piece of crap and a ""everything about me"" guy.. 

I cant even keep a conversation going for 5 fucking minutes. Talked to snapchat girls for 3 years chased them all the time and begging for them to even be my friends.... thats how low iam.

Like i dont know what is right anymore.. is everything meaningless? What is the point of me? Why i am here? Like what makes someone the worst human being? How do i not be brainless??

4267,Telling my Story,I need Help.,"Hey guys, I don't want a pity party, I just needed to vent and maybe get some support.

&amp;#x200B;

I started masturbating when I was 5-6, this was before I had any technology, so it was either me thinking about the girls in class, or reading about or looking at the half naked women in the old almost uncensored Mens Health magazines. And truthfully I haven't gone more than 2 weeks without some form of PMO, since then. At that point my life wasn't too stressful, my parents had gotten divorced when I was three, and my dad did nothing but attempt to brainwash us(me and my older sister) with lies about my mom, and to my dad we were just trophies, or we were used to control my mom. If my mom tried to move to a different house, because rent was too high, my dad would threaten to get us taken away from her. My dad is also very prone to anger, and would spank us so often that when I got in trouble even at school I would start crying and covering my butt. I also was introduced to my stepdad when I was three, and he was the closest thing to a dad I had, but even he was always a little distant. I also got no support from my older sister who instead would take out all of her pent up anger on me, and as we were 3 years apart she was significantly bigger than I was, and would often bruise my arms, beat up, and insult me just to make herself feel better.

When I was 7, I got my first internet capable device. A 3rd gen, Ipod touch! After my dad gave me a stern lecture to my 7 year old self, on not watching porn or looking up inappropriate stuff, it was pretty much the first thing I did. Certian porn websites were my new best friends. and now rather than PMOing once or twice a week, it was everyday, or close to it. Of course I had friends at school and such, but I was barely allowed to hang out with friends due to my age, and aside from playing with legos, porn was my only stress relief, at this point I already had a pretty heavy addiction, that just got worse as the years progressed. In fourth grade I moved to a new and better school, and still no one but me knew about my PMOing except for me, however at this point I still didn't see a problem with what I was doing, and thought everything was completely fine and natural.  However at this point I started needing more and more, getting into different fetishes, and such, and then imagining the girls at my school in these situations, which now I know was an incredibly unhealthy thing for a 4th grader to do. These trends continued, even after I got my first girlfriend in the sixth grade, obviously we weren't going to do anything sexual, as we were 11-12, but I still had hopes. We dated for 2 and 1/2 years and eventually got more and more distant, until I broke up with her. Also at this point in time my dad had multiple CPS cases against him, but his rule in court is ""Whoever lies the most wins"" so noting had ever happened to him.

In the next year 8th grade, my sister, without talking to my mom or my dad, or her personal counselor. Said that my stepdad had been molesting her for years, and was a horrible person. My stepdad obviously said the claims were false, bu because my mom wanted to be a god mom, she kicked my stepdad out, until the situation was resolved. However as my sister was prone to lying, and refused to talk to my mom, whereas my stepdad was telling us all ""The Truth"" we didn't really have a choice on who to believe. My sister had also been caught smoking pot by him, so this seemed like a personal attack more than anything. Also, I probably wanted to believe him, as he was the closest thing to a father figure that I had, even if he was barely there for me as it was, he was more there for me than my dad ever has been. Throughout the next year I became more and more withdrawn, and I suffered with depression more and more, often coming very close to killing myself, but I didn't because I was the only person my mom had to rely on, and I also knew that I would likely have to support my little sister who had no clue why daddy couldn't come home, and still doesn't.

Freshman year, as I was becoming more withdrawn, I was trying to combat it by hanging out with my friends more, as well as trying to get with a girl I had been crushing on for the past year, and finally started hanging out with over the summer between 8th, and 9th grade. Because despite what was gong on, I still wanted to have a normal life, now I know that was impossible with my PMO addiction, which had been steadily getting worse and worse, because between a lack of empathy, due to PMO, and not having a healthy way to deal with stress. It was very hard to form strong connections. I also had an especially hard time forming connections with girls, because my dad had new girlfriends all the time, some of which would live with us more a year at a time, becoming part of my family, then would be gone the next week, without me getting to say goodbye, or anything resembling that. So subconsciously, I was used to girls leaving. Well, this was all well and good, we had D&amp;D nights, with my stepdad, where I would have the girl, and a couple of my friends, including another girl over, with my stepdad as the DM,  it was fun, but this was before incognito tabs, and she grabbed my phone to look something up, and didn't say anything, but I knew she had seen my recent searches, and shortly after this, she stopped talking to me, completely, and due to circumstances with her dads work, had to move. so Another relationship severed. I told myself it was just her being immature, as most guys I knew watched porn, but that was just denial to the the problem.

In Sophomore year, my sister older sister had graduated, gotten married, and moved to New Jersey, since she has been happily living her military life, while she left my mom picking up the pieces of a shattered life, still no knowing who to trust.  She wanted to believe my sister, however she still wouldn't give her any info, and when she still lived with us, she would yell and scream so much that my little sister started hiding under her bed. So, believing my stepdad was really the only viable option. because the case happened during the #me\_too movement, and because my sister was a teen, he had no chance of winning the case, so instead he pleaded guilty, which we all thought was the best option, as we didn't think he was guilty, during Christmastime, he went to prison, a temporary one, where the max sentence was a year, he got this through pleading for the help program. however that meant that we were going to have to pay for toiletries, clothes, etc. With just my moms income, and my dad refusing to pay child support, we had to move. Prior to my stepdad going to prison they were running a company, but it was too much work for my mom alone, so she found a job, and we moved in with one of her friends, who had 3 daughters, and 8 year old a 10, and an 18 year old. So I had to be very careful, when handling myself, no exposure, no anything. The 18 year old, had already gotten a guy for molestation when she was 16, dating the 21 year old dude. At this point I lived now 40 mins, from any of my friends, so we very rarely hung out, and this was when my PMO was the worst, my options were to go hang out with a bunch of unfamiliar, men hating girls, or be holed up in my room. So I spent all my time in my room. At worst I was PMOing 32 times a day, often multiple times an hour, pretty much thinking about and doing nothing else the whole day, in an attempt to stave off my suicidal depression. Of course in the end this did nothing for me except make me more depressed. However, it did make me realize that I had a big problem. So I started doing research, and I wanted to quit. However this was a fundamental part of me, I had a PMO addiction since I was 5-6, making it 10-11 years, and much of my mental development stages. I didn't and still don't have any other healthy ways to deal with stress.  Luckily we were able to get out of that house, and now live in a very low income apartment, in a high crime area. I've gotten suggestion, such as to exercise, just to deal with stress, without the people knowing about my PMO addiction. However I have hip problems, so at most I can walk around, the only real exercise I can do is lift weights, but I don't have money for a gym membership, and I also have bad wrist tendons. I know these sound like excuses, but I;m in pain pretty much 24/7, even laying in bed, it;s just a numbing constant pain.  I can't use counseling, because my dad would be able to review anything that I've said at any time.

But I need to be able to form relationships, outside of my close friends, who thankfully I've been able to hang out with more. I'm not able to talk normally to girls, or form new relationships with people. I go through the motions of it, but at the end of the day, what ends up happening is they know absolutely nothing about me, or they know what everybody knows about me, never an actual connection, so I lose the friends, or the bond. Not to mention with girls, if my some miracle I formed a healthy relationship, and got into bed, I don't think I could even get a hard on, because my brain is so fundamentally wired to porn. In addition to dealing with my PMO addiction, I also since discovered my stepdad was raising me out of guilt and because he liked the satisfaction of me looking up to him, and didn't actually care about me, he was cheating on my mom with other dudes, and that he got a blowjob and felt up my then 10 year old older sister, when my mom was pregnant with my little sister. So the father I thought I had, was actually just pretending to be my father, which is why he was always distant, and actually spent very little time with me. So I don't know what to do, my dad through all of this has done what he always done, and given me no support, when my sister was 16, she got a $300 allowance, along with insurance, and gas. whereas my dad said he'll pay half of my insurance, and when I work I'll pay the other half, despite already saving up for my own vehicle.  Originally our plan was to have him pay child support, which would pay for my insurance, but instead he got one more day of custody, completely disheveling, the schedule I've had since I was 3.

In essence I need help, I want to have normal relationships, but between my mind being controlled by PMO, and all the other stress and BS with my family. It just seems, I don't even know how to live normally anymore, no-one I know has gone through anything like this, it's not like he died or something that would be simpler. Now we have to deal with all these pieces, like what do we eventually tell my little sister. And no matter how hard I try, I've only been able to go a week and a half without PMO. So if anybody has any advice, or words of encouragement, please. Because I don't really know what to do. All I can ever seem to focus on is everything wrong, even when it gets better, like last week I got my license, but I don't feel any different. Nothing seems to ever change...",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/acntff/i_need_help/

4317,Relapse Report,Relapse,"Ok so I relapsed last night and I was very Disappointed. However I'm asking myself what ""triggered"" me into doing it. Well to answer that I did see a movie (it was really good!) But it had half naked women in it plus I had sugar in my system so it kept me awake  and looked at girls on Instagram prior to the movies. but I was out with the boys sooo yeah..
But recently I've unfollowed girls on social media, Started drinking water, doing small exercises and about to Start intermittent fasting again. With that said LET'S DO THIS!!!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aco9wj/relapse/
4333,Relapse Report,42 days gone in 10 seconds.,"First things first. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE A BATH OR SHOWER WHEN YOU'RE HORNY OR HAVING URGES, UNLESS YOU ARE GOING ALL COLD. You will go in thinking you wont relapse and you may not but mind over matter. Your mind always wins.

Second! DO NOT KICK YOUR SELF IN THE ASS FOR RELAPSING. It happens. It happened. It's done. Now start over and have a good mind set. You have a bad mind set you will fail again and again. Trust me. Please. 

Third! When I relapsed today I knew I wanted to. I literally wanted to masturbate. I was extremely horny. I wanted to fuck so bad that I was going crazy. I controlled my self took a deep breath and said fuck it. I knew what I was doing. It wasn't in the back of my mind like normal. I didn't suppress my thought and urges. I just went for it. To be honest I went to a porn video and just sat there with my hand on my dick. I didnt stroke or anything. I blew the biggest fucking load I've ever seen. Shit was insane. Kinda cool actually. BUT! THATS NOT A REASON TO RELAPSE AGAIN. 

If you want to relapse then you need to have the mind set of ""if I do this, can I get back on track the next day?"" ""Can I continue without destroying my progress?"" The answer is YES! You can and will. If you are just relapsing out of boredom then take a cold fucking shower. 

When I tell you that the literal 10 seconds of excitement and pleasure I experienced was not at all great, I'm DEAD SERIOUS. I didn't feel good about it. However, I was relieved. I had a weight lifted off my shoulders. That's where people get stuck in the relapse cycle again. They think they can lift that feeling off their shoulder every time. Unfortunately thats not how it works. It's what leads to unhealthy problems again. 

After I relapsed I got out of the tub and almost fell down because the rush. I felt like i was going to vomit. I stumbled to the shower and turned the cold shower on and sat for a few minutes to relieve the rush. I got out and didnt even dry off. I went back the other bathroom and sprayed magnesium oil all over me so I could level out the hormones again. I'm still a little shakey but I feel better already. I also took a zinc tablet to replenish the nutrients lost from ejactulation. 

I will not beat my self up over this. I've done amazing. 42 days is a long time, but not enough. It's not even close to where I want to be. Tomorrow i will wake up and continue doing my thing. I won't dwell on what happened yesterday (speaking from the future.)

4451,New to NoFap,Just Getting Started...,"This is my first post here (first post ever on Reddit, actually)... I figured I've been a lurker for too long, so I'm hopping on board and committing to posting on here regularly as I start this new chapter of my battle with PMO.

It's been almost 14 years since I first looked at sexually explicit content online, and since that day it's been a constant battle for me to stay pure and abstain from looking at pornography online.  All through high school and university, it was the daily thorn in my side... I found myself falling into the same cycles over and over, quitting and relapsing, looking for sexual gratification any way I could get it, and always falling into the same pits of despair and shame.  Even looking back now, it's incredible to me how much of my life I can contextualize by my struggles with PMO.  It has been such a core component of my life that it has defined so many of my years up to this point. 

As I start 2019, I'm looking forward to so much... This is the year I will finish grad school, begin a career, and marry the love of my life.  Reflecting on my struggles with PMO over the New Year break has made me realize how desperately I want to leave this addiction in the past as I turn the page forward to so many wonderful moments ahead of me.  I long to be the best fiance, husband, and eventually father I can possible be, and I know PMO will only hold me back from being that man.  I know this isn't a religious sub by any means, but as a Christian, I can't even imagine the spiritual blessing and relief I would get by leaving this nasty vice in the past and being able to grow in my faith without these chains holding me down.  PMO has done nothing but tear me down, and I'm at a point now where I just want to be done with it for good.

NoFap has motivated and helped me over the years, but I've never really dived in and tried to take an active part... I plan on changing that and hopefully encouraging others to keep up the fight while you all encourage me to keep going strong.  By posting a few times a week, I hope I can keep myself accountable to you all and keep some sort of record of how I closed the door on PMO and entered a new stage of my life with a renewed purpose and strength.  It's time to get to work and break through like I haven't before.

4538,Advice to NoFap,A relapse happens much before an actual relapse - Some advice,"As we already know, NoFap isn't just about not watching porn or not masturbating, it's about completely changing your lifestyle. It's about taking up new courses, taking up exercising, gym, a sport, a new hobby; it's about becoming a different person.

My observation has been that when your lifestyle has changed, it becomes very difficult for your addicted brain to directly force you into relapsing. On the other hand, what I have noticed is, the addicted brain first talks you into breaking your new lifestyle, breaking your new habits, after which the urges become very powerful.

In my example, I had taken up a resolution that I would not have tea as often, I would not eat any junk whatsoever, and I would jog. Yesterday due to some commitment, I couldn't go for my daily jogging, and since my lunch wasn't very fulfilling, my brain convinced me to have some junk food. After which I kind of lost control, I had a lot of tea, I had more junk, and then eventually later in the day, I relapsed.

So my advice to NoFap is, do not lose the small battles. ""Hey just a packet of chips won't hurt"" is not just a simple battle, it's actually a gateway battle, it makes the addicted brain win the war more easily. Do not regress away from your new found lifestyle, you may end up in trouble.

That's all I have to say, so have a great day people! Thanks for the read, and I hope this helps :)",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/acq4s2/a_relapse_happens_much_before_an_actual_relapse/

4627,Motivation,Best benefits of Nofap(for me),"Sleep-I only need to sleep 6 maybe 7 hours to feel fully rested.
Confidence-better posture and more eye contact

Motivation-stopped smoking weed, been going to the gym for a while, have way better grades, more friends as well
Brain fog is gone. I can finally hold a conversation without forgetting what I wanted to say
Skin is much cleaner, no acne, and better hair overall

Didn’t feel like listing ever benefit but you get the gist. 

Nofap isn’t by any means a tool that will get rid of all of your problems. Nofap gives you the extra helping hand. If your mindset going into Nofap is to relax and stop jerking off, then you’re setting yourself up for failure and you won’t get anywhere. Ask yourself why you are doing Nofap and don’t lie to yourself. In order to better ourselves, we need to be true to ourselves. Fuck whatever anyone else thinks and become the person you always wanted to be!

4640,Motivation,Benefits I’ve seen on no fap,"Was watching porn at maybe 15, 29 now, found out about no fap a couple years ago, struggling with it ever since, wish like hell I’d found out sooner I just thought feeling like shit and anxiety and brain fog was normal... Benefits I’ve seen in no particular order:

-less social anxiety, used to have crazy social anxiety and disfunctional thoughts no fap definitely improves this I feel like I’m living in the moment more, I talk to people a hell of s lot easier, my thoughts are quicker, I’m funnier, I can talk to girls easier, I don’t feel so awkward  out of place in social situations

-my sleep patterns, used to stay up all night with racing thoughts and wake up to racing thoughts, it took me forever to go to bed and when I woke up I was up. This always left me tired and miserable. Now I fall asleep easy, I take naps during the day, if I wake up I can fall back asleep.

-more energy, might go along with the sleep thing, but I can go to sleep at 1 and wake up at 6 and feel well rested 

-way way way less brain fog, I never ever realized what the pmo was doing to me until I got off it. I love being able to think clearly, it’s like night and day

-motivation, I think it motivates you to clean up other areas of your life, like clean my apartment more, work out more, eat healthier

-confidence, I am much more confident on no fap, I can see myself going up to random girls and talking to them, I don’t walk around with my head to the floor all the time

No fap changed my life, I’m still struggling but I hope I can kick these bad habits and live a better life for good.

4649,Telling my Story,PMO Induced Dry Eyes,"I think dry eyes is one if the most obvious symptoms of PMO for me. It still took me a while to figure it out though.

When I was in college I ended up going to multiple eye doctors for it. They prescribed various drops but nothing helped. I could barely keep my eyes open at times they hurt so bad. I thought I might have to drop out of school it became so bad. 

I had not made the connection between my PMO and dry eyes back then. My dry eyes made me shun almost every activity except for PMO. So I began to do that even more frequently. It was a viscous cycle.

Now that I’m aware of the relationship, whenever I feel my dry eye issue getting bad I know to simply cut back on PMO. If I start to do PMO multiple times a day, it’s a guarantee that I get bad dry eyes within a few days. If go a week or longer without PMO, then I never have dry eyes.

Back when I was seeing an eye doctor for this condition, they recommended I take omega-3 supplements. Apparently this helps with dry eyes. It actually did seem to help more than anything else (except quitting PMO). I’ve since researched and discovered that ejaculate contains omega-3s. So this is possibly related to me depleting my omega-3 supplies.

Due to my dry eye condition, I’ve always been consciously trying to cut back on PMO. My New Years resolution this year was to quit completely. I think, at a minimum, my eyes will thank me.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/acqtuk/pmo_induced_dry_eyes/

And stick with the program. 100% it's a great thing. But if you want to get Stacy and find some real human interaction (which we all crave) then it's not enough. You have to make a conscious effort to better yourself, physically, mentally and emotionally. It sucks and it hurts a ton but you can do it. It only takes an hour a day. And if you push yourself to the limit each time then you'll reaching your goals. It may take a while but you can do it.  
Idk. Just a thought. Go out and kick some ass

 Edit: I apologize for my unsorted thoughts it's been one of those weeks.
My point is that not fapping isnt enough. You also need to take the time in the library, in the gym, and in your heart to improve yourself. Its cool if you can go a thousand days without fapping. But if you're still playing video games or whatever and aren't taking the time and sweat and tears to improve yourself mentally, physically, and emotionally then it doesnt really matter.

I knew for a while that NoFap resulted in a better me but I never really had an incentive to improve. But recently my sadness was just too much, and I realized I became apathetic, lethargic, cynical, indifferent, and over all just plain unhappy. So I hit the gym again and work out until I can’t move. I’m glad to say that I have made it this far, even though it’s not much. But lately, I haven’t been able to sleep well at all. Usually after intense workouts, I’m knocked out. But that was before NoFap so my energy is more but even when I slam the gym and do homework and go straight to bed feeling tired, I just can’t sleep. I don’t know if this is a problem unrelated to NoFap or not. Not being able to sleep just causes me to feel urges and that’s when it’s hardest (no pun intended). And when I do pass out, I barely get enough sleep.

After the drill had ended, the girls gave me back my jackets and referred to me as their savior and, while looking for my roommates, I noticed my crush with her kitten in her arms (that lives in her dorm now).

4883,Advice to NoFap,Avoid Catastrophizing a Relapse,"Avoid catastrophizing a relapse!

Due to the pain of a dopamine deficit, there will be a point where even the most disciplined newbie nofaper will relapse. 

If this happens, the key is to not fall into what psychologists call catastrophizing, or thinking the worst. 

Just because you relapsed, don’t tell yourself, “Okay I’ll r/nofap tomorrow, 3 days, next week...”

This kind of thinking will mean repeated cheats/relapses until you get back on track. 

Forgive yourself for the mistake and then get back on your goal.

But this lead to an MO, which was so sensitive it was only 5 strokes. What the fuck. I punched my bed a bunch of times and then I prayed to god to help me on a new journey

But what I can take from this is, I need to think better. 

Within these 42 days, I’ve probably peeked enough times that I should have reset my counter tbh, and it put back my progress a lot . I put down the fact that I was hurting myself looking at p subs a lot as well. 

So much for no nut nineteen, how about no fap forever though?

I hereby claim That I shall no longer 

-Masturbate 
-watch any form of porn
-double check P-subs on All forms of social media 
-fantasize about sex 
-sext 
-artificially orgasm in a way that isn’t intercourse 

I’m shutting it all out 

This was my longest journey, but I think I’m ready to embark on this new one.

Unfortunateley, I feel really anxious, tired, and I can feel some brain fog, everything I didn’t want going back to school in 2 days, but, that’s life

4992,Advice to NoFap,How to deal with urges?,"This is a technique I use often when I get unbearable and strong urges during my ""LIFE WITHOUT PMO"".

You can try this if you want.

Take a pen and paper.
Find a peaceful spot where you will not disturbed by any one else.
Switch off your smartphone and computer and put them away from you.
Just you, pen and paper.

Start writing down whatever is coming to your mind. Don’t mind the grammer or sentence completion. Just flush all your thoughts at that moment out in to the paper.

Once you finish that:

1) Start writing what all benefit will u get from giving up the NoFap journey now?
2) Write down the benefits and pleasure you will get from it (even though for a few minutes)
3) Then what are the bad consequences you will suffer if you give up your NoFap journey

Write everything in detail. Take some time.

Finally,
I hope when you have done all this, you will be better.
If not, after all this, then meditate.

I hope this helps.
Do not worry. We are all with you.
You will have a great future.
You will get the right girl for you.
You will live a happy life.

5027,Motivation,"I’m doing this again,and I want you guys to br here every step of the way","I’m still young, a 15 year old with an addiction to masturbation and a mild addiction to porn, and recently, I lost my longest streak ever to my urges at 3 in the morning, trust me, the morning hours are lethal for thoughts

I’ve noticed a pattern over time, each time I try this, every time I attempt this kinda thing, I get progressively better 

2 days 
5 days 
A week 
14 days 
15 days 
42 days (my latest one)

This is a process, it’s a process that gets better as time goes on, 

after I MOed a few times, I got mad and frustrated, but afterwards, I feel confident to do this again, realizing how far I came, and not all hope is lost.  I’m fine now, and I actually just ignored an urge while typing a minute ago, I got my ways

But I saw so many benefits that I hope I get back to being stable, such as 

Increased motivation 
Reduced stress 
Reduced anxiety 
Less depressing thoughts 
Better skin 
Eyes seem more awake than they did 
RBF isn’t as frequent now. 
I’m able to enjoy the smaller things in life 

Rn I feel motivated that I can get these back to their regular state again and make everything even better, but it’s gonna take time.

I think the one thing that’s going to cause your downfall, is the fact that you are constantly looking at your time, like 4 hours before I relapsed, I had 1000 hours clean, but because of that, I lost a portion of my progress. 

There’s a lot that I am going to fix, just realize that you shouldn’t take nofap lightly, it’s a progress that takes a lot of determination and will power. 

I probably won’t do daily check ins, maybe weekly, and if I get to a far point, probably monthly, but yeah.

5082,Motivation,Waking up after a day without PMO is 1000x better than the morning you wake up after a night of PMO! [Thoughts on change for 2019],"I have been so wasteful over the holiday period. I had a poor sleep routine and convinced myself that PMO was something that I needed to help me sleep. I relapsed every few days. 

I completed two 90+ day resets last year. I think that once you are reset, your brain can tell the difference more acutely between the benefits of staying clear of PMO, and how crap it is to indulge in PMO. NoFap is not the same for me as it was during the first 90 day streak, but it is no less valuable.

I do now want to recommit. I want to watch a self improvement video, including some about NoFap, at least once a day. I want to endure a bad nights sleep instead of falling into PMO, if that’s what it takes.

There is a school of through in this community that NoFap should not be an end in itself. That focusing on this sub and other related materials all the time is a waste of time. However, I am so susceptible to PMO and suffering relapses that I think I need to fill my mind with the reasons for and the ‘science’ behind NoFap more regularly, in order to make sure that replaces useless thoughts and urges that lead to me relapsing. I think each individual needs to find their own path. 

So, I hope 2019 is a good year for everyone. All I can hope for is more progress! Peace out ✌🏻",45,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/acufla/waking_up_after_a_day_without_pmo_is_1000x_better/
5087,Telling my Story,"I do not know where else to post this, but my mother died last night from chronic alcoholism.","Here's the story:

 

Before I got home from school with my sister to help her downstairs, she probably consumed an excess of alcohol either intentionally or unintentionally (that's only assumed because the liver failure was acute). When we got home she was delirious and trying to go downstairs but couldn't due to a severely bruised leg and just her weight (she was 300lb). We helped her back upstairs where she insulted us, told us my sister and I were trying to hurt her. Then my other sister arrived and called paramedics which measured her blood pressure to be 60/30 or something near there. She was brought to the hospital, where her heart stopped, so she was then mercy-flighted to a more equipped hospital. Her heart stopped again (they were doing CPR, this was the second time), and when they put an oxygen tube down her throat which worked at first, and then they diagnosed her with acute liver failure and kidney failure, along with a heightened ammonia presence in blood and acidic blood which they helped and are helping that with kidney dialysis, which they said she'd be on for days or weeks (normal amt of time for that is 4 hours tops). That's when her body no longer accepted the oxygen tube and that leads us to now, where pneumonia is building up in her lungs and the doctors said they *won't* do CPR once more.

Feel like no one values or cares about me. Makes me feel moronic, dumb, foolish, brainless, narrow minded, simple minded wimpy beta male nice guy. Thats how i feel.

I try to make people laugh a lot. And try to please them to be my friends but they dont.. 

I want people to chase me like in Twitter i tried day and night to get girls to reply to me and try to get followrs and trying to get 10 likes or rts.. but i hardly could ever make it.

Made me feel meaningless pointless and brainless absent minded guy.

I dont know what to say in a conversation.
I never have anythiny to say. I get stuck and hit my self when i get home.. or when online talking to girls i get mad when i get one word replies everytime...

Im mad at my self for not having unique opinions or belifies to share.. if i tried to build a good story it would be the worst story ever...

I always do the same shit... i used to play football now i barely play.

I used to be nice guy now im the mean guy... i try so hard to be cool like batman or indiana jones or Robert Dwayne Jr or wolverine or most other fictional characters.

Im the mean asshole... i feel like i dont have a personality. I feel inferior and feel cheap and low and vulgar and..

I feel like if i was in a movie i would be that character no one cares about. And he is mean to others so now others dont even care to hate him.

I dont want people to see me as naive or dumb wimpy nice guy beta male..
I dont know how to be assertive..
I dont know who i am. I dont know how to find who i wanna be.. 

Maybe im the mean guy because i just ignore reality. And want people feel the same way i do.. pretty selfish of me i know. 

I dont know how to be a man. I dont know how to stop this. Maybe by stop fapping and self improvement? 
What makes someone not be all of those i described? How do i be smart and have a cool manly personality not an annoying or weak or dumb or moronic one?

5177,Motivation,What Happens When You Try to Reboot?,"It was not hours or days or weeks or months, it was years we have been exposed to the porn stuffs. It means that our brain has got rewired in such a way that it always craves for more porn if we try to stop it getting its meals. It’s threshold has got substantially high due to the constant exposure to porn in the past. Porn is even present in our thoughts. That’s the extent we are addicted to it

So what happens when you try to reboot?
What happens when you stop the brain giving the food it was getting for years?

Brain will react, obviously. It will react very furiously. It will persuade us to porn.

“When you remove a source of pleasure from the brain, it is like taking away the leg of a table. The whole thing becomes rocky and unstable. The brain really has two options: one, to make you hurt like hell in every way it can think of to ‘encourage’ you to put the table leg back again, or two, to accept that the table leg is really gone, and figure out how to re-balance without it. Of course, it tries Option One first. Then, after a while, it starts to get to work on Option Two, all while still pushing Option One in the meantime. Eventually, it seems like the brain re-balances, giving up on Option One, and fully succeeding at Option Two.”

Now, let us look closely at how brain do the first way of asking you to put the table leg back again.
That’s the most interesting part. Our brain is a very intelligent and peculiar organ. It doesn’t ask us to do PMO all of a sudden.

Instead, it will make us think something like this: “Relapse is not so bad, man. It’s just one time. You have been abstaining from it this long. That too on hard mode. A single video clip won’t make me that bad. it’s just 5 minute video. You can come back after you have done it asap.”

It slowly slowly persuade us to the pit.

This is the exact thought process our brain executes to get its meals. And sooner or later we give up and finally relapsed.

The moment after we ejaculate and came to the sense, we feel the regret.

“Oh, shit shit, what have I done? Why did I relapse now? It was just 3 days from my goal.”

The part of the brain which executed the porn favourable thoughts are resting now after getting its meal.

This is the way it works.

So who should you blame for your relapse?
Your brain???

Never.
Brain is YOURS. It will work as per your wish. You are the master of your brain. I tell you again, IT IS YOU WHO IS THE MASTER, NOT YOUR BRAIN. IT IS YOU WHO SHOULD CONTROL THE BRAIN, NOT VICE VERSA.
Tell this to yourself everyday multiple times. Make it a habit. Multiple occasions. Write it down in your journal every day multiple times.

The most important step in controlling the urges is recognizing that your brain is controlling and cheating you at the time of urge

And when ever an urge hits you,
First, realise that your brain is asking for its meal.
Second, you try to affirm that you are the MASTER and you have to control.
Third, take the the journal you wrote before and start reading it.

All these will help you reroute the urges to some where else and tell your brain that your goal is something entirely different now.

Peace

But for some reason recently it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I literally threw away some of the best times/moments of my life because of porn, mainly through PIED. It's unbelievably sad that I will never get this time back. I'll never get a chance to relive those moments. Could have had numerous girlfriends, flings, etc. that never worked out because of my broken dick.

Porn is so absolutely disgusting that I will stay as far away from that lifestyle as possible. Not only am I giving up porn but im changing the person that I am. I will be disciplined, dedicated, responsible. Its not just about giving up porn, its giving up everything that comes with it as well

5260,Advice to NoFap,The best Scientific adivce for PMO,"PMO is a habit controlled by the subconscious mind (which doesn't know good from bad all it knows is habits) .. So in order to stop it you need to dig deep and find out the pattern of your PMO

You need to record all the details of your PMO..  like is there a designated place where it happens.. Whether its a particular time of the day.. Or is it a state of mind or emotion (like bored or anxious) that makes you do it.... Keeping a track of it would make you know the cycle of the habits. The Cue or the trigger.. The routine or the place and the reward which is the dopamin hit that your body gives to yourself..

After you do it... All you need to do is tweak it ever so slightly that the entire montage falls down.. Avoid the place where it happens.. Be aware of the emotion that precedes it.. And thus you'll be Able to change the routine.. And also the habit itself..ans lastly...PMO is a strong habit with a heavy dopaine hit... And to replace that you'll need something that has the same or higher dopamin level.. Which can be achieved by rigorous  workout or meditation... Do this and you'll break free from the cycles of PMO FOREVER #Cheers",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/acwa3q/the_best_scientific_adivce_for_pmo/

Then when I left I went to a store a got a some sweets. Ate them on my way home. I believe I did that because I was feeling depressed the last few days.

When I got home I started eating whatever I found in the fridge. After I was stuffed I felt really tired and snoozed a bit. After I woke up I was groggy and couldn't make my self get out of bed. I was a lazy, stuffed, depressed fuck. I got something that resembled to a boner while a picture that I saw in the morning on Instagram was going around my head, it just got stuck there. I had no plans, no idea what I'm going to do. I live alone and there's nobody to stop me.

I started wanking and the erection wasn't that good so I got my phone and started browsing for images. I relapsed. Took a shower while feeling like shit, I think I'm getting a cold too. Then when I got out the shower I started wanking again and this time I turned on my PC. I felt like a miserable piece of shit the whole time. Of course I browsed a lot of NSFW crap on there and came again. Now I feel even worse.

There, there's my full confession. I am manning up and not feeling sorry for myself!

I'm gonna go to the pharmacy, get something for the cold and then read a book! I am not going to use my phone, nor will I binge watch goddamn Netflix!

I'll probably visit this sub later again. It's 7:15 PM and I usually go to bed at 11 PM.

I might watch Netflix before sleep though, because that's what gets me really sleepy. I want to quit that too, but I'm working on it. I've quit gaming completely and I'm trying to cut one thing at a time.

Thank you so much for reading. If you have any supporting words or advice I'd love to hear it.

If there's anyone that got this far and wants an accountability partner that will check up on each other daily for at least 90 days I'm in! I want to beat this, but I know I can't do it alone and I don't really have any real life support.

I have maybe one close friend and one close family member. None of them can't really take this as serious as I need someone to take me. This shit is ruining my life from the shadows, like a demon following me, lurking and striking at my weakest. I need a friend that would help and and whom I can also provide support and help.

Anyways, hope you are doing alright and keep on going. There's no other way than forward!",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/acwmc6/no_goals_boredom_depression_overeating_relapse/

But I just couldn’t get it off my mind for some reason. I managed to get it off my mind for a good hour and I went to bed. Woke up it was still there so I gotta out of bed ate breakfast and it was still there. I went to my room I found the girls Instagram again and I just looked through all her posts but in back of my mind Ik what I was doing. I already knew I was gonna edge I had made that up in my mind so I went to google looked up more pictures of her and my heart beat started getting really fast I was getting really aroused more than I use too and boom I nutted but just a little I was able to control it.

5353,Motivation,"The more one masturbates, the more one craves release...","You'd think fapping to get rid of the urges would stop the cravings but it only makes them worse (at least for me). Your body will just want more. I've fapped twice a day for a couple days recently, making the morning urges extremely difficult to overcome. If you're on a streak, don't throw it all away and make it harder for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

My highest streak was 18 days. I gave into the blue balls. However, it was much easier to keep that streak going, up until the 18th day, than it is now to not touch myself for even one day!

&amp;#x200B;

You may think you're satisfying the urges but you're only making them stronger. Your body craves the dopamine from touching yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Just get through one day, proving to yourself you can, and the urges might start to get a little less each day. One day is an achievement for people in our situation. You would have gained a glimpse at a better life!

&amp;#x200B;

Also, keep busy in the mornings. The morning urges are the worse. Once you get going, the rest of the day doesn't feel that bad.

5383,Emergency - Help!,I need help from all of you. I'm desperated. 3 years and I'm in the same dark hole,"Well guys, I dunno what to do so I will be grateful to you if you can spend some time on me and give me some clarity:

The general situation in my home is a disaster. I live with my parents. I'm 21. My dad was infidel to my mum for a lot of time. Due to some circumstances, my mum couldn't divorce. I knew this since I am 13 yo, so I always dreamt with making my mum free from such a psychopath (my ""dad""). I couldn't get a job in all this time although I looked for it so I'm studying for a job in sanitary area ... 


I felt it (to release my mum) like a duty, and year after year, I saw I couldn't, and I couldn't, and I couldn't, and I think that made my self esteem decrease and decrease, and one day I met porn, and  in February I will make 3 years trying to do NoFap... 1 single week was the most I did, the rest was day yes, day no,3 days free, 3 days fapping, very irregular...


When I read the reasons to not to fap (mind fog, feeling bad,etc...) I'm agree with them because I feel them, but I don't really feel inside myself a reason what stops me when I have an urge, and I want to stop this forever. That single week I stopped because I found how dishonest I was with the people I love, but 7 days later a bad event happened in my life and I fapped again as a reliever because of my apathy... 3 years later, I continue with the same apathy... In those 7 days I felt powerful enough to defeat urges, now I can't... 

So I dunno what to do...pfff
I tried meditation, sport, cold shower, etc... but my low self esteem made me do it just for a couples of weeks as much...
Do I need to increase my self esteem? How? 
Do you think that I need to be better to have more self esteem or having more self esteem I will reach my goal?

In my dream Porn was already opened in front of me.I tried to resist the urge but I failed.  I did the fapping process unwillingly. I was in my room. When I cum( I know it sounds disgusting when you read it) there were nowhere or anything to cum on. So I cummed on the floor. When the ejaculation finished I was so ruined for broking my streak.Again I was failed. Then there I see the floor.I tried to clean it with my pants I think.Poor me. Then this is when it happened. Lights get on and there were my dad,mom and sister.They looked at me and say nothing.They were disgusted. They turned back and left to room. I started to cry. When I got the hall my dad was leaving the house.I was crying really bad, my hands were shaking,sobbing.I tried to say something to my dad but no words came from my mouth.I went to kitchen my mom and sister didn't even look at me. I wanted to be in a dream so all of this would't be real. I could get of this pain and shame. But it was real.

5561,Journal Check-In,Day 7 of 90: Lessons Learned,"I started my journey last week, and I have learned a couple of things so far: 

•**Making yourself busy helps keep your mind off of the addiction**

I am taking two intersession classes at my university, the only two classes left that I need in order to graduate. They are 2 regular courses packed into 20 days (I had to get special permission from my university to overload my intercession schedule due to the intensity of each class), so I have plenty of work to do and no time to procrastinate.

•**Social Media does not help keep your mind off of the addiction**

I woke up this morning to find that I had a follower request from a girl I knew in high school. I looked through her feed on Instagram to see what she was up to nowadays only to find that her profile was full of sexy/revealing photos. I found myself in my old toxic mindset (the kind you get when you see internet boobies), and immediate closed out of Instagram. I then got up to go do laundry.

•**I have a little bit more self control**

I am more inclined to finish my school work and to not procrastinate, more than I have been in the past throughout my college career. I guess it’s better to learn this now than never, especially before having to go out into the real world to get a job and pay off loans.

5636,Journal Check-In,Serious Report from Me (3 Days In),"January 2nd is the last time I fapped. So far things are going alright, but definitely not as good as my 9 day streak in early December. I'm sick right now actually. 

I know a lot of NoFappers who do it because they have a problem with talking or hanging out with women, I have a different problem. I can have a relationship, but they werent very strong because either I was too horny or they didn't care about me. Usually a combination of both. I have a bullying problem in school, NoFap wont help that (actually it gives them more reasons to make fun of me), and they used to get girls to talk to me just for the heck of it and then make fun of me even though they did the same as I. It was really deteriorating, even though they fap daily they are more social than me. Maybe its just my circumstances, how my father died when I was 11 and then my last grandparent in a tragic way 2 years ago. 

It really broke me but I'm not having a pity party here. The reason I'm writing this is because I could care less about a relationship right now, I'm almost 18 I'd rather improve myself, taking care of my mom &amp; sister than worry about those women at this point in my life. They don't care anyways I'd rather find someone that suits me. I'll be sure to update as I break past my streak and hopefully quit fapping for all eternity.

5658,Success Story,"1,000 days, my experience and last post.","As you can tell from the title I started nofap as a scrawny 110 pound kid, in the 1,000 days since I’ve put on 30 pounds and have truly become a man this is how.

Step 1 - it’s all in the mind, you need to will yourself with everything to become better.
 
Step 2 - a relapse is not a reason to give up or binge, a relapse should be lighting the flame inside you to become better.

Step 3 - figure out your triggers, if you relapse after looking at a girls Instagram consistently then either unfollow the page with risky content or delete the app entirely.

Step 4 - nofap is not this one thing that is gonna change everything in your life. YOU need to change your life. Some of you may disagree but I recommend taking the red pill.

Step 5 - don’t believe everything you read on this sub 90% is anecdotal evidence and the other is 5% real science that gets repeated over and over and over with an extra 5% of bro science sprinkled in.

Step 6 -  mentality shapes the man, if your mindset is constantly just “don’t fap don’t fap” then most likely you won’t get near feeling the benefits

That was the hard part these are the rewards I got for my efforts.

Reward 1 - got my first girlfriend. A girl I had been crushing on for years became close with me and after a few weeks became my girlfriend, 9 months still going strong. (I don’t believe it was nofap that attracted her to me)

Reward 2 - this is more a reward from working out but nofap is what got me to the gym in the first place, I put on 30 pounds most of which is muscle, this significantly helped with the ladies.

Reward 3 - a ton more respect in my social group and every day life, I am now looked to as a leader and someone who makes decisions.

Reward 4 - significantly better looking, before nofap I had a shit quiff, acne and was very skinny but now I’ve got very decent hair, no acne and as I’ve mentioned I’m a lot more muscular.

Reward 5 - female attention. This is the big one the one guys come here and pray for, personally I have experienced this, I’ve had girls older than me flirting with me and even girls who had previously shown a dislike to me coming on to me and flirting.

But that said just like the rest of this sub it’s anecdotal evidence but it’s all I got.

This will be my last post on nofap, I may occasionally lurk but no more posts for at least another 1,000 days. 

The reason I’m leaving is that nofap has become a lifestyle for me now and I see no benefits in staying here. I’d like to thank the creator of this sub, the mods and the fellow fapstronauts ( although I’ve always hated that name) for giving me the knowledge and motivation to drive my life in the direction I wanted.

It is my hope that this post helps some newer people to this sub.

5704,Telling my Story,Story time people,"Alright! 

Not sure about the shorthand here so ima just use PMO for everything, just guess it’s probably correct 

Been doing PMO since I was 9, started with basic shit, then went to advanced evil, many problems 

Y’all know the story.

I am 17 now. 

I have been talking to a girl for 3 years 
We have been dating for 4 months 

Had a phone call 3 weeks ago where I told her I had something to tell her about my dad and about me. But not yet

So yesterday we were in the mall, cause ya know teenagers 

She told me some hard personal stuff, about her family 

So I told her about the phone call thing, that my dad was a cheating bastard. I don’t like my father Incase you could not tell.  This included how I found out

I found out because I saw PMO stuff on his phone, which lead me to be  snoopy shithead found all his PMO , and I found an email account with him and some lady from work 

So my dads a *many many swear words* 

But then she was scared, because I told her the to things were connected (my dads thing, and my personal problem) so she thought I could be cheating

I was and am not 

So I told her about my PMO addiction 

Once a day for the past 7 ish years, only recently trying to escape

When I was young I did not know how bad it was 

When I knew how bad it was I was already trapped 

Now it’s been down to once/twice/three times a week, with a few large gaps 

But I am still very much addicted

I told her all this. She was disappointed and confused because this is the first major problem that I have brought up with her 

I have a very close relationship with her and her mom 

So she told her mom and her mom was also disappointed but it was not a relationship ender

We are still together and we will survive as a couple 

But! I want to share with whoever reads this something important that my girlfriend told me

I can’t quit PMO because of her, my intentions have to be correct

I can’t quit only because of her because if she leaves then I lose my only reason for stoping and just fall back into the same trap

She wants me to be a strong man with or without her

But definitely a strong man without her

I have to beat PMO because I know it’s wrong. I know I am addicted, I know it’s a problem and I want to better myself.

I don’t know how religion is accepted here but that is a major part of it too

I have to fix my self and free my self from PMO because it’s wrong in the eyes of god and it makes me weak as a man 

Stoping for my girlfriend is just extra motivation. 

What do y’all think about this? If anyone reads it 

I’ll update y’all as I go, this happened today and yesterday 

I installed 2 PMO blockers on my phone
Told my mom 
And plan to talk to her mom sometime in the near future 

Pray for me if y’all do that 

Thanks. 
Ksocks.

Is it wise to whack it once every week?

5725,Telling my Story,Am I addicted? Tell me r/NoFap," 

(Before we begin, I made this account just for this, so if you check it don't be surprised)

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, r/NoFap. I don’t really know how to start this, so I’m just going straight to the point. I’m here to ask you all what I should do: go for NoFap, or keep living my normal life. I assume most you will be biased to this question and your answer will obviously be “Go for it! It’ll be great for you!”, but besides that, I’d like to hear the reasons why, and not just something that’s copied out of a list of benefits of NoFap. But, in order for you to answer my question, you need to know a bit about me. 

So, I’m a 19 years old virgin (I’ve had a girlfriend before and we dated for almost a year, but she wanted to wait and I didn’t want to pressure her into having sex and we eventually broke up) and I’ve been watching porn for about 7/8 years and have, since then, masturbated almost daily, depending on how my life was at the time, sometimes even more than once a day (almost always, if I’m staying home all day). I still do it to this day and to be honest I think I want to get rid of this “addiction”. Right now I’m on break from college so I have a lot of spare time and I don’t want to spend my days masturbating away in my room. I’ve actually been thinking about all this for a long time and I’ve even written a few things about it just to see where I stood in the midst of all this porn and this confusion, but my problem is that I never get to a real conclusion. I keep questioning myself “Am I really addicted?”. This seems to me to be clear addiction talk, but, for some reason, I keep getting stuck on it because, for about 3 years or so, I’ve considered myself to be a rather sexual person (this seems a bit weird, considering I’m still a virgin, but yeah). I don’t consider myself a sexual person because I love watching porn or jerking off, but because I find everything about sex very interesting and I love to talk about it with friends and discuss it and what not. My fear is that with NoFap I’ll eventually lose that part of me. And, to be honest, I don’t know how I’d take that.

Something that I see many people claiming to be side-effects of porn is liking prettier and prettier girls (like those seen in porn: massive tits and ass, beautiful face and nothing like a regular girl), PIED and selfishness in sexual situations. I’d like to develop these a bit so you can also give me feedback on that.

Starting with the liking porn-like girls situation, I’m not sure how this applies to me, because I don’t really like the typical pornstar looking girls and I actually find regular girls to be very pretty and hot when they’re “my style” (I like girls with curves and girls that look average and I’m not the biggest fan of the skinny-type girls or the girls that are outstandingly beautiful for everyone). So, I guess I wasn’t very affected by this, but at the same time, I’m not sure. What do you think?

With PIED, I’m also not sure where I stand, but I think I’ve had instances of it coming up. Not too recently, but over the last year or so, I’ve had a few times where although I’d “rise to the occasion”, I wouldn’t do it fully, so I’d basically have a semi or like a 75%, 80% boner. But this only happened while watching porn. When I was with my ex, PIED, or ED in general, wasn’t a problem for me. This was actually something I took notice but didn’t really act upon it. I thought that it might've happened just because I was getting distracted those times. But, now that I’m writing this it does feel like signs of early PIED.

When it comes to selfishness in bed, although I’m a virgin, I’ve done things. Not much, but a bit. And from the bit that I've experienced, I can say that selfishness isn’t really a problem for me, because the girl enjoying herself is what ultimately makes me enjoy myself. (I’ll spare details on this topic, because, well, I’m not wanting to give too much of myself, even though I’m literally talking about my masturbation habits).

Just to end it, I've tried NoFap a few times in the past but never really got into it for real. This past week, I actually tried to go a few days without fapping just to see what it'd be like. I did it for 2 days and then got bored of it because I was not doing it for real. The day I ""relapsed"" was today, and that's why I'm here.

So, r/NoFap, what should I do? Try NoFap and why? If I shouldn’t change anything, then why? ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ad07in/am_i_addicted_tell_me_rnofap/

5768,Advice to NoFap,Get some sleep!,"Hey y'all, 

I'm currently reading ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker and stumbled upon something which may be of help to our nofap journeys.

On page 149, 2nd line, it reads: ""Insufficient sleep also determines relapse rates in numerous addiction disorders, associated with reward cravings that are unmetered, lacking control from the rational head office of the brain's prefrontal cortex."" 

In other words, get a full night of sleep (\~8 hours) consistently and it may very well become easier for you to overcome urges, and eventually PMO as a whole.

I hope this is of some use to y'all, and definitely recommend this book if you're interested in this sort of stuff.

I think maybe the real problem with addictions is that it’s a THING that makes us happy, which by extension shows us that we as addicts search for THINGS to make us happy.

5906,Telling my Story,My Introduction and Why I Started NoFap,"Hello. I am a young man. I started chronically masturbating at a very young age (age 3-4). As I grew up, I always sat at home, masturbated, and missed out on important events. It’s painful to look back and remember. I was even late to my first full-time job ever because I was masturbating. It became a large problem in my life. I woke up one morning and told myself, “no more!” Guess what? I haven’t masturbated since November! Sometimes I get the urge and it’s so bad, and in those cases I’ll either watch porn BUT not touch myself, or I’ll go to the bathroom and urinate (this helps a lot!). I’ve trained myself to watch porn and to see the woman as a person rather than a sex object. It makes me feel sad for them, and then I’m no longer aroused. My voice is getting deeper and I find that women look at me more often. I’m still to nervous to talk to them though. 😔 

I’m really looking forward to meeting new people in the community, and hope we can share and exchange our tips and tricks. 😊",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ad1c9o/my_introduction_and_why_i_started_nofap/

I expected to feel like a depressed sack of shit for a few days, but no, I got up, helped around the house, helped with shopping, everything, and it’s only getting better, I’m not even a full day in what I hope to be my longest streak ever.

I’m only 15, so I feel like the reason I feel ok is because my body is still developing and it’s getting more and more used to abstaining from PMO, but still.

I don’t want to feel that anger and guilt again, I’m no where near a violent person, but after relapsing, I was furious, but I didn’t beat myself up for it.

6108,Confession,Ordination Song,"""I always knew you  
In your mothers arms

I have an idea  
Placed in your mind  


To be a better man  
I've made a crown for you  
Put it in your room""

&amp;#x200B;

I've struggled with nofap for a couple years, and only now am I starting to experience my longest streaks. For a while, I thought I would never make it out. I thought I would spend the rest of my days as a functioning porno-holic.

Initially, nofap felt to me like a quest, something that required brute force and will. Self-improvement was a matter of hungry masculinity, a jealousy turned fuel for the fires of reform.""No pain, no gain"". I gritted my teeth and grimaced as I paced around the room between sets of pull-ups I did to stave off cravings.

And this would work for a while but never more than a week. Inevitably, I would slip back into old habits. This whole nofap struggle felt like an acting gig, and I am not a method actor (nor any sort of actor really). The Sylvester Stallone persona couldn't last because it just wasn't me nor what I wanted to be. This societal mold of manhood and strength never fit me before my addiction to porn, so why would it be a part of my recovery?

This manly conception of nofap has worked for many successful former-fappers, so I don't want to discourage anyone who is making progress with it, but I wonder about what narratives can work for the rest of us. I've found that I am strongest in fighting this addiction not during sweaty workout sessions or late nights wrestling with urges but instead in more sensitive moments of beauty. I find strength in conversation and art that reawaken in me deep and intricate emotions that have eluded my porn-tippling brain.

Many fapstronauts see nofap as conquering addiction with a phallic sword. Instead, I conceive of my liberation from porn as a heavenly coronation as described in the song. For me, nofap is about just as much about achieving triumph as it is about reclaiming the mundane and quiet beauty of life itself.  ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ad2dm9/ordination_song/
6118,Motivation,Don't be Afraid to go Crazy!,"I am a major porn addict. I've been trying to quit since 5 years. It's fucked up. I've never made it past 10 days.

I have no friends, zero social skills, extreme awkwardness, the list goes on. In fact, I can actually notice some physical disparity between me and others of my age. I think pmo has messed with my development. It's that bad.

However, sometimes I get a huge, untamed rush of progressive energy. I relapsed last night, and instead of the usual disgusting, depressing, suicidal mood that I usually enter, I just didn't care. I was like, fuck it. Who gives a shit. Whatever. I don't care anymore! I went crazy! It was insane!

Today, I have felt more energized than ever before. It's as if all the resentment, all the self hatred, all the failure had collapsed into itself and manifested into a brutal release of untamed energy. I feel so free, so careless. This time I WILL make it. This isn't just a statement, it's THE TRUTH.

I haven't masturbated since December 27th, and I'm pretty good at avoiding it, but for some reason looking at porn-like things is one of my substitutes. A lot unhealthier than my new exercises, sadly.  That said, not masturbating has already helped me tremendously, so I think cutting off porn FOR GOOD this time will be even better.

Less than a year ago, I started my first real NoFap journey. I didn’t start watching porn/viewing half naked girls until around 65 days, however I didn’t masturbate until around 80-85 days. I literally blue-balled myself for like 20 days 😂😂. After finally caving, I honestly wrote a whole essay on how disappointed in myself I am, in hopes that I would start fresh after that. However, the damage was already done. I started making excuses, and I eventually made masturbation part of my daily schedule. 

Now fast forward like 6 months to this week. I look at the tv, and I see a headline talking about how India is like the fastest growing country viewing sites like Pornhub (I’m not Indian btw). I also see a story talking about the rape of a woman that was filmed by the offender, with the audio of it being played on the news. This was where I was done. 

In one quick action, I deleted my huge porn stash on my phone, and rejoined the NoFap subreddit, also disabling all NSFW posts. I think it’s been like a week since I started NoFap, but at this point I’m really not interested in counting my days as it gives me a sense that I might quit in the future once a certain amount of days pass. 

Basically, I’m just glad I have started my journey again. An extra motivation for me is how I haven’t masturbated once in 2019, which really helps me when the urges come strong.

I’m only 19 years old, and have probably been fapping/watching porn for 8ish years opposed to some the others who deal with ED. 

What I’ve been noticing in the last couple months or so whenever I relapse is that I haven’t been getting as hard as I used to. Since I think I’m kind of catching the ED problem in the early stages I was thinking I could fix it by never letting it really start.

Right now I’m closer than I have ever been to actually getting a girlfriend. I don’t have any intention on having sex with anyone any time soon, but when the time comes I’m wondering if my ED will get better? ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ad477a/is_ed_permanent/

It wasn't until i was 19 that my interest in women took an all time low. I knew i was still attracted to women, but i could no longer find them arousing in real life. Every time i watched a P video with just decent looking women in it, i would get hard in an instant. But when i look at beautiful women in real life, i dont get hard or horny at all. About 5 months ago i attempted to have sex with this beautiful 10/10 girl, but sadly couldn't get horny enough to get an erection. After a little over a month of no P and few streaks of no MO, i was finally able to get an erection and have sex with her. But i still find it difficult at times to get aroused/horney. I have been MO alot lately. I have stayed away from P for about a month now. I started my NoFap journey just yesterday and im still clean from doing any PMO. But i need to know if anybody has ever been in my shoes. If so, about how long did it take you to fully recover from this and find real life women arousing again?

6520,New to NoFap,Day 0: It starts today! Committing to stop this habit that puts me into a treacherous cycle of self doubt.,"I've started fapping ever since I discovered self pleasure at the age of 11 or 12, currently 26. For the past decade and half, I've been consistently self-pleasuring with online porn videos consistently (sometimes up to multiple times per day). Internet porn is my worst enemy, I always fall into the habit of accessing porn sites whenever I'm in front of the computer alone at home (and in recent years, using the smartphone as well).  I've always liked computers, been exposed to it since I was 10 (with no Internet), and then my household had broadband connection when I was 13 (fapping really ramped up when I had Internet access). I went on to study computer science at college and now 90% of my job is being in front of a computer. I face the computer for at least 5 hours every single day, and with the ease of access to online porn videos, I always find a chance to masturbate when I'm alone at home. 

I've lost self control in so many other aspects of my life with this negative habit, I consciously know that this habit is not bringing me any good, 90% of the time I just cannot help it.

Before every session, I would lose control of my behavior and stop what I was focusing on like trying to read or write, and then I would ponder about controlling the urge for maybe half hour and the I would give in to it and start opening the incognito window. Every time I masturbate, I waste precious time that could've been used to enjoy a good movie, to cook, to write, to work, to learn, to lift weights, and of course to sleep. 

I'd like to think that my health isn't very much affected by this behavior because I lift weights most of the time, run, and swim occasionally. But, in the other side of my mind, I constantly have this thought ""If I stop masturbating as often as I do (average 5 times per week over the past 5 years), I might be able to lift more weights, run and swim further.""

Hell I might even get more work done, earn better wages, be a better friend, be a better boyfriend. 

Speaking of dating, I have a girlfriend for 2 years now, we rent a small room together in the capital city as we both originated from different states, we have sex occasionally, it was always great sex. I stopped masturbating the first few weeks we started dating and having sex. However, the urge to masturbate never went away for long, no matter how much sex I have, I will still find time to masturbate. There were times where I would have sex 3 times in a day with my girlfriend and I would find myself in the bathroom masturbating to porn when she's asleep. I know this is fucking disgusting, that's why I'm writing this to commit myself to stop this habit.

Another bad habit that I had was smoking weed, while I was 23-24 years old, I would smoke weed every single day before sleeping and that jacked up my masturbation even more, the feeling of orgasm was enhanced with the weed. 

How I really know that I am god damn addicted to masturbation more than anything else in the world is that even after I've stopped smoking weed for almost a year now, I still masturbate like an animal.

On the outside, I've always been a shy guy that works hard at the office, that tries to achieve a little more of anything in whatever I do, but on the inside, I feel like a loser masturbating to porn every single chance I get. I'm going to be 26 this year, and I've just realized that I've spent almost 1/3 of my life masturbating to porn. I have to stop doing it. I have stumbled on to this NoFap movement for a couple of years now, and I now fully acknowledge that this is officially an addiction.

6679,Journal Check-In,Day 6 Hard Mode (26 M),"Thank you for taking the time to read this and be a part of my journey into health and wellness. 
I decided to not masturbate this year. Hard mode is my only option as my wife is not on the same sexual frequency as me. Porn has been a huge issue for me in the past, but now that I only use erotic literatureI am focused more on the masturbation compulsion. My goal for this year is to re normalize the hormones in my head I have thrown out of Wonk by masturbating like my life depended on it. Moving from videos/pictures towards erotic literature has helped a lot, and even though this shift represents a sea change for me it is still leaving me feel like an insecure little boy. That is why I am just not going to masturbate for a year. I am hoping that I can spark some long term change in my marriage, especially our bedroom, if I get myself mentally, emotionally, and physically happy. My wife does know about this journey, although I wouldn’t say she is supportive. I think she is scared I will just be pestering her to fulfill my sexual desires. I just wanted to write this out and get it into the world, because it seems like writing something into existence empowers the idea. Thank you for reading.

6749,Advice to NoFap,Think twice,"Whenever you might be tempted to relapse just because media is almost filled with nudity and eye-catching scenes that would make you think about it, remember for whom you are doing it.

Sometimes we don't realize how dehumanized we could get after watching porn or masturbating, your feelings disappear and your numbness hurts everyone around you. They will still be around you because of love but if you love them give them back love and there's no better way than loving yourself and taking care of any actions and decisions that you take, not only about fap but in everything in your life.

6908,Motivate Me,is it true that excessive Masturbation creates less lubricants and my knee bone crackles upon squats,"Yes I read that on one quora answer just after having one session ( I'm a bit dizzy and pissed off of myself) But I just feel that I have damaged a lot to my body because I have lost so much of hair from the top central part and even taking those **Ayurvedi medicines** which is giving me skin boiling all over my body and not affecting that much

6925,Motivation,Why it's so hard to stop.,"For me, the hardest thing about trying to stop is, there's just not enough of a consequence of jacking off. 

The only consequences for me are feeling a little tired, feeling a little guilty or sorry for myself, and feeling a little weak mentally (knowing that I can't fight my urge).

And that's it...
It's just not enough to make me go, ""nope, I'm doing something else, not gonna jack off"".

When I weigh the consequences with the benefits, the benefits seem to outweigh, but the benefits only last for a short time.

What I need is a reason to motivate me to not do it, like if I knew I'd go blind or I'd get cancer, I'd stop..

6997,Telling my Story,A partial success story from someone who was a virgin prior to getting PIED and a request for advice,"Hello [/r/nofap](https://old.reddit.com/r/nofap), and welcome to my throwaway account's telling of some stuff I've been going through the past few months. There's a TLDR if you don't want my personal story and the question I want an answer to.

My backstory: I'm a 22 year old male who, prior to August of 2018, only ever seriously dated one person. I was bicurious since sixth grade and the fact that I was attracted to both sexes had essentially paralyzed my interest in dating; I couldn't process the fact that I was bi until much later in life. I had one girlfriend in highschool briefly before calling it off (and breaking her heart, which I still feel like complete shit for doing).

Early June of 2018 I had fully processed that I was bi and figured now would be a decent time to try to get into shape so I can maybe explore my urges. Going from a complete string bean with zero muscle to a person who is in decent shape and (now) has abs is an amazing feeling. With my gained muscle, I had noticed that when I masturbated, I had higher stamina. Out of nowhere one day I noticed that I was lasting longer than before so out of curiosity I decided to test my limits. I had more stamina and energy to fap more frequently and longer. So I proceeded to fap daily, sometimes multiple times a day. I thought it was perfectly natural for a man to masturbate (which it is for the most part just not nearly to this extent). For anyone curious, I was mostly into straight/lesbian porn that never got too crazy (imo) but every now and then I would dabble in gay porn, which was able to get me off. But I unwillingly became addicted to it. I would try to sneak in a fap before work, before going out on a date, late at night when everyone was asleep. Whenever I was alone I had felt compulsed to do it. I hadn't thought anything of it when I was going through this, which in hindsight is scary. I had always masturbated every now and then when I got the chance, but I want to say this multiple times a day business started sometime July/August.

Cut to the end of August of 2018 and I finally made a bumble and a tinder. I wasn't looking for a hookup, mainly just some dating experience under my belt and to explore my urges. I (foolishly) started with looking for women first. I had figured looking for men would of been a bit easier at the time (spoiler: it is and I recommend any men in a similar position to go after men first) but it was daunting. So for about a month I was swiping, matching, making conversations, etc. until eventually I find an old high school crush on tinder (we'll call her ""A""). I swipe because why not, and whoa, it was a match! I was delighted and proceeded to message her. We caught up a little and organized a first date. The first date goes well, we ended up cuddling in a movie theater (I know cheesy first date idea but whatever) and I felt sparks. Second date, we were talking and realized that we had both had a crush on eachother at some point in highschool! I had also came out to her as bicurious (and she came out as bi too!) and we ended that date with a kiss.

Cue third date and I initiated some more, one thing led to another and we found ourselves making out at the end of the night. I'll admit we were moving a bit quickly but she allowed me to get to second and third base that night, and I managed to get her to orgasm (after a bit of work and figuring some stuff out). She tried to reciprocate, but that's where the red flag came up: I couldn't get fully erect. Now, I'll admit that while A wasn't exactly my type from a physical/chemistry perspective, she was still a pretty, kind, trustworthy woman who I respect immensely and would not of minded doing stuff with prior to my PIED. That night I was able to get it up a little but not fully erect. I had masturbated prior to our meetup and I tried to accredit that with the issue getting up. I was nervous she would say something but thankfully she didn't, and she stopped early on because she realized we would have nowhere for me to ejaculate without making a mess (thank goodness).

Fourth meetup and we want to try sex. It was November 1st, and I hadn't masturbated at all prior to that night. She tries to get me up again to similar meager success. I try putting on a condom but it doesn't go in properly. I try inserting and it just won't work. The awkwardness of the situation (doing it in a car) and nervousness definitely didn't help. So ultimately I try to blame the fact that the condom wasn't a good fit for me (which it honestly wasn't) for the reason why my boner died, and proceeded to eat her out.

I get home and I'm devastated. She said it was ok but I knew something was up. I had a crush on this woman before. When we reunited we had genuine sparks. I had never had sex/my penis touched by anyone else before, and the one opportunity that comes hand delivered to me on a silver platter I can't get it up? I do some research into the possibilities and I had to face my music: I had developed PIED. I had found it in my searches and I had the symptoms: No random boners, no morning wood, no boners from being with pretty woman with physical contact. Prior to the peak of my porn addiction I distinctly remember having held hands with women and getting rock hard. And the sensation was gone. I was disgusted and ashamed of myself and vowed to never masturbate to porn again.

Shortly after I discovered this I told A everything and she was supportive. Me and A ended up taking a break from dating about a week later, because I really wanted to explore my sexuality some more before thinking about committing. So I started looking for guys and had almost immediate success. Being a guy looking for guys on Tinder is really something; I had a match within the first day of changing my preference. I went on dates with three different guys and subbed to one of them, making me no longer a virgin. Admittedly he gave amazing head and I was able to get erect having been fap free for about a month but I didn't orgasm, or particularly enjoy gay sex because I didn't like the feeling of him inside me. More specifically I never really felt my G spot down there during the whole thing so I don't know if I have it. Even though I have had people tell me every guy is supposed to have a g spot, I still didn't like the feeling of a penis thrusting up and down the same muscles I use to poop and it was not a comfortable feeling. Ultimately I decided I prefer dating women. The intimacy between a man and a woman, and the fact that I'm more attracted to a pretty woman than a handsome man is what made me decide this.

Me and A get back to dating, because we agreed we would give us another shot after I explore myself if we were both still single. We try going on some more dates but the spark just isn't there. She was able to jerk me off however, granted with a little help from me because her hand got tired, but I orgasmed and it was great. I was so happy. She said she wanted to be friends right before 2018 ended, and I was a little heartbroken, but got over it quickly because we were never official or anything. In hindsight I'll admit I kind of rushed things, like I went from having sex with a dude to getting back with A within a week. Also, the combination of telling a woman you want to date guys and the fact that I couldn't get it up both were turnoffs (and my fault, really should of tried exploring myself earlier in life so I could have known what I liked and not develop PIED due to not scoring). And there's also the fact that we never had great conversational chemistry. I agreed to be friends.

Cut to 2019. An old high school female friend (""B"") is moving across the country soon and wants to meetup before she goes. We were acquainted in highschool about 4 years ago, and we had met up last summer break to hang out. I felt sparks between us then but didn't act on it because she goes to college far away. This last Friday we catchup, we're making each other laugh, we're talking about our experiences dating, and I tell her I'm bi. She was so happy to hear that because she was also bi and I told her everything about my dive into dating men. I feel sparks fly again between us, one thing led to another, and we agreed we could hookup before she moves. The next day I have her in the backseat of my car and she was amazing.

Me and B had much better chemistry than me and A. B is fiercely intelligent, an excellent conversationalist, and is more my type physically. She did not want sex, vaginal/oral, and most unfortunately, had gotten her period earlier than expected, so I couldn't finger her. She did however give her absolutely stunning D cup breasts, thick thighs, and ass to me to play and feel with, which was much appreciated. At one point she was on top of me, essentially humping me, but I was unable to get fully erect. She also tried putting her boobs between my dick and again, was not able to get fully erect. Admittedly it might have again been the awkwardness of doing it in a car but I was concerned I might not be able to get erect. Thankfully, after some kissing and her jerking me off I was fully hard. I ejaculated after a bit of work and despite B not orgasming she said she still had a good time.

So in the end, after 66 days I seem to be recovered to the point where I can orgasm from a different person's hand and not my own. Kissing and another person jerking me off are both turn ons for me, however the ""real deal"" stuff like having my penis/hands on a woman's breasts, thighs, or just her being on top of me did not get me up. I was wondering if anyone had advice on how to rewire my brain to get re-aroused to things other than hands jerking me off. (And want to thank anyone who reads this whole thing, and apologize if it was confusing to understand at points. If it seems like a lot happened over a short period of time then you're correct).

TLDR: Got PIED, been fap free since November 1st, was able to get it up yesterday but mainly to handjobs, how should I go about rewiring my brain to get turned on to the whole female body?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ad8re4/a_partial_success_story_from_someone_who_was_a/

7122,Motivation,There's always tomorrow... (how to avoid relapse),"I've found myself going down the slippery slope today.

No relapse, no peeking... just behaviours that *will* lead to a relapse if left unchecked.

But then I realised... in the past I've been really good at procrastination... failing to get done what I want to get done through lack of action...

And I can use that for positive reasons too... **I can always put off relapsing to tomorrow.**

I don't need to do it today. I can get through the rest of today clean and figure out if I still want to relapse tomorrow.

Just that simple thought has made me feel so much lighter... It's *my* choice... I'm not being *forced* into behaviour that I don't want.

Tomorrow I'll do my best to redirect any excess energy into creative pursuits.

I am on day 6 of the streak. So far so good. I will do a full report once i get into double figures but few benefits so far.

- after day 3, I feel happier
-moods are better, feel somewhat more confident
-dont feel dirty or shameful
- energy levels better and I appear to be dreaming more. Had a dream about aliens which was weird.
-feel more driven but less bothered about useless things.

There is no question that watching of porn and fapping is and does cause serious problems for me in terms of my general mental state. I Always feel shameful after it like I have comnited a fukin sin or something.

I Just feel better off it. 

One slight issue I have is i had sex with my partner and my mood has took a bit of a dive? Is this normal?

I also had a little ache down below which caused a little discomfort.

Long story short, I feel alot better by the 4th day in but worry that any sexual stimulation kind of wrecks the benefits?

Maybe we as humans are designed purely to breed and not experience lots of pleasure I dunno maybe I am wrong..

7233,Advice to NoFap,Feel The Power and Transmute It.,"I have noticed that when I am have insane urges and not to sound woo woo (this is in part inspired by Think And Grow Rich) but I have personally realised the urge is the build up of sexual energy. However, because it such a massive spike in energy it can be unbearable for fappers to wield so they immediately release it through PMO.

**Now when I feel an urge I do this:**

1. Realise I have an urge
2. 10-20 pushups to offset some energy
3. Take 10 deep breaths
4. Truly realise the amount of energy I now have
5. Transmute it into another form (creative, business, social, gym, or organisation)
6. Repeat when I have another urge

This kinda goes beyond NoFap into other areas that may have been atrophied due to PMO, however its a way I have used NoFap. Hope this helps!",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adakla/feel_the_power_and_transmute_it/

7608,Question to NoFap,Uh Oh...,"Hello Fellow Fapstronauts, Glad To Be Apart Of The Community!

I am having an issue regarding discharge while pooping. I’ve done NoFap 3 times for a little over 30 days, just got started this summer (Have also been off porn for over 6 months, God has been good to me). I’m currently on day 12 from my last relapse. This is an issue I have had since the very first day I started and I am slightly worried.  

I know that discharge is normal when starting, but mine seems to be an extreme case. Even on day one, just waking up in the morning to poop, I have massive discharge. I could discharge 3 times a day if I pooped that often.  I am on Vyvanse 40mg for my ADHD and I know this could factor into it. However, when I started this summer I was not and had the exact same problem.  It feels like my gut is full of semen and wants to come out.  Before bed, it really makes me want to pee and I can’t fall asleep so I have to go to sit on the toilet and push it all out. Yet again in the morning I could still discharge a lot.

(On a side note, I don’t even have social media, yet alone look at anything sexually explicit, I hate TV)

I had a full STD and UTI test recently, and came back perfectly clean. I am also sexually inactive and have been for a year and 8 months (GOTTA FIX THOSE PESKY NEURO-PATHWAYS!) I had my blood tested a little while back, and I have quite a high testosterone level (I’m 20, guess this makes sense haha) and wondered if this may factor into it? Also, I have a sleep study coming up and my doctor suspects I have narcolepsy. Could this also factor into it?

7641,Relapse Report,"So, I've just broken my 113-days streak, but I actually feel OK.","Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm proudly writing this relapse report as of now, since I've just broke my 113-days streak without O. Yet, I do not feel as *horrible or ashamed or unaccomplished*  as I thought I would feel.

Let me break down what I went through, then my thoughts and comments on the whole experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**Process:**

So, It's been almost 4 months without me giving myself the sweet taste of orgasming, yet I have to admit a few things; things like I did really watch a lot of porn and I did masturbate a lot, I just either edged or while in the middle of masturbation I'd just  *glance out of it and remember the NoFap oath I swore to myself*, or just remind myself of how far I have went without O. Yet, as I said, I have let myself watch Porn and there were these intense times when I was so frustrated, stressed and really depressed so much, that I needed to make myself a bit happy **OR** at least less stressful. I did not let myself do it until today; and for personal reasons I, in some sorta way, think I had to. *I'll explain later as to why.*

I've to mention I am a single guy *because I kind of have high standard and some fear of commitments*, and premarital sex is something I personally feel so guilty about. So I had no give, please remember this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts:**

So, after having done this ""P-M"" or just ""M"" cycles A LOT of times throughout the 113 days, *which for some of you might seem I broke the NoFap, but I do not agree,* The NoFap has ACTUALLY helped me solve MANY problems in my life, and I've wrote about this in a post before. It helped me recover physically, eventually overcome my ""daily weakness"", it helped me psychologically, I was WAY less depressed than before *specially that I reduced the rate of Porn Watching*, it made me feel more energetic, more confident about myself, more attentive, smarter, and actually starting to appreciate things in life that I had no appreciation to before, like art and music or maybe walking down the street watching people pass by, I'm not kidding you.

All of that was so sweet, adding to that the pride of having the 3 months+ streak, it was so awesome. But lately, I've been having some ""let's say sexual frustration"", like I really REALLY need to either have sex or let my self go, you'd expect a release by now of maybe a wet-dream or something. I worked out, went for running, changed my eating habits, stopped watching porn for a while, even started meditating and it was still there, the idea of hooking up or just releasing the stress came a lot to my mind. So, I choose the lesser of the two evils. I started changing ""the kind of porn I watch"", make it much more subtler, things I know I won't get addicted to and things that do not and will not make me want more. But guess what, you never get enough of it; Porn is addictive. That's when I started ""wanting more"", that's when I realized I'm going back into this BAD loop. So, I decided I'd just stick to one thing and see if I can still prevent the O. I won't delve into the details but *tldr* I gave in but ""after watching some subtle porn"", it was more out of frustration, pressure and too much libido. That's when it hit me ""WTF AM I DOING? I HAVE BROKE MY 113-DAYS STREAK OMG FU... uhm ... Wait a minute, it's over, I've given in and nothing will fix that EXCEPT actually acting on it, I don't feel as guilty or as bad as I think I would, so let's use it"". What you do not expect is that I felt ""so much calmer"", I felt **literally high**, I felt I am UP for a longer challenge, and the first two things I did was to delete my whole porn folder (with confidence), and come write this relapse report.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

So, as an conclusion to this. I've realized that I somehow needed to do this ""only at this time, not before or after"" and with this amount of P, M and O. Did I relapse? Fuck yeah I did. Did I fuck up? No, I'm ready for an even GREATER challenge. I made a mistake of allowing myself watch Porn and actually touching myself, this was my first mistake. I learned and now I act. I'll prohibit myself from watching porn as a first step and I know that this time will be longer than the time before it.

So, do not give up guys. It's a new journey and we're all into it!

7648,Question to NoFap,The million dollar NoFap question,"I was recently listening to The Joe Rogan podcast and came across an interesting thought. Something that both you and I have definitely faced. 

Is there any way to completely release pent up sexual energy? Most NoFapers would say something like

“Use that energy to do something else. 50 push ups or pull ups. Or run around your block. Or hell, would those girls even have sex with you bro?!”

All really good advice. I know because it’s helped me and most of you too. 

But is there *really* any sure way to *completely* release pent up sexual energy? 

In my experience, nothing compares to cumming. All the push ups and pull ups and workouts and mild self-shaming could never amount to it. 

I’ve tried NoFap a couple times. It worked incredibly well at first because I was out of control at the time. Nowadays I’m a lot more mature and only release when it’s necessary or beneficial. 

That being said - big, big ups to NoFap for the inspiration.

7958,Emergency - Help!,2 months so far... supposed to fuck a girl soon but still have problems Help:(,"So I've been doing nofap on hardmode for about two months now... and it's been pretty beneficial to my life so far. I mean I gotta speak for myself and I'm not the generic success story that I've found all across the board when looking a other's stories and nofap timelines (I know every case is different). I've definitely gained way more motivation and self discipline but still have social anxiety (less though). These two months have been rocky with lots of depression, mood swings and ups and downs. Some days I feel on top of the world ready to conquer anything then it'll flip like a switch and feel like shit and completely hopeless. So basically I started my pmo addiction about 4 years ago (sophomore in hs) and am now a 2nd semester sophomore in college. I was never really serious about quitting until my habit got really unhealthy. Began developing fetishes: began abnormally large breasts, then macromastia (larger than life tits...lol), then lactation. Once this wouldn't make me hard I started focusing more on girls asses in porn and this lead to a weight gain fetish. I ended up bringing this fetish in to the real world with my hs gf at the time. She would gain weight for me so her ass and tits would increase in size. This was obviously super selfish of me and unhealthy for our relationship. During this time I also developed an addiction to using amphetamines (adderall/vyvanse) to get an even bigger dopamine rush while pmo'ing. This lead to abnormally long pmo sessions (3-4 hours+) which began probably about 1.5 years ago. I'm sure this is has really fucked with my brain the most especially with introducing other substances (amphetamines, nicotine, weed, &amp; sometimes alc). I've been trying to quit pmo for some time now (about a year or so) and have relapsed too many times to count:( I was't really dedicated to quitting until about 3 or 4 months ago. My first serious attempt was first semester this year after making it like 2.5-3 weeks. I realized instagram and social media bullshit was the main trigger in my relapses so I deleted it all except for snap (communication purposes). This time around being almost two months in has been surprisingly a lot easier after deleting social media. Obviously the first couple days were shitty but after that I went straight into deadline at the end of the first week. I'm pretty sure im still in a deadline with temporary spurts of being horny. So ive been in a flatline for at least 50 days and I'm wondering when this is gonna end. Ive been getting noticeably more horny during the night-time but feel nothing during the day. I'm past the shriveled dick phase for the most part but still cannot get hard without stimulation during the day. At night I get hard sporadically while awake in bed and have even begun to have sexual dreams (the most intense was last night). I ejaculated during my sleep last week but have no recollection of this dream:( I met a new girl during finals week before winter break who I've had intense make out sessions with. She would have had sex with me a month ago but I was deep (3 weeks) into flatline and on an amphetamine so I couldn't get hard. I had to divert and tell her to look forward to it until after the break. This surprisingly worked really well and she wants to fuck even more now:) I'm just afraid I'm gonna fuck it up and have anxiety or still be in a flatline or something like that. Any words of wisdom/advice on how long I got left? I'm hoping the sexual dreams are a big step in the final recovery process regardless of how weird they have been lol. I really like this girl and could see myself having a deep meaningful relationship with her. She is wayy hotter than my ex but a lot skinner (small tits but a fat ass) but her assets are definitely smaller than what my ex had. I'm just kind of afraid my dick wont work for me after being so used to having frequent sex with my old girl for over a year. I mean I haven't had sex in like 4-5 months so I'm hoping it'll all workout... especially being on nofap now. I just wanna go back to being the horny little 7 year old I was getting rock fucking hard watching britney spears on commercials:( Any advice/personal stories are greatly appreciated!

8084,Telling my Story,Personal experience lol :--D,"I'm 18 and from Finland. 
My life is going otherwise super-well and I can say that porn has damaged me alot. Nothing i can't recover from though. 

Basically I've always been a bit antisocial, by choice really, and because I had an addiction to videogames few years ago. And due to some personal matters perhaps, but I've had a couple of nice girls hinting that they like me that way, but I turned them down because.. Well, more about that later. 

 I got into my first relationship recently which opened my eyes: Not having a partner to try to have sex with at kept ME (everyone is different) blind about the dangers of porn. Atleast the overuse. 

I beat off to some pornhub stuff, suddenly that's not enough, find something little kinkier--&gt; the cycle continues. Next thing I know; I'm watching some really fucked up stuff. Now I've read various articles about overloading the reward center and I'm pretty sure that was what was happening. 

I mentioned those few girls I would've liked to get into relationship/or laid with, hinting to do just that, but there was something keeping me from saying yes. I had too much pressure about sex (Porn addiction also goes hand to hand with overthinking and insecurity and probably alot more bad traits).

The main reason that motivated me to write this mess is the fact that now when I'm thinking about actually (doesn't feel the same when you're not actually about to get laid) having sex, I get mad pressure about it (TOO MUCH. It would be manageable without my previous addiction lol) 

Ran out of motivation here xD, but my point is out there somewhere. 

TL;DR
I had not been in a relationship until now and, in my case, it opened my eyes on the damage porn had caused on many things

I wrote this if someone can relate to me, can also realize the dangers, or tell a personal experience to them, in time to stop overuse to have a much better everything, really.

Since a week or so i've been reading up on the Nofap community and also started abstaining. The problem is that i am not sure if abstaining will help me. 
Sorry this sounds a bit vague, let me clarify. 

I've been together with my gf around 4,5 years now (i'm 21) and for the past two years our sexlife hasn't been great. I keep reading from other people that's they started doing these challenges because they can't be auroused by anything else then porn, i am the exact opposite. Since about two years  i get aroused by a lot and also with my girlfriend. The problem with that is that i am finished very very quickly (talking about between 45 seconds and 2 min), something i never had a problem with before those years. 
Because i keep reading that abstaining meant people started  getting aroused more by normal things (actual girls etc.) Instead of porn i wonder if it would be a right thing for me to do.

But how many are actually active? Who knows, maybe I'll never even post this but writing it all out might help. I don't even know if I'm allowed to post this here. 

\---

I have long moved on from the point where I deny I have a problem. It's obvious and uncontrollable and it's making me feel terrible.  I systematically lie about it to myself and to those I care about. This hurt me and even worse, it hurt them too.

&amp;#x200B;

The very first time I remember thinking - ""yea..this might be a problem"" - is when my then-time girlfriend asked me if I watch porn. ""Well, yea, what guy doesn't, right?"" I said. ""I guess. How often do you do it?"". Now, I'm a very honest guy. I don't like lying and prefer to tell the truth, but I couldn't bring myself to be honest. ""Just once or twice a week"" I lied. She was a little upset and indicated she though that was rather a lot. At least i prevented her being hurt worse, because it's closer too once or twice a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember that,  just when I started dating that girl, I told myself I should watch less porn. It feels a little like cheating, right? And I did. For a day, or two. After that I just felt a little guilty, but hey, every guy does it right?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I really liked this girl. She was funny, smart and really sexy and totally my type. I was super lucky to win her over. But, she was only one girl compared to the gazillions of girls I could find online. At some point, I started to desire her less. Sex was really nice and all, but compared to just rubbing one out it was a lot of work though. I stopped making the first move as much.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I like to tell myself we broke up for other reasons and I really believe we did. Of course, we dated for a long time and relationships are complicated. But our sex life, which was damaged by my addiction, was definitely playing a role.  At the time I didn't realize it was a problem yet. Everybody is doing it, right?. But after we broke up I had lots of time for introspection. I realized my behavior caused her a lot of pain. She didn't feel desired, she didn't feel wanted. Sure, she felt loved. We cuddled and hugged and showed a lot of affection. But I just simply got my sexual gratification from somewhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

This made me feel terrible. I told myself I'll quit porn all together. I promised myself I'd never watch porn again and instead masturbate to my fantasies. A shame all my fantasies are based on porno's I've seen. That one particular video with that one girl.. Oh well, maybe just use porn like a normal person: only every once in a while.  mean, everybody is doing it, right? Or when I'm really bored and have nothing to do. And well, this lead character in this show is really hot and it's distracting me from the plot. Or when I have a day off and am working from home. Or you know, once or twice every day. Fuck. This shit is insidious as a mother fucker.  Okay, I have a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to decrease my porn consumption. And I would, for a day. Maybe even two. But it's always this insidious moment of ""eh, one time won't matter"" followed by ""well, I already did it now anyway, might as well"" and the trusty ""well, one last time to close it all up"". I tried and I failed.

&amp;#x200B;

This went on like this for quite a while. I wasn't really dating anyone and one-night stands were usually disappointing. I was focusing on work and still trying to get over that girl. But then, I met a new girl, wow, she's gorgeous.  She's sexy as hell, but I'm in some foreign country for work and this is clearly going to be just another one-night-stand. She was super open and comfortably talked about anything. I didn't reach orgasm from intercourse. I rarely do now, or at least, I last very long with any kind of stimulation other then my hand+porn. Sometimes, not this time, my mind starts to wonder too, and I get a little soft. Turns out she lived only an hour away from me. What are the odds? We started seeing each other some more.

&amp;#x200B;

""You ever watch porn?"" She had asked at some point early on. Fuck, I knew this was coming ""Yea, what guy doesn't."" I replied vaguely and brushed it off.  I'd never lied to her before. Well, this isn't really a lie right? I was just being vague and didn't tell her the full truth. I wanted to tell her the truth, but I felt so embarrassed and guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

In a few weeks time we only managed to see each other a few times because I was flying all over the place for work. As a result, it stayed novel, exciting and arousing. She was much more kinky then I'm used to, too. It's all very new and exciting. Work calms down and I see her more often and we talk and we actually start dating. At this point we've still only seen each other 3, maybe 4 times. I never actually managed to come from intercourse, but it still feels amazing and both of us are enjoying it. One night, and fuck, even typing it out to strangers feels so embarrassing. One night I start going a little limp. Not all the way, enough to work with, but it's noticeable.  I get a little upset, but she's super chilled. ""It happens to the best"" and ""we've been at it for some time, take a break"". She's so genuine, it melts my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

I tell her about my problem. The porn. For how longs it's been going on. I tell her I think that's why I'm lasting so long and why, sometimes, I have some difficulty keeping it up. And that I can't seem to stop. I tell her I've never told anybody else this, any of it. ""Well, let's do something about it then"". We talked about it. What it feels like, how it's not even giving me any pleasure. It's just this thing, that happens. I don't control it. I don't even like it. It just happens and I'll move on two seconds later.  I'm watching porn of things I wouldn't even wanna do or even think about, but I just keep clicking the weirder or harder stuff to keep it new.

&amp;#x200B;

She's amazing and so, so supportive. Even though it hurts her too. She helped me, with positive feedback and reward. I don't do it for a day? ""Well done!"" Two? ""Keep it up!"" Three? ""Amazing!"" I have a relapse? ""Well, that's okay."" - she's hurt and a little disappointed, but she tries not to show it. - ""It happens, just look how far you managed to come though. It'll be easier next time."" She was right, it got a little easier each time. Sex got even better too. I even managed to come from intercourse, fuck I felt like i was 17 again and just lost my virginity.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to last a month. And then two. At some point it almost became normal. I became arrogant. Three months.  I can do this. I'm stronger than this. I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I lied. Well, I didn't. I just didn't tell I relapsed.That's not a lie, right? I'll just start over again. I know I can it now.  After a few week she asked me about it. I should've been honest.  I wasn't. I felt terrible. I should've said it was three weeks ago now. I said 3 months. I couldn't bear her disappointment, nor my own shame.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it happend again. I lied last time, It'll be even worse If I tell her now. It happens again. and again I have no control. It's as bad as before. It's worse, because now I lied about it.

&amp;#x200B;

\----

This post has already taken me an hour and a half too write. I intended to go on, but I need to cut it off here. In the end we broke up, too. This wasn't all to blame, but it definitely didn't make it better.  Now I've been single for a while again, and I have zero control. This is me, trying again not to fuck up my life with this.

8236,Question to NoFap,I had a thought that came up and i would like to hear your opinion on it,"tl;dr : Is everyone shallow as f\*\*\*? how can i not hate every girl on earth when i become attractive one day?  
I dont want to feel so vengeful and resentful about people.

Hey you guys.

First and foremost: i am fat. i have always been fat, not attraktive at all, never been. I've been invisible to girls my whole life basically. I have attraktive guy-friends though. I get along great with them. But throughout my whole life i always felt that they could say the most idiotic and shallow things but everyone (mostly girls) is laughing and liking them and admiring them and try to get their attention. I am a pretty funny guy, as all fat people on the f\*\*\* planet have to be to survive in social situations, so i get everyone to laugh now and then but i reeaaally have to try and think of the best things to say to get a reaction that is not &gt;ignoring me and disliking me by default&lt;.

Every time when girls talked about me in the context of dating or romance, its been the old and infamous ""great guy but more as a friend blabla""

So. When i am attractive someday, how can i not feel so damn disappointed in every person i meet, for treating me differently because now they are attracted to me? How in the world is there a f\*\*\* exclusive first class club that can grant you an awesome life if you just LOOK GOOD (and maybe not be an asshole to the point of illegality).  


I don't want to feel so vengeful and resentful about people. I love people! i love talking to them i love making them laugh i love experiencing new things with them. But i fear to always have that feeling of... ""I would be nothing to them, they wouldn't give me that attention and they wouldn't be that nice to me if i we're still fat and not good looking.""

8324,Advice to NoFap,"It's not just porn we fight, it's misery","I have plenty of free time, so I could analyze my own behaivor a little better and I've come up with this theory. It might seem obvious to some but it wasn' the case for me.
First off, outline:
Overall there are a couple of things I can do everyday. I usually have these options: playing games, watch movies/anime, study to improve myself.
Note: here's no socializing, because I'm still weak on that front.

The point:
From experince I've gotten quite a good idea of the reason I fap.
I fap because I don't do anything productive or socializing and then feel like shit (whether conscious or not).
The most important of our resources is energy or effort or whatever you wanna call it. Fapping wastes it and doesn't allow me to do these things which makes it easier to fap again (cycle of doom).

I concluded that in order to avoid fapping I must do things that are productive (studying) or appear to be so (games) and  socialize irl or appear to do so through anime/movies, so as to say, fight misery in any way possible.

!The important point though is that a person only has so much energy, due to a recent relapse, a lack of decent sleep, etc.
So there is no need to sneer at games, anime, movies (as long as they're not turning into an addiction of course), because they have their use.
Not everybody can afford to change their life radically too quickly or can do everything at once.

Hope this post helps someone.

8328,Advice to NoFap,"Reading is not just a ""cool habit"", it REALLY helps on NoFap","Reading is not just a ""cool habit"", that you do because other fapstronauts here are recommending it. It is **essential** for you if you want to have a more significant life. Not only reading, writing too (whereas good practice of one leads to another).

If you read literature regularly, you aquire more culture, see other experiences, experiences of all humankind across the time. It feeds imagination, and a mature imagination is a prevention against depression (when you don't see any more solutions for a big problem, that's when depression sets in). And with literature I mean GOOD literature, like the western classics, from the greco-roman epics to Shakespeare, Dante, Melville etc.

If you know your language and write correctly you can manage your thoughts easier, make your mind more clear, you speak better and have more confidence and self steem, besides helping on your job.

You must READ and WRITE better, not just because of NoFap, but you must understand it as a **moral obligation**, for yourself, your family, your community and even for your country, because doing this make you a better person in many different ways. Reading regularly and writing better ARE THE BASICS.

I say these things not just as a advice, but as a personal report too. When I read these guides here in the community, I tend not to treat ""Reading/writing"" with the importance it deserves. So, I hope we all can see clearly the importance of those habits and DEVOUR more books. We should aim at the highest target!

*(Before someone says I'm recommend these all at the same time as I write in a mediocre way, English is not my first language).*

8595,Advice to NoFap,NO FAP WARNING (Don’t do something stupid like i did),"I’m 22 and this was during my final year of University. 

I thought i’d share a story with you all of my first attempt of no fap and a stupid mistake i made SO YOU WONT DO THE SAME THING!

It was the 1st of February 2018, sitting around in our Uni house in the UK, me and my mates decided to do our very own twist on ”No Nut November” and came up with “Fap Free February” as we called it. 

There were 5 of us attempting this no fap challenge, however, the first bit of bad news comes here as 2/5 didn’t make it past the first day! (and weren’t ashamed to admit it either).

But the 3 remaining were focussed, i was focussed! February is the shortest month, i only had to last that long, we were all inundated with Uni work anyway as our dissertation deadline was fast approaching, it seemed like the perfect time to try No Fap. 

Within weeks i was feeling the benefits:

* More Energy
* More Confidence
* Increased Motivation 
* Mental Clarity
* My Skin and Beard was in great condition! 
* ALOT more female attention.

Literally everything was looking up, (including my dick as i did get extremely horny at times) but i persevered. I’d made it through the month (all 3 of us did) and i was ready to start “Masturbationless March”.

By now you’re probably wondering what was the mistake i’d made?

Well it all started with the female attention i was getting, from one girl in particular who was showing a lot of interest in me. We were already friends and had been for a long time but her interest had become way more sexual. I was NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST, sexually or emotionally attracted to her so tried to ignore her moves and flirtatiousness. 

One night at the pub with my mates after celebrating our hand in she was there, None of us had much to drink and went home pretty early because we had another big week of deadlines ahead of us.

We all left the pub and she decided to walk with us because her house wasn’t far from ours, it was really bad cold snowy weather in the UK and we had a snowball fight on the way but when we got to our front door, she walked upstairs, took her shoes and jacket off an lay on my bed.

Me and all my friends were really confused however i went and sat on the bed next to her and just had a chat and offered to walk her home, my friends even came and lay on the bed with us and chatted for a while but i could feel this weird sexual tension between us getting stronger and stronger. When all my friends finally went to bed i STUPIDLY offered to let her stay the night to which she agreed, took her clothes off and got into my bed. 

(WHAT THE FUCK WAS I DOING, LETTING MY DICK CONTROL MY THOUGHTS AFTER DOING SO WELL! I LET MY HORNINESS AND IMPULSIVENESS TAKE OVER MY HEAD WHEN I HAD BEEN SO MENTALLY STRONG!… all for a girl i wouldn’t look twice at on a normal day i was friends with her but surely if something was to happen, it would ruin our friendship?).

But stupidly i took my clothes off and joined her, after some heavy petting i made her orgasm, and by now we were both (regrettably) very horny. I gave in and before i knew it we were having sex.

I had never had a one night stand before this, only sex with girls i was connected to in relationships with and so this was a huge regret for me! **The guilt was too much and i gave up my No Fap Streak the day after due to the guilt, i felt like i needed to get it out of my system.** (The sex didn’t even make me orgasm) FML!

Me and the girl were and haven’t been the same since, it was a stupid mistake and wasn’t worth jeopardising a friendship! 

MORAL OF THE STORY:

* No matter how horny you get, don’t give in to how horny you feel!
* Sex with a girl you don’t care about was NO MORE PLEASURABLE due to No Fap.
* Sex WAS way more desirable (so BE CAREFUL).
* Guilt can make you fap to feel better, its a vicious cycle.
* Don't have sex with someone your best self wouldn't have sex with for No Fap, it's better to lose your streak than make this mistake.

January the 1st 2019 No Fap started again for me, I’m new to Reddit but just want to thank this community for the support I’ve had so far just from reading! and hopefully my story will help the people who need it!

8602,Journal Check-In,No fap got me laid,"Vent ahead:

This year is going to be the year I make it 90 days. I’ve been participating in nofap for two years and my longest is 45 days

I’m currently in a ‘relationship’ or something like that, she called it seeing each other, I recently got into the dating scene and there seems to be a misunderstanding with the person I’m with. I’ve made it clear I don’t want kids or to marry in the future and the way this girl looked at me sometimes made me worry she was falling for me.

So last night I wanted to clear things up and when I brought it up she told me to leave. 

One thing nofap has helped me with is confidence and to apologize only when necessary, in other words not be such a pushover. I don’t feel like what I said was wrong. ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adoeg4/no_fap_got_me_laid/

Today I've had a really bad experience, after whatching it I've almost puked, I was disgusted by what I was seeing. It is really crazy and disturbing to keep going on something like this.

I have a super nice girfriend who I love, nice hobbies and things to learn. Why do we even need porn? How it became such a social acceptable thin? How sick is our society?

This post is my personal area. Every day at night I'll keep a track on it. I may not even post something about porn, I love to write about diferent aspects of life and chalenges that we encounter.

8620,Confession,75+ Relapses in 3 Weeks,"Hey Fapstronauts!

I want to start by saying God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit have been pumping life into me for the past few weeks despite my constant and consistent returns to vomit (the bad internet vids...)

Unfortunately, I have run out of luck. In other words, I am now both in a social situation and health situation that is detrimental to my life and future.

As you can tell by the title, I've been really stuck in a relapse. My mom and I agreed to work together on this with of course my doctor and a church pastor to support as well. Unfortunately, if I relapse during a good streak, I tend to lie and try to come back on my own.

Well, you can see how lyign has turned out, can't ya'?

My whole point is that you should never lie to those who help you. It only makes things worse. But rather than tell you this moral from a high ground, I say this unto you as a condemnation toward myself, and a plea of concern and advice to all of you, friends.

God Bless, and I look forward to hearing from you and growing on my journey in NoFap. To Him be the Glory.

8711,Relapse Report,Restarting after 175 days. My real mistake.,"Hey guys, so I'm starting fresh after a relapse at 175 days. I honestly think I needed to relapse, simply to make sure everything still worked and clean out the pipes a bit. I didn't watch a lot of porn and I only spent about 15 mins on it. Didn't feel much different afterwords. The real mistake was doing it again a week later, then again another time, watching porn the night before, and the day of for like two+ hours. Now I'm feeling the stuff that usually comes with a relapse. But I'm back in the game now and I'm going to focus on making the next 90 days the most productive, perhaps even the best days of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Benefits wise, I do feel like there is a bit of a decline in confidence, but the progress made in those 175 days is definitely still with me. The biggest thing is going from having nothing to hide, to once again having something to hide. A couple days and that feeling will be gone again though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the biggest thing going forward is to have the confidence that I gain as I'm on nofap come from within myself instead of from the day counter or the simple fact I'm on nofap. Nofap is just a tool. To get real self confidence it has to come from within yourself, and it has to be because of yourself, not because of some external thing. Real progress in this area should stay with you even after you relapse. It's hard to put this in words, I'll think on it and perhaps update this post or make a new one on this topic.

Stay strong everyone, and remember that you are awesome. ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adpjbp/restarting_after_175_days_my_real_mistake/
8725,Relapse Report,Will have to overcome P,"Hi all,

I am a porn addict. Started when I was 14, now 32. Feel like shit on a daily basis emotionally. Have full blown pied and over time7 years back, due to de-sensitisation, my interest in porn moved to trans/gay.

Have been on Nofap journey for 6 months, managed 36 day streak once and 9 days second best. Now relapsing every 2 days. Nothing great going in personal life(marriage on rocks due to porn addiction). High stress job and office politics. All combined to make porn an alternative where I can get a temporary high. 

Tried my best to come out of this addiction multiple times but always end up relapsing. Also combined with pied and extreme fetish porn made me question my sexuality and severely impaired my confidence. Also brain fog, back ache, overweight and impulsivity in decision making. Yeah can add depression to that list!!

Guys be mindful of the issues it will cause and steer clear of  P. I am a living example of how it destroys self confidence, dignity  and relationships that you value. I loved my wife dearly but due to porn addiction and pied issues, I always acted emotionally distant and all of it is coming back to haunt me. 

To be honest, I am out of options and even thought of suicide sometimes. But understand that the path to freedom from P is through self restraint and discipline. Will take it one day at a time and first target is to beat my previous streak and aim for 90.

All the best to others struggling with this addiction!!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adpndh/will_have_to_overcome_p/

8847,Relapse Report,Just lost my near 1 month streak - Summary of my journey,"So I got to 22 days. 

This is a summary of my journey and how I relapsed. 

First week was always the hardest stage but it is also the stage where you are most determined. So it’s really your will power(at its peak) vs temptation, fighting that constant urge and battling it. 
It was my first time in a long time when I got through 1 week. Truly felt great. 

Week 2 was a lot easier, and I thought I got it. New year, new me. No more of this, I will win. 
Went by week 2 with a slight battle when I decided to have a bubble bath after a long time. Eventually won through sheer will power. 

Week 3. Have absolutely no desire whatsoever. I could really feel myself getting cleaner. 
However, I came across some nsfw content in the internet in some really random way, i didn’t even look for them. Like honestly, the internet is way too full of adult content and it really boils my blood. Anyhow this is what started to cause some slight temptations within me. (This was in the beginning of week 3).

This is how I fell, and it pretty much all happened today. So I Have a discord server with nsfw content and while I was talking to my friend I randomly saw that tag and decided to “look into it” and after looking at a few images. Stopped myself, told myself no! And everything was fine until 
 a few hours ago when I was trying to sleep and Thats when I really felt the edge. Those images just kept flashing in my mind and this eventually all led to me to relapse. Breaking my streak. I feel pretty sad, that it had to break. But now I know that the littlest of temptation can cause you to edge and lose to temptation. 

In other words. Don’t look at porn. Don’t look at nsfw content. It will make you edge and you’ll eventually do the deed. 

If you guys have any advice on how I can win in the future when in a situation like this, please let me know!

8858,Question to NoFap,Being realistic for a sec,"Well this community isn’t new to me at all i have tried no fap probably more than anyone but yet still fail cuz of multiple reasons but before i tell u them i gotta ask some questions, 
1st : don’t we all have build in sexual energy that needs to be released for our own health and sake ? ( side note : don’t tell me go have sex with your gf , i am from a place where doing such thing could get you prison time )
2nd : why does PMO haunt us ?, like for instance you can’t do anything without noticing something to turn you on for example: I can’t open my phone to do anything 
Youtube : all music videos now look like porn movies
Reddit : multiple subreddits with more porn than ever , even in meme accounts 
Facebook : multiple accounts with pics of hot sexy girls and No not porn related but how do u expect me to see a pic of a famous actress practically naked and not get hard
Twitter : the motherland of all social media porn and horny people 
Instagram : thirst traps everywhere 
That is just the first example , same thing goes for the TV i mean you can’t expect me to just open any religious channel all the day just to avoid sexual content and not get bored or wanna kill myself , dont get me started on movies , 
Your friends could be your biggest strength or biggest obstacle, most of them like myself are porn addicts and I tried to help them in quitting but they couldn’t and when they couldn’t I couldn’t, 
ALL OF YOUR FEMALE FRIENDS : i have a fair few models as some of my close friends and I can’t help but notice some of them have nice bodies, beautiful faces heck some of them are sluts 
Relationships : so far all my thoughts of relationships are build on two things love and teasing like whenever i used to get a call from my gf and we would like talk about how much we love each other GOD i would have the hardest boner , if we met i would be dying to kiss her or even hug her but sadly i live in a culture the prevents all stuff like this before marriage for religious reasons

I’m far from being satisfied, but today started to see my path. You’ll find your path one day. Enjoy the journey, soak in the high, learn from the lows.

8928,Relapse Report,A Young Bull’s Perspective,"Hello, I have made a thread before. About how I have had a struggling addiction and how I need help.

Well, now times have changed in a month or so, as I just relapsed for the first time of the year. As soon as I did I thought of how I brought myself shame and dishonor and all that stuff about, NoNutNineteen but a simple little thought can come into fruition. It’s only been the 7th day well 8th but I only count seven days. And I realize a few things as I will become seventeen the end of this year.

• I noticed that, I finally got to enjoy life a bit more as I used to be a ball of sadness and depression always saying, “ why me? “ and never really controlled my anger to a point but over the course of a week I realize that things can change. 

• I noticed facial hair growth has came in more, in just a week as I was a bit geeked out to see that and I also notice a bit more energy.

• I still get lingering thoughts as I did just relapse but it’s a process and I am afraid of change.

NoFap is something I thought of as a joke at first but there is a dedicated community for reform and blossom, and I hope well not hope, I know my time will be for me to get out this cocoon of porn and become a free butterfly and go around and show the beauty of self control, discipline, and growth. I have plans to just become more into fitness and become more healthy for the rest of the year, and I will do something to dedicate my time to NoFap and that’s just growing dreads. As for those they mean spiritual growth but I want to get them to show that, I have grown from a child to a man, as that is also a tedious process of patience and willpower so wish me luck and keep being busy!

I also plan to erase my socials.

8968,Journal Check-In,Longest streak to date line crossed this morning,"Those who are starting to recognise me will know that I don't like porn so don't really have a problem with that, I'm using nofap as part of an overall selfdev lifestyle change to keep a masculine edge and high sex drive so that I force myself to maintain a lifelong sense of self-esteem and charm, a life spent with women, not even only in a sexual way - just because I find them one of the gifts of life and enjoy their company. Without abstinence, I find myself not making an effort to maintain a social life with women and fall into a scarcity mindset.

I'm not relying on nofap to stay out of this scarcity mindset as I know the majority of this is psychological. But periodic abstinence cycles seem to keep me focused on following the ""fire in my belly"", so it's not entirely placebo. There's definitely a usefulness to being driven by your sexual urges and not submitting to them.

In 6 days I'll have reached my first target to allow myself an MO without considering it a relapse, but at the moment I'm feeling like I might want to continue the streak and go all the way in monk mode and become sexually active again.

I'll put my sexual energy into my artwork between intercourse. I have a feeling this is what the great artists seen as 'romantic and sexual' did and do.

Today's important quote: ""art and sex are the same thing."" - Picasso

Worth noting: I am HIGHLY feeling a sense of fullness in my crotch the past couple of days and feel I need the 'relief', especially as I'm getting highly turned on by a girl at work... So I do want this day 14 relief, I'm not finding it a piece of cake as some people start saying when they're on a high (like I feel), and if arousal continues to be as distracting at work as it was starting to become yesterday (and I become too sexual with girls not just have a 'sexual edge'), I will let off the steam at day 14. But if things calm a bit again (I'm not wanting a full flatline as that defeats the purpose for me) I will keep the streak going.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adrk0k/longest_streak_to_date_line_crossed_this_morning/

8993,Advice to NoFap,OK GUYS LET ME HELP YOU!,"Two main points we are going to talk about. I learned these through experience and pls let me know if I miss something.

1. Your Mind
2. How to control your mind

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Scenario you are on a dating app you see a cute girl your mind instantly imagines you fucking her. You get a feeling in your chest and now you're so horny that you have to fucking let one loose. Well the good news is you only got horny because you thought of something that got you horny. You dont ever out of the blue just get horny. Your thoughts are what trigger your dick. 
2. Well I stopped PMOing October 7 and I realized something very interesting. My mind is fucked up from all the porn ive watched (14 years). Once I realized point 1, I realized a lot of things. For instance: I would think about fucking then after I resist the urge I literally feel depressed. I think how I made a mistake at work and I get anxious and start analyzing what I couldve done better a million times. Then I start thinking about a goddamn train of anxious thoughts that will never end. I came to one conclusion. The world or my situation isn't making me feel like shit but my mind makes me feel like shit. Like shit shit. Like I want to lay in bed and touch my average sized pee-pee all day and fucking cry shit. Here's how you control your mind.  Watch this -[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diRQiarlWJc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diRQiarlWJc)OK guys here's what I did. Anytime I felt anxious I took a 5 minute cold shower. This resets your emotions and your thoughts once you come out of the shower you have to actively think positive thoughts. When ever you feel depressed you  just do like 10 minutes of yoga-[https://www.youtube.com/user/SarahBethShow](https://www.youtube.com/user/SarahBethShow) The posture videos make me feel amazing. AFTER YOU DO YOGA DO NOT START THINKING NEGATIVE SHIT. You have to actively think of positive shit. I noticed when I am in bed and I feel anxious as a mofo I dont want to go Cold shower. I just want to lay in bed and toss in turn. THIS IS YOUR MOTHERFUCKING MIND TRYING TO FUCK YOU!!!!! You need to be conscious of when your mind is fucking you harder than youve ever been fucked. When you are down and you tell yourself ""oh i feel like shit I dont want to do yoga"" THAT IS YOUR FUCKING MIND TRYING TO FUCK YOU.

In conclusion dont let your mind fuck you. Grab that motherfucker by the goddamn balls and make it think what you want it to think and make it make your body do what you want it to do. Its a motherfucker and it deserves no mercy nor remorse. ",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adrvxh/ok_guys_let_me_help_you/
9008,Motivate Me,Guys do not start fapping!,"NoFap is a change of heart and if you do it, you're in the right direction.

I bet you haven't heard the fact but many successful millionaires have stopped fapping. This is how their mindset has been established and they continue developing with the help of NoFap.

Michael Grzegorvievicz, a polish multimillionaire once says in an interview:

""For me, fapping was the biggest mistake which drew me back from success. I have not believed that a simple habit like this one can ruin your life.""

Researchers from the ""Associazione Sanitaria Italiana"", a.k.a ASI (Italian health association) carried out a research showing that masturbating can be as bad as smoking a pack of cigarettes every single day of your life.

Here, Marco Adinolfi (The leading researcher) explains more:

""Masturbating is more addictive than regular nicotine products and a session of masturbating will take exactly the same time for you to smoke a cigarette. The ejaculation process, however, is the bad thing of it. With it you ejaculate Vitamin C and D and other essential for the body vitamins. This is the reason for feeling down after ""fapping"" as you call it""

... ""I believe it is as bad as a pack of cigarettes. I urge people to stop doing it but at this current stage with little scientific evidence, many people believe that it is not harmful at all.""

&amp;#x200B;

Scientific evidence is proving it and all that delusional ""Fappers"" continue doing it. We, NoFappers chose the right way.

After taking up NoFap I can do things I couldn't do; for example: I started going out more and I found more reasons to be happy. This after just quitting my bad habit? Yes, and I feel better than ever. What about you?

Do you think of starting again? Better smoke a cigarette or two :)

I want this to be a motivational post so please add your reasons for starting NoFap or just a quote will help a person in need.

9046,Confession,I need some serious help. Just relapsed to hypnosis bullshit.,"Hello everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I really need some help. I need some advice, or something. I don't know what to do anymore. I had just finished a fantastic day. Back to work after a good weekend, college started again and I had the courage to go back after a year hiatus from anxiety attacks, and I went to the gym to drill down deadlift with a buddy, which was the lift that hurt me and made me take a month off. Overall, I just fucking killed it today. But i fucked it away, again. I've been on a chaser after relapsing after my 2nd best streak (13 days this time) and lately I have been dumb. But tonight I thought to myself that I was just going to peek.

&amp;#x200B;

What happened next is probably the most shameful thing I think I've done on this journey. For some god awful reason, I found out about hypnosis, and my mind was telling me, dude don't fucking do this. Well, now I have watched the video and all I can think about it porn. It's like it fucked my brain. I relapsed twice tonight. I am posting this on a second account because I'm so ashamed. I really don't know what to do anymore. It's like, every time I start to get a good streak I will fail and then relapse several times for weeks and sometimes months. Everything else is going well in my life but with NoFap I feel like a miserable failure and I keep thinking that maybe it's just always going to be like this. Maybe I'm just always going to be this husk of a man that can't even keep his impulses in check. I know that I shouldn't think this. I know that. But I can't help it. What I could really use is some advice, maybe from someone who has had a similar experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never really asked NoFap for help on this journey. I've always thought that I was strong enough to do it on my own. But right now, at 2 a.m. in the morning before my second day of school, I just want to reach out to someone or cry. Maybe both. I'm tired of this addiction guys.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you for those that reached out to me. If anyone is reading this, that hasn't looked into these types of videos, DON'T. After the experience, I spent several hours in a fucked up trance. I looked up some other people's experience, and I found [this.](https://www.nofap.com/forum/index.php?threads/beware-of-sissy-hypnosis.96845/) Mind you, that I didn't watch the same thing that this person did.

I am sure porn is the biggest reason why I am unmotivated, angry, unsociable, and 'tired of myself'. 
Even if porn isn't the actual problem i am certainly still blaming everything wrong on porn.

So, why am I treating PMO like just a small annoying habit that isn't doing much damage?
If you knew bitting your fingernails was the reason for everything bad about your life, you would go to extreme measures to avoid doing it again, right?

If im going to blame everything bad on porn then i need to at least treat it as the major problem I think it is.

This is my first Post on no fap community I just think that letting all the things that have been building up inside me to this community would help me to fight this fight more carefully without any Deviations or relapses.

I am suffering from a rare genetic disorder ducheen mascular dystrophy which effects the production of a protein called dystrophin whis is required for health muscel functioning and growth. I am wheelchair bound, basically all my muscles are slowly dying and i dont even know when its cure is going to be found.

I feel teribble as being a handicap person breaks you down physically and plus i am going down mentally because of PMO and have been fapping for about 4 years now, it took me 3 years to realize i was doing something wrong so then i found out about this community. I have been doing nofap since 1 year but i am still not abel to make it more than 15 days. But i dream of completing 4 years of no fap. I took my new year resolution to not fap but broke it just after 1 week into 2019 i feel terrible about this. But still i aim to keep moving.

Don't take this post as something negative and don't start thinking no fap isn't gonna help you out, it really does help you, i just wnated to let my feeling out and i want you guys to think about yourself that you are not alone in this fight, many people are facing problems in their life and many of the guys are having bad conditions than me but atleast you guys can walk and run and go anywhere you want to go on your own. You have a thing that someone does't so stop sitting in your room and go outside the discover the world.

9098,Journal Check-In,"Day 5 - relapse but not all lost, we oush on forward!","Firstly to clarify whilst I will be updating my counter if I relapse I will continue titling my journals day 5,6... to emphasise the fact this is an ongoing battle and whilst a relapse is a set back it does not mean all progress has been lost.

From my last blog I managed to get control of everything I intended to do, my phone gallery is cleared, laptop is blocked and a plan of action was set up.

I lasted 5 days without struggle, met up with my girlfriend and had a lovely night together. We had some fun and I managed to get hard so it was a successful evening. ( I do not count this as the relapse as in my personal journey I am allowing sexual pleasure with my partner)

The issue came the next morning when she left. I was still horny from sleeping with her all night and had unblocked Instagram for that period I was with her but forgot to block it again as soon as she left. So I ended up browsing and busting another nut. 

This is a set back but it has now been nearly a whole month of no porn and there has been no fetish induced orgasms. I would like to get to a point where all my orgasms come from pleasure brought to me by my girlfriend and I definitely think I am heading in that direction. Back to day 0 but unlike every other relapse I am not depressed or down, I acknowledge the setback and simply push on forward.

I have been busy the past few days due to exams but now they are over it will be easier to post on Reddit daily and also next time I get an urge I will summon my willpower and put my plan of action/no fap into action.

The things I need to do before next blog are :
- set up my weightlifting programme
- set up my cardio programme 

I hope you all have a lovely day!

9145,Motivation,Realistic Observations 7 days in,"As background I'm deep in this mess, only discovered the Nofap community last year and only managed an 11 day streak in November. I will be going 2019 with no PMO and no MO and want to record a weekly update of the benefits and also the lows, making this as real as possible and to hopefully motivate others. Note too, I'm a 40yo married man, have suffered PIED and been an addict for at least 20 years. Here goes:

1. After 7 days I feel good. Slightly more confident, more alert and stronger.

2. I'm enjoying the feeling of waking up in the morning knowing I've given myself the best chance of a decent sleep. In general I've been sleeping better.

3. I like that my browser history is clean and I have nothing to hide. It gives me inner peace and with less things to worry about.

4. I feel slightly less anxious at work and more ready to say hello and interact with people with a smile on my face. As a consequence I think people are responding to me more positively. It's a cycle.

5. I've not had many strong urges yet and feels like I've gone straight into a flatline but I'm okay with that. I don't mind the flatline, I'm using it to chalk 'easy days' onto the board. I also have a theory that the flatline can cause a brain trick in that people panic and then almost 'check' it still works. I'm not going to be tricked.

6. I've had more lucid dreams, not had any sexual ones, but my dreams are definitely more lucid and memorable. During PMO times I'm not even sure I dream.

7. I've been running more and enjoy running with the benefits of full sleep, feeling stronger and more determined to reach my goals.

8. I've started noticing how pretty my wife is.

The only slight negative I've had is dull headaches on day 4 and 5 which I presume were from withdrawal.

I'll start with the cons first.

•Feel sad / depressed
- That is something I am kinda happy about tho. Even when I was fapping, I was still feeling sad and depressed ( It's not all the time guys I'm totally fine). 
Just the moment I felt it, I went to fap and avoid the truth to hit me.

Literally my only con so far. I haven't had any urges to fap. Fuck masturbation.

Pros 

• Really Really confident  
• Way more energetic
• Way more motivated to do stuff 
• I finally started losing weight effectively
• I feel stronger?
• I feel **CLEAN**
• I feel transparent - I absolutely love this one
• I just feel like a better person in General!

Now, these pros sound about right. There could be a few more I can't think of right now.

But if this isn't enough to motivate you to keep going or to start NoFap, what is? Let yourself become the best version of you! Stay strong

9177,Motivate Me,"Over 100 days hardmode and I’ve never felt worse, told my wife about my struggle and she dismissed it","I’m in a bad place, in some ways worse than I started and I need help. 

I started this by admitting my addiction to porn nearly 5 months ago after 28+ years of slavery. I haven’t watched anything since then although I did fap once after about a month to see how I felt and it was very underwhelming which, I thought, was the best motivation to continue. Been sober ever since and for a little while I felt good. I made a very strict change to my diet and also quit smoking due to the fact that during that time I was also diagnosed with non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and wanted to really make a significant life change. 

It was nice to have a clean conscience and more time to do all of the important things I need to do in my busy job, father to two children under 3  years and trying to get recommitted to my marriage. I’ve never cheated, not even close but my addiction got to a place that it felt like it and that was my breaking point. I was fapping every day in my car in a ritualistic manner because I had no privacy in my house. I even got a second cell phone to be able to watch two screens at the same time. It was bad, I’m happy I quit, that much I can say. 

Due to my addiction and lack of interest in sex I also went an entire year without sex with my wife which I think we both attributed it to the birth of our second and the fact the baby was still sleeping in our room. They say baby omit a certain pheromone that reduces testosterone which became an easy cover. At any rate, I started the program and I assumed the change would continue to grow my confidence and urge for real sex and for a little while it did. 

I was trying to get to 90 days without orgasm though and since we hadn’t had sex for such a long time I didn’t even feel the need to tell my wife about it and I made it to 90 fairly easily. All I can say is I’ve been miserable now for a month at least and my marriage is at its lowest point. I’ve become more meek and when finally my wife worked up the courage to have a talk yesterday I couldn’t even look her in the eye. I thought, this is so weird since it is exactly the opposite of the results normally posted on here. I finally came out to her and told her about my struggle and what I was trying to accomplish. I explained it would have benefits for my immune system which is at this point the primary reason why I do it since my cancer affects immunity similar to HIV. 

She barely even reacted. She said, “well how much do you do it?” I explained it had probably been 5 times a week though I didn’t explain how much time I spent on it which would have been probably 12-15 hours a week. She said “well that sounds normal”. I didn’t really know how to react. I explained that this was a problem for me regardless and my plan was to quit it entirely to get committed more to our relationship. I think she was happy to hear that and we both felt better to have communication which was sorely lacking. Still I was surprised and a little disappointed. I feel like I need an outlet. Maybe depression medication to boost my feeling of wellness? I think masturbation was a form of self medication for me. Has anyone else had issues that required medication supplement?

9181,Advice to NoFap,3 rules to reduce relapses,"1. Take it day by day.
   I see a lot of people relapsing on December 31st, and then setting the goal of going 365 days without p.m.o.  that is not good to do, you need to live in this present moment, that's all you have.  I am only on day 15 but I feel good about everyday because I am constantly saying to myself; I made it through day 14, so I can make it through day 15, 16, 17, 18.  But I don't get too far ahead of myself.  Stay strong in this present moment.
2. Stay Busy/ get out of your room.
    I would highly recommend doing high intensity exercising in the morning and wake up earlier than usual.  The first principle ties into this one too.  Say if I exercised yesterday, I have the strength to exercise again today.  If I read for 3 hours yesterday, why would I allow a weak mindset to have me not remain consistent in the things that are going to make me the strongest.  
3. (Most important). Plan for your moments of weakness.
    These are all important, but a lot of overcoming this addiction is a mental game.  A lot of people don't really know exactly why they meditate, they know it has brain benefits, but the reason you should do it daily and a lot, is so that you can start to recognize as soon as you have a sexual thought, image, or fantasy appear in your mind.  You have to shake your head and say no, no that's not what I want anymore.  And redirect your thought process.  If you don't feed the fantasy, then your urges are going to become weaker and weaker, and meditation helps a lot with this.
4. (Bonus) Learn about the nature of all addictions.
   Your brain is so used to getting a surge of dopamine and other feel good motivating chemicals.  Because of this fact, when you deny this stimuli to even the roots(your thoughts).  You have to recognize that the brain will send you tons of chemicals that will make you feel bad, and in this sadness(weakness) is where you will rationalize the idea of porn.  So it is at this point where it is most important to stay even a little busy, because you are at the weakest, but your will power will continue to grow.  
I have relapsed a lot in the past, but with these principles, everytime I get back up.  Everytime I improve upon my previous streaks.  Stay strong people.  Greatness will come to all of us on this journey!",41,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adugps/3_rules_to_reduce_relapses/
9188,New to NoFap,Starting a streak,"Hello guys,  
I never posted much on this community but after many failed attempts at NoFap I realised I cannot do it without your support. I am starting a streak today and I am really motivated. I was just wondering if anyone can tell me what to expect or if you have any tips on what I should do in order to have a successful streak. Thanks guys",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aduolf/starting_a_streak/
9191,Telling my Story,So I'm past my previous longest streak now - honest report,"I started doing NoFap in October 2018. I fapped about six times one day and I was so horribly depressed the next day that I was afraid I would do something stupid. I soon discovered porn was the main problem. I was way more addicted to porn than to fapping. I couldn't even fap without it.

In the beginning I had streaks ranging from 4-7 days. I kissed 4-5 different girls while going out (which is the same number of girls I kissed the past 4 years). They al wanted to have sex but I was either too nervous or too stupid to notice the signal. 

When I was on my previous 15 day streak, a girl from my band kissed me out of the blue. She begged me to go home with her, but I didn't. We slept together about ten times, but it wasn't great so I almost ended up watching porn and fapping when she went home again. Pathetic, I know. 

When I had urges I would do something useful, or in the evening, taking a drink, which is of course a horrible solution. However I'm doing dry January now, and I'm not tempted to drink and not tempted to fap. I had a sex dream tonight in which I orgasmed, but when I woke up there was no mess. I'm happy I didn't fap right then. 

Conclusion: nofap has been hard, but the streaks get easier. I get used to it. I completely stopped smoking months ago during nofap, and it seems the booze goes out the window next. I'm pretty introvert (INFP in the MBTI model) but nofap melts away social anxiety. The girls I hook up with all approached me. 
Tonight I have a party. I will not drink and I will not fap beforehand. 

I'd like to thank you all. This stuff works. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adurii/so_im_past_my_previous_longest_streak_now_honest/

In all honesty, I'm trying to stay positive but I'm really starting to doubt that NoFap is helping. I'm tempted to go back to MO'ing but I'm afraid that it'll backfire and make things worse than they already are. 

I'm also thinking of starting on Viagra/Cialis to see if it will help. If the medication works, I think I can get a boost in confidence to the point where I won't need them anymore.

I have some great news to you all! To those who already know about what I'm going to talk and as we to those who may not yet have had the chance to experience it themselves, I tell you this:

There's is no bull$hit about no fap, omg! Guys, I am saying this with all my heart. It really made me more controlling of my life and I am happy like never.

What's even better is that from my joy of this new control in my life I don't even experience urges.

I am doing only cold showers and they're not that hard like I remember. Every cold shower adds me character and I keep on getting stronger. If this continuous, I may become One Punch Man and you can too!

Doing push-ups everyday helps me as well, tremendously I may add.

Finally, this is really the best thing I have done for the well being of myself. If you are skeptic about this, don't be. Just try it! You'll see the plethora of benefits from it:
1) More Confident
2) More Energy
3) Sharper intellect

Those are only the tip of the iceberg.

9414,Journal Check-In,How can I check my streak?,"Hi ^^

First, I’m sorry if I do this wrong, it’s the first time I’m writing a “Journal” .-.

Anyway, I’m actually doing pretty well and the actual reason I’m writing this is cuz I want to check my streaks and I didn’t just wanted to write “Hey” soo: 
Hey ^^
As said I am pretty good right now and didn’t had any real problems today. My whole streak period is pretty self-running at the moment and I’m kinda worried that it’s the calm before the storm.... have any of you guys experienced sth. similar?
Also I started “cold showering” and it’s wayy easier than I thought. I guess I just didn’t liked the name that why I came up with a new one: “Anti-Hot Showering!” Imo way more descriptive, cuz for some reason I always felt that it’d be like some sort of ice bucket challenge, whereas (for me at least) it’s just not turning the shower all the way hot always and than slowly go colder throughout the shower as far as you can. And I feel like it is part of what makes it really easy right now. 
Another thing might be that I had wisdom teeth surgery right after Xmas and It was hurting for like a week and i basically couldn’t do anything anyway.. I’ll take it :D (btw, u r also not allowed to drink alc. or coffee so mby that helped my brain chem. as well?)

I guess that’s all I have to say for now.. it’s actually quite relieving and I feel even better now :DD

9428,Journal Check-In,Day 1: Breaking the Cycle,"I have explained my situation in a somewhat esoteric manner in [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/adyndj/the_cycle_an_esoteric_way_of_looking_at_porn/). The gist of it is that upon starting a new streak, I am determined and hold tightly to the understanding that pornography is an overwhelmingly negative force in my life. However, as time goes on, I lose sight of that simple truth, before eventually my urges get the better of me. Once I relapse, my disappointment and disgust remind me of the importance of quitting this addiction.

It is truly a viscous cycle for me, but I have a better plan to break out of it now. In addition to the things that I already have set up / am doing, namely...

* porn blockers
* meditation
* free-weight exercises
* walk in nature everyday
* cold showers
* emergency resort to fapping without porn, in the case of extreme urges

...I will be adding the following to my daily routine:

* visit /r/NoFap and read trough the first 5-10 serious, non-image posts
* write a journal entry specifically addressing your current struggle and progress with quitting pornography
* regularly post the more interesting journal entries to /r/NoFap

9446,Journal Check-In,Day 1,"Yes. Day 1. Again.

I've had a terrible start to the month. Relapsed three times in January already... no other month since I started logging has 3 slips before the 8th!

BUT the flimsy justification I can put forward (yes, I recognise this *is* justification) is that I've pushed myself out of my comfort zone more then ever over the last week too.

It's not an excuse, but I think it's likely to be a reason... I still haven't balanced that anxiety yet.

And it's been a kick up the rear to actually get serious about recovery.

My last record month (December) had 7 slips all month. That gives me only 3 left if I'm going to make a new record. And none, of course, if I'm going to live my higher purpose.

The plan...

Use my discomfort and irritation to grow myself. See the amazing opportunity for growth within the urges. Focus less on the problem and more on the growth that's being offered to me.

9468,Other,[long] New method towards approaching PMO recovery?,"Here's what I realized today after relapsing: Setting a challenging, long-term goal such as not fapping again, ever, will rarely work, at least not for me. I'm guessing that 90%+ of nofappers who committed to never fapping again, relapsed within 90 days on their first attempt. I believe the recovery process needs to be broken down into more manageable chunks to ensure a higher likelihood of long-term success (again, if you reading this are able to go from fapping everyday to never again, that's great). These progressive benchmarks should gradually get my brain used to the idea of fapping less and less. In addition, relapsing on planned dates should condition my brain to not follow through on my desires whenever I feel like fapping, increasing my self control. This may or may not also help with reducing anxiety and guilt after relapsing, knowing that the relapse was planned.

Following these principles, here is my plan that I will be following over the next couple of months to ensure my ultimate goal of never relapsing again:

going 7 days without fapping starting today, planning to relapse in exactly 7 days from now or a day or two later depending on how I feel
2 weeks without fapping following the initial 7-day period
either 30 or 45 days after the 2-week period
full 90 days following 30-45 day abstinence period, check-in after 90 days have elapsed, aim to continue forever after this
Long-term success should be prioritized over seeing quick results and life improvements. 

If anyone has any suggestions or ideas please share. Good luck everyone.

9524,Telling my Story,NoFap didn't give me superpowers.,"I'm writing this as I'm inside a blocked train for countless minutes. The title is pretty clickbait-y but if you keep reading, you'll read the story of mine and why I did commence this lifestyle in the first place. 

Some of you may have notice me as I commented on several posts but I never actually posted here before. I have heard about noFap for several months but never really tried it because I never felt addicted to pornography or masturbation in the first place, because I read about people going for 5+ times fapping a day and 10+ hours of porn per week, I was far from being in this state (I'm not judging, but I kept making excuses). I'm currently 25, finished my studies one year ago, and have a good starting job, so money isn't a problem for me. I guess I'm lucky to be in this situation, so I cannot complain, after all there are people who are homeless, starving or maybe worse. 

But still... There is something inside me that felt ""off"".  I don't feel *genuine* and feeling no gratitude and acknowledgment, I should but I don't, why ? Is there a reason behind this ? I question myself almost constantly, rarely letting my mind to rest or focusing on a task. Given my situation, I could use many tools to help answering my question ""who am I"", using mainly the internet to find my answer, scrolling through forums, watching countless Ted Videos and articles about self-improvement; I have learned so much. It wasn't wasted, the more I searched, the more I understand myself.

YouTube is pretty strong about showing one recommended videos; for months YouTube showed me recommended videos about porn, masturbation studies and later on NoFap. But I didn't click any of them yet. Until one day, a YouTuber I eagerly follow uploaded an off topic video, where he talks about his lifestyle changes, and noFap. The way he told his story was actually genuine and made me willing to listen through the end. It was my first wake-up call; starting cold showers, dieting (tried intermittent fasting first but failed), and even exercising like the YouTuber said. The latter was the hardest because I have the ""clubfoot"" deformity plus very thin legs so I'm fragile down there, and later I did check up my legs and learned that I have osteoarthritis on my  feet. It made me depressed hard, and this was my second wake-up call. I missed so much in my life, restraining myself because of this handicap and associated negativity towards it, I even thought that I don't deserve to be loved, convinced that love is forbidden to me because I'm a monster. 

But the more I made progress, the more I was irritated, why can't I still feel genuine ? I took my life back, having a healthier routine and all, hell I even started to play violin as an autodidact ? Having no answer to give, I started to give up one by one extra activities, my days were the same, wake up to go to work, come back to home, go back to sleep, sometimes I played some video games but I didn't feel any Joy to do so though I'm a gamer (quite outdated one). Dieting ? What for ? I'm worthless, and I won't know love anyways, why bother ? Cold showers, meh I prefer hot ones, exercising ? I'm hurt after two minutes. Violin ? Let me laugh, I failed before I started, I know you won't be good, so I gave up.

I was clueless about my state, there's no way it is normal, I kept searching and I heard about HFD (High Functioning Depression), it was incredibly accurate how this disorder described me, especially the part where you keep going to work and work hard because you are hiding your worthlessness. I always lacked self-esteem and confidence, in fact it is VERY low. At the very least I don't follow social media that promotes fake lives (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), only Reddit if you count it as a social media. hFD disorder was still in my mind, what if I have this ? Hell no, I can't, look at my life, everything is ok for me, right ? 

Moving on, I keep my dark thoughts for me because I felt no one would understand anyway. Each time I talked to my siblings, I always ended being the listener, plus I need to be strong for them, I am the most balanced according to them after all, gotta keep this way. Friends ? Well, I don't have much of them, but I admire the few people that I consider as friends, but rarely talk about me... Because they may judge me and reject me ? No, it's because I don't want to disappoint them, I don't want them to see that I'm a fake and actually a piece of shit, remember,  gotta hide my dark thoughts. 

My life goes on, working harder not to be better, no. I'm bad, utterly bad. But I work hard to hide that I'm bad, and fake among my peers at work. But recently, I felt into a severe apathy state, though I started to do meditation regularly and before that, yoga. Why the hell, after all of that... For nothing !? All those wake-up calls were fake !? Am I this worthless !? Well... 
There was two choices, either it is a yes and I give up because I can't seem to be genuine no matter how hard I try, or yes but I will fight to turn the tide and live for real. Is there something I kept doing without giving up at the end ??

This is where my last wake-up call occured... All this time, since the age of 15... There was this one thing, one fucking thing I kept doing this whole time. P.M.O. that one thing I never really gave up. This feeling of instant, intense self gratification after a long day, after a long week of work, whenever you feel sad, empty and I can keep up saying similar words, but I think you mean what I mean. This is when I went to my corner of memories, and realized how much I never gave up PMO, it was even more present than my family, my friends, PMO is a witness of my true self, the piece of shit I really am. It was enough though, I understood that this drained me to the core, it changed me to the point that I no longer know who I am, it thrives on your weaknesses. So i decided to subscribe to this subreddit, scrolling down to get a grasp on how the community works. I saw many day 0/1 posts, and some of them telling how NoFap is hard and so on. But I was decided to start this lifestyle this community is praising, this is probably the last thing I give up for good. And it is in hard mode (no PMO), but since I'm virgin, no sex as well. 

Fast forward to today, I'm glad that I made this far, and still going on, especially thanks to this subreddit (alone sure but not lonely at the end). That, along with meditation, was my new starter pack to this lifestyle. I'm including little by little new habits and former healthy habits like cold showers, intermittent fasting, calisthenics (doing without forcing hard on my legs and feet), maybe later yoga, writing stories, and ultimately violin (I need to fix the cords first). I didn't give up video games, but because of work I did put it aside... I started again recently to play and it feels genuinely good but I overall reduce the time spent playing videogames to keep this freshness.

So wait, all this wall of text ? Why the title isn't fitting it ? Let me tell you something, NoFap itself didn't give me anything at all, and superpowers are a no-no. BUT, starting the NoFap lifestyle was surely my greatest genuine decision I have ever take. It was not because I watched or heard motivational content, this time, it was real, it is the first time I feel genuinely connected to myself. No gave that to me; I found it by myself, I'm truly awaken now.

So before starting NoFap, ask yourself if your reason behind it is genuine, are you ready to give up this one thing that never let you down (PMO) even in the hardest times ? Do you think you are happy ? Are you genuinely connected to yourself ? Can you hear your heart beat, can you hear your breath and overall your body ? Can you sense your inner feelings and thoughts ? This, is my reason behind all of this. Starting NoFap allows me to continue my journey started since September 2015 on understanding my true self and my true potential. Finally, I feel alive, human again but what's even more interesting, is that it is not the end, it is the beginning ! 

Thank you all for reading this tremendous wall of text, I hope you recall your purpose and what brought you in this subreddit in the first place.

Imagine when you die, you get the chance to watch your life from a outside your body (you can't skip or fast forward - you kinda watch it all in a slightly fast forwarded speed in the moment that you are about to die) 

Think about the amount of time you have to watch yourself looking at porn &amp; jerking off in  your youth...what will you see? What will you hear? How will you feel? 

And in general, as you think about this life movie -

What are the moments you will be proud of? And what are the moments you will absolutely hate yourself for indulging? 

Why nor start living in a manner that you will be proud of watching your own life movie now? 

We tend to forget when we live out our daily lives that we are part of a bigger grand scheme called life and just how precious our time is when death is put into perspective.

9583,Relapse Report,I'm suffering from my own cell.,"Hello guys! a loser here, he broke his 11 day streak just by living alone in the house. I don't know what the problem to me maybe i'm just too addicted to video games so i end up seeing things that  i might not see during reboot. Or i'm just too lazy to make myself more productive and stop thinking about **fapping**. I relapsed watch some 3d hentai something,Masturbated at 2d pixel women and now i feel so down afterwards. **I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE FUCKING PROBLEM TO ME**! why i can't be the others who succeed? maybe what i'm suffering now is just too small to what they experience. I still have advantages i think because every time i'm about to relapse (maybe) god sends some anything that stop me from relapsing like my mom suddenly came etc. God want to help me but i cant help myself. I believe on him. He is my greatest buddy to succeed what i want. He help my but i don't notice the things he's doing for me. I know my goal! i know what i want and i know what things i might encounter but i still falling in a obvious trap. Maybe its just how i live. I woke up eat, laying around playing games, go to school, go home, eat, play games again, sleep and repeat. I know its too bad for a person how want to reboot its like i'm helping the hunter to make a trap for me. Does the only way is to isolate me from gadgets and do things with my own hand? I know that i'm addicted because i don't want to outdated to memes, animes, and games but if this is the only way... No, who i'm kidding i know i will fell again in a obvious trap but i can't because this things are the things that make me happy. They are out of the things that cause urges right? **NO, yes** they are. I just notice too that is this challenge cause stress because i want to be my greatest me, **the almighty Saint Exorcist** but i think it is just a dream that will never happen if i keep downing myself and keep taking poison that i think make myself happy but the reality is not. Or maybe the cause of stress is i want to be my greatest me **now.** I read many story and they said that they take a lot of time to succeed. Maybe i just let the creator decide what and when i'm gonna be but in the other way i don't want to lay down myself and wait for a miracle to drop. Are you experiencing this? the thing that you realized yourself caught in the middle of two things like "" It**'s not the time yet to begin let god decide when**"" and ""**Nothing will happen if we don't do anything**"". you know what i mean? I don't know if i just let the flow or contradict the flow and make my own way. I don't know i'm not just a loser, also a confused men who don't know what he's doing. I think this is the reason why i'm so stressed. I'm always overthinking stuffs. I want to get a high grade but what i am dong? nothing and then when i get a low score i find something to blame and make them as a excuse. Maybe because i'm not to afraid to lie so i don't realized that i'm lying  to myself many years ago since i discovered that... i don't what to accept it but i'm jealous of what people done. **PLEASE help guys** i know where i want to go but there is a blind fold in my eyes.

9586,Journal Check-In,My 2019 Journey - Beginning,"So I'm starting my 2019 journey today, perhaps a little bit later than most but that can't be helped at this point, and what is done is done. I have built up a substantial network of neural pathways, over what I estimate to be approximately a decade (started somewhere around age 12). Unfortunately I was unaware of the damage both reversible and irreversible I was doing to myself over this time period, up until about 2 years ago. From that point onwards I have learned much and have failed spectacularly hundreds of times. Unfortunately as a newly trained biochemist with a keen sense for human psychology I can't help but notice the insurmountability of the task at hand, and can't help but despair at the lasting damage I have done to myself.

I tried to end 2018 in style but tripped up just before new years eve. Even though I have lived the past year in a constant state of incentive salience against PMO, this has only promoted the formation of a steep incentive sensitization pathway. This pathway releases powerful hits of dopamine when I simply browse social media or youtube (both of which I typically avoid anyway, but check occasionally for the benefits seeking real socialization opportunities), due to the possibly of my finding a way from point A to porn (which has been the cause of pretty much all my recent relapses). Now anything that used to be easy to brush off sends a signal of dopamine wanting me to chase down possible leads. Yikes.

I started 2018 on here as I thought it would be helpful but at the time I was at a different point in my recovery journey and was not yet ready for the easily available explicit content just a few clicks away. Now I'm back as I believe it will be a useful tool combined with my newly acquired experience and knowledge. I'm hoping to rob the power of my incentive sensitization pathway by consciously thwarting every little whiff of it by turning my attention to Satanama mediation (a powerful tool for exercising concentration and diverting conscious attention), for the next 8 weeks starting from today. Of course this 8 weeks without PMO will also help break down the big main baddies as well, although I anticipate a much longer road to recovery from those bad boys. So yeah I'll basically be posting on here every now and then when I feel it's necessary, and going to browse every night for 30 minutes as part of my nightly routine, hopefully I'll be able to give some helpful advice during that time to those who seek it.

9624,Confession,Relapsed with too much on the line,"So I relapsed, after having told myself that I was going to be clean for the whole of 19. It was ambitious and now I realise I should have been taking it day by day. 
I know why I relapsed, I was fantasizing about a girl who I'd been on date a week with a week or two ago whilst I was on my longest streak and we hit it off pretty well. Anyway fantasizing led to the NSFW subreddits and one thing led to another and I felt disgust in myself and what was on my screen. 

Although it isnt all doom and gloom, up until a few months I PMO'd around 3 times a week and sometimes more. For years I didnt know about nofap or that PMO made me feel like utter shit, turned me from the most confident person in the room to the guy who hoped no one spoke to him, the student which every teacher thought would be studying at top universities and isnt, the guy who feels depressed and sometimes suicidal about his situation. I really wish I found the sub reddit years ago and I think I'd be better on in life.

However, it isnt all terrible. I've gone from PMO'ing from at least 3 times a week to PMO'ing twice a month. I've have the opportunity to study my dream subject at uni and have a good chance of getting accepted to study it. I've started going to the gym and it's being noticed by more and more people. Now after a relapse I dont fall into a cycle for days on end, instead I just get back on nofap and try not to make the same mistake that led me to relapse, however whenever I take a day off from the gym the urges become stupidly strong. So if anyone has any tips for how to keep them at bay it would be much appreciated.

But I know i cant get onto my dream course unless I quit PMO for good. I know why I relapsed today, I didnt do any physical activity. Not even push ups but I hadnt taken a day off for over a week and all of that energy just got flushed out of my system instead of being used to study. And if I cant be successful in my studies I wont be able to get on with life. I have around 8 months from now until I have to take an entrance exam which will most likely shape my life and I have to be clean. I've been trying since September for 3 months and I havent even reached a single month. Max I got was 27 days. So close yet so far.

Sorry If that was too long, I had to get it off my chest.

A few questions 

After 90 days how do you guys feel compared to when you were fapping?
I know superpowers are just you, the old you but what does it feel like? 
How does memory improve? 
I know first hand confidence greatly improves from past streaks. 
Also, on longer streaks I find I can lift heavier weights, is that just a mental block or to do with more energy from not fapping?

Bit of a long shot, but would anybody be willing to be my accountability partner?

Well first month went well, started talking to a girl. But I felt somewhat uncomfortable since .y wind would sometimes trigger some sex fantasies in class or outside and couldn't get them out( boners in class too) and sex fantasies a out the girl which ruined my confidence

actually got asked to accomany in a homecoming with my sisters freind. Went great. No problem

Started to talking more girls as the plan for no.4

Although I didn't want random sex thoughts In the middle of class



****all of this was before nofap""********
I probably got my confidence due to me exercising

After nofap

Started hard

Strong urges at day 15-26(November 2018)
This all felt to easy and it was my 2nd try on nofap( last time I tried was in January 2018)

Things went well after those days
..

After 45... I just let go of the thought and would now and then check because all I knew was that in January 5th was gonna be my 90th day

So here is some changes

Talking with girls seems effortless( although sometimes I don't have not much to say but that's another thing)

More focus since I don't think of sex

No more "" aww can't fucking wait for English class to end so I can go home and Jerk off""

No more"" so what will I watch on porn hub today""?"" Can't WAIT!""

I think nofap really just rewires your brain into focusing into what you want

And girls that look all sexy.... When I see their pants .....I just see pants ( if that makes sense 😁)

I shall reach planet 180th

Although social skills is still in work in progress, but that's what you get for not socializing much at childhood... I do remember when I started this school year I was like ""just keep practicing you'll get better"" well I am better than I was before

So what happend in my year 2018? To say in one sentence, it was my worst year in my life YET. Except for my spiritual experiences and of course my great friends and enormous family, the only highlight this year was the release of Red Dead Redemption 2. That's it. I can not remember a year, in which I really thought, that I was happy, that the year ended. 
But 2018 didn't start bad at all. Until February I cannot remember good or bad things. But in February I had my first great spiritual experience. Now I have to mention my mom, who had been diagnosed with cancer in 2016. She had been fighting and kept strong since then. And this whole time has been really hard for all of us (my dad, brother, all the uncles, aunts and cousins). But we kept faith (unintentional joke) all the time and it kept us from collapsing. That does not mean, we hadn't moments, in which we broke down. In 2017 my mom was so desperate with what will happen to her and when this all will end. So she prayed and asked, and just heard a quiet voice saying an odd number. And somehow this odd number calmed her down. It is weird, that a number calms someone down and kind of answers the question about life and death, so we interpreted this as a sign by god, that she will live this odd numbers years. Back in Feburary 2018, my uncle visited us for the ""anointing of the sick""-ceremony. Not only the sick gets anoited, but also, we should forgive ourselves (in this case, my mom, my dad, my brother and me). And oh boy did we all cry while forgiving each others. And this ceremony was so surreal. Later that February, we managed to gather almost all family members for a big party for our oldest aunt. We are talking about 60 peoples, children included. It was also a great experience for my mom, because she loves our big family. And being able to see them in her state put a really big smile on her face. Also in Feburary, I had my first exams in the university. I studied informatics. Two out of three exams were passed, only the mathematics one was failed. However, I still have three more attempts for this exam. So not a big deal at all.
But now we come to the part, where 2018 went downhill... really down from a really big hill. In March, my mom had to go to a hospital 200km away from us, because they treat her and are specialized with her form of cancer. As usual, during her stay, we phoned two times daily. After some days of her stay, she reports, that she barely sleeps and has problems with eating, almost impossible for her to eat. And in the end of March, after one or two weeks, she finally arrived at home. Still unable to sleep and eat. Anything she ate, she immediately drew up. In this days, I had to write the mathematics exam a second time. This time, I failed the test real close. Still, I had to pass the test. That means, I have to write the exam next year. This was the first kind of small step down the hill. But oh boy, did I not know, that the next few days had a big surprise with me. At home, we had my mom, who started to ask again, when all the suffering would end. And I could only say, that we have to hope, that'll get better. When she asked, when it's going to be, I could only answer with ""I don't know"". This not even a full week she's been home was one of her hardest times. Never did she suffer more than then. And so did we. It became that bad, that she had to go to the hospital again, this time in our city. So we were able to visit her everyday. And everyday she became weaker. With not being able to sleep and eat, she became that evening a little mad, when the doctors couldn't help her. They somehow managed to give her some medicine for sleeping. It worked. The next day my dad visited her shortly, while I was at my job for financing the university. He reported, that she tried to sleep, but noticed him. I was kind of happy, because I thought, that she now gets a little sleep, get better and maybe be able to eat normally again. We planned to visit her at 6pm. But we ended up coming earlier.
The doctors called. My brother answered. My dad told me to get ready, to drive to the hospital. As I was ready and left the room I saw my brother and I knew what was going to happen. I looked in his eyes and they were red. I tried myseld to calm down and say, that she'll survive odd numbers years. On our way, I noticed, our dad was kind of nervous. As we reached the door, we saw two nurses in blue scrubs, face masks and that weird green head gear. I know, where I saw the last time this kind of outfit. It was, when my mom and my aunt visited our kind of grandmother in the hospital. She was dying.
And so I hoped, that this was just coincidence. But as soon as I entered my mom's room, I knew what was going on and my eyes turned into an ocean. Seeing her lying there, having that breath that dying people have (surprisingly I cannot remember this sound but I was never that terrified in my life). Still at least hoping for a last moment miracle. In the end, I said my oldest cousin, that she should contact all our family members (I know she got all the contacts). The first members arrived when she died. We were in this room for over 5 hours and waited for members to come even over 200kms far away. As my oldest cousin with her parents arrived, I remembered the odd number. And I checked the date and it was the odd number's day of March. I think, if I hadn't remembered this I would've been stopping to go to our church. 
With this worst day of my life, I did not only lost a Mother, but also a good, the best friend and a person I could almost tell anything. Only one week later university started again. During this week, our family has been a big help. 
And this second semester will take every last nerve out of me. I ended up not continuing mathematics. And still I messed up the other two informatics subjects. Both exams were failed. I didn't even try the second exams, because of this kind of mental breakdown. In summer, we had a three week practical course and I was really struggling. I even questioned myself, if I was good enough for informatics. At the end of the second week I had this mental breakdown, where I was crying but had no idea why. I just tried to accomplish the tasks for the practical course, but I ended up trying to end this internal fight. It is hard to describe. I can only say, that I have experienced it a second time. But this experience led to my decision to stop studying and start an apprenticeship in informatics.
While the year was halfway through (actually only 4 months left), I have survived the hardest part of 2018. And not even football (soccer) was that great, witnessing Germany's worst World cup in history (at least it was an entertaining tournament). Now I had to apply for next years apprenticeship place. I found two places but ended up only applying for one. At this time, the highlight happened. Later, I was invited for a test and then in December for a job interview. I thought it was a good interview and waited for a response and the week before Christmas, I got the response. And, as 2018 went, I got rejected. Frustrated about everything, I decided to stay at home and don't go to work (I still have that mini job).
And at home, during Christmas, we had to renovate our bath, because the neighbors thought, we had water damage. Turns out, everything was fine. However we were able to change the pipes and adjust our shower. Still, it was getting on my nerve. At the end, the tip of the Iceberg, I catched a cold, did not recover properly and caught another cold a week ago.

With a fresh 2019, I hope that I will start to be able, to turn this year into a positive year and therefore to undo 2018.

TL;DR My mom died, which was a real hard time. Also I stopped studying and got rejected from an apprenticeship. All in 2018. I think, that's why I ended up here and hope, to succeed.

And similar knives and forks they use,
With similar laces they tie their shoes,

You can triumph and come to skill,
You can be great if only you will,

You have legs and arms and a brain to use,

Began his life with no more than you.

You are the one who must choose your place,
You must say where you want to go.

God has equipped you for life, But He
Lets you decide what you want to be.

Courage must come from the soul within,
The man must furnish the will to win,

10070,Other,"""May it be""","So I've been unable to hold a streak for a while now and I was listening to the Lord of the Rings soundtrack to help me sleep when the song May It Be by Enya came on. It's a beautiful and relaxing song, and I reccomend it to everybody here because it offers a lot of insight and motivation. 
There's one line in particular I'd like to focus on. It's near the end when she sings, ""when the night is overcome you may rise to find the sun.""
Every line that she sang I tried to put in perspective with my current situation and this one stuck out the most. I found the lyric odd, because the way it rubbed me was, ""hide under a rock until the bad things pass, *then* you can come out and do the good things."" This isn't really a view I would have with Frodo and certainly not one I'd like to have with myself. But after some thought it began to make a little more sense abd become quite inspirational. 
The way I take it now is like this. It's not telling us to hide then get going while the going is convenient. It's saying that before you start chasing after the sun (I.e holding a streak, comparing your physical features to how they used to be or using that magic charm we all seem to get) we need to fight away the darkness. This could be turning off your electronics an hour before you go to bed, if you're religious maybe that means praying more or attending church meetings more often, telling people you trust that you need help, keeping a journal about your struggles or just admitting that you need to start getting on top of things. 
If you try to go ""finding the sun"" before you've beat down the darkness you'll more than likely fail and be discouraged. You've got to find your way through the darkness and then you can go find the sun. 

I hope this helped someone. Just an interesting thought that I felt someone might need to hear. You guys are great and I'm proud of everybody fighting! You've all got this!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ae55a8/may_it_be/

Still going strong with my NoNut19 journey, and I thought I'd pose a question to you:  what's the hardest thing you've had to let go since starting your journey?  I'll start telling mine in story form.

There was this girl that I saw on Tinder who went to the same University as me about a year or two ago.  I never actually met her in person, but she ended up becoming my one of my biggest fantasies and I ended up following her Instagram since it was linked in her Tinder.  She ended up appearing in my dreams, and my parents always taught me to follow those (ba dum tiss).

Anywho, since starting NNN I've deleted my online dating apps and unsubscribed from other forms of erotica, but I wasn't able to bring myself to unfollow this girl until this morning.  If I'm being completely realistic, I'm probably never going to meet her in person unless I become a stalker, and I have enough issues as it is.  I'm pretty sure I'm not her type any way but that's beside the point; the sooner I forget about her the better.

IME, monk mode accelerates progress much faster than normal mode. Anytime I get a sexual thought, I immediately shut it down, reaffirm myself that ""I do not have sexual thoughts"" a couple times, and imagine the sexual energy rising upwards into the head. Works pretty well for me.

Well, it's just day one, so nothing too special. I feel pretty good, though a little lethargic and unmotivated. Probably because of the dopamine withdrawal that happens during the first few days. I'll be doing this daily to keep reminding myself of the goal. Stay tuned! ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ae8ifh/monk_mode_day_1/

10246,Journal Check-In,Why do I cheat? - Week 1 Update,"My first week on NoFap has opened my eyes to just how strong the addiction to PMO can be.  When I started a week ago, my main concern was to eliminate all masturbation -- I assumed that if I could cut out the M, I'd have no desire for P.  Man, was I wrong.  Even though I've managed my urges to masturbate and have abstained from those actions, I still find myself wrestling with daily urges to look at porn.  A little look here or there, just a peek while alone in my room or in the bathroom, anything to get that tiny hit of dopamine.  I have strict restrictions set on all my devices to help keep me from looking at porn, but man those urges are strong.

Does anyone else experience this?  Am I right in hoping that the longer I abstain from masturbation, the weaker those cravings for porn will get?  I'm thankful I haven't broken my streak yet, but I know it's cheating if I cave in and look at porn, even without masturbating.  How have others managed these withdrawal cravings?

Hoping for a breakthrough and some renewed strength as I pass the 1 week mark.  Much love to you fighters, thank you for the encouragement!",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ae8qx6/why_do_i_cheat_week_1_update/

What I mean is, constantly looking at your flair or always looking through this subreddit and others like pornfree. Obviously look at it for motivation when you’re going through a rough spot, but don’t have nofap on your mind at all times.

10303,Confession,I think i have never had a true crush because Of PMO(regrets),"This may seem off topic but it's what I realised in my reboot and I want to confess this.

Now that my brainfog is clearing, its one of those things that has been running through my mind and has kept me up all night for the past few days. So my story in a nutshell, i am now 17, i started MO at 12 and PMO at 15, I found and started nofap since october of last year. 

(The rest of this content may make me come off as creepy but trust me i am not a creep anymore, i was just massively antisocial and confused when i used to do this)

I never had a girlfriend before and barely any girls in my circle, which i can accept. But all the girls i have ever had a crush on, i never really got the feelings or thingies i read or hear in other people's stories, those stories being other people in my class or my friends getting in a relationship. And its very common for teenagers to have crushes and getting into relationships. But not me, i think i just felt the lust and like not actual attraction to the person inside. What i saw was a pretty girl and i have sexual attraction to her, thats it, i just MOed at that point thinking about her. 

Yes I am one of those kids, and i now realise how horrible it is and i feel very ashamed, i dont know what to do about it, and this feeling of how i have been objectifying them and how rude it is to MO fantasizing to people is eating me alive. And i just want to get out of this hole. For the last 4 months i have discontinued to do that and now I realise how pathetic it is. 

Now the real reason I am writing this post, I wanted to confess how negatively PMO has affected my life and how I am struck with FOMO (or fear of missing out) where everyone of my friends is in a relationship or atleast can feel those teenage romantic feelings called crushes whereas I am here recovering from an addiction which is going to take years. Basically a fear that I may not be able to have a real crush on someone anytime soon, where I actually want to know who they are, where I get excited to hear their name, or have a relationship with them. Also for someone with 0 social skills or knowledge, it's hard for me to even think about what a true relationship is and what people do. I understand hardcore science, math and logic, even fantasies and fiction like novel franchises etc cetra, but I don't know what a relationship is.

So for anyone who read the whole ramblement, what can I do in a situation where I have no clue what a crush is and I want to have a crush on someone to know what it is like before I turn 18 next month. Or atleast tell me what a crush actually feels like.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ae9pdf/i_think_i_have_never_had_a_true_crush_because_of/

10399,Advice to NoFap,The correct way to use your sexual energy,"Hello Fapstronauts! I’ve been struggling since last winter with all the tension and energy built by the streaks , the few things that brought me balance were maditation , swimming and running, but if I wasn’t able to do this stuff it was gonna be the end, tension would have increased and I would have ended up relapsing, thinking that all that energy was useless. I am currently on a two weeks streak (as if it possible to call it that way) and I finally got out from one of the worst period of my journey in which I Masterbeated nearly every day. 10 days ago I started reading a book I received for Christmas “Mantak Chia - Taoist secrets of love: Cultivating male sexual energy” (there is also a female version for the ledies out there) , probably my best lecture on the eastern colture of love. It explains the importance of semen retention for the man in general and mainly for his love life. But the main topic are all the specifically described methods to apply (alone or with your partner) to let your sexual energy (Ching, as it is named in the book) flow all trough your body, healing and fueling it. I put into practice just some of the techniques and believe me Guys , the effects are incredible, I have a lot more dick-mind connection, those disgusting fetishes finally disappeared (and if they come back I know how to handle ‘em) , I get erections way faster and way stronger. Don’t worry if you don’t wanna follow taoism because you already have your believes, it is nothing religious, it just treats man’s health from the taoist-buddhist point of view. I recommend you to read also ‘Mantak chia - The multi-orgasmic man’ from the same author and see his videos on YouTube. Wish you good luck, whatever your choise, just know that our sexual energy is one the most powerful weapon we have, and learning to use it will make a great difference both in bed and in everyday life.

Recently I had to go and have a blood test, somehow my doctor was able to tell I was masturbating, and he gradually educated me about the horrible effects of masturbating.
I concluded that I had problems, or as my doctor called them ""indicators"", in my body.
Later I learnt that masturbating can cause a heck of a lot of problems, such as lack of motivation and disability to mature properly.
I was really scared, but my doctor consoled me, and guided me to this ""Nofap"" thing.

First post in a long time, after a few long streaks, 90+, I got cocky and soon they became 60 days, then 30 days, and recently I got into a rut of 3 day streaks.

I noticed that ever since I started hitting the gym multiple times a week, lifting and taking ZMA/Zinc, after each workout I notice that my relapse has less of an effect on my mood and confidence than it did when I wasn’t exercising.

So the consequences of relapsing felt less, and so it was easier to give in. I got to a point when it was really getting to me, and so I’m now back on the horse and on day 6.

Does anybody else notice feeling somewhat confident with exercise, even after relapses? And then on top of the world with nofap + exercise.

10637,Telling my Story,Unable to resist the urge while working from home and remember auditory cues.,"I'm 30+yrs old.I did Ayahuasca trying to give up the addiction. When one goes to do this ritual, he needs to set an intention to resolve an issue.Noticed the intention behind giving up this addiction was being closer to the Divinity.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that eating vegan dumbed down my sex drive and was able to resist 3 days (instead of the required 14 days) of no sexual activity before Ayahuasca (while normally I would do it 2 times/day). The ritual was intense; afterwards I managed to not fap only with the help of prayer. But maybe that acted as a distraction in itself and helped me focus on something else. I was VIGILENT and every time a sexual thought came into my head, I would say a mind prayer.

I'm a digital hoarder  and I index and collect porn. One thought while doing the Ayahuasca meditation was that I should delete everything and never look back. I wasn't that strong plus I couldn't throw away all that hard work accumulated in 10-15 years of watching the stuff online &amp; downloading and indexing videos. I also have a notebook in Evernote with adult actresses placed alphabetically. I think I reached a point where it became my *hobby* \-100%. (not *obsession* necessarily)

With the Ayahuasca boost and thinking more about God and how I should not be doing it, and practicing some prayer.... I managed to abstain about 45 days.

Then Instagram happened. (I was using mostly facebook, normally, but that day, I opened Insta) Saw a very hot looking russian woman and just scrolled and scrolled through her photos , thinking I would be able to resist the urge. It didn't happen like that.

I wrote down a tip: if you start thinking/watching an image or a sex related content, the easiest time  to quit is as soon as you've started thinking about it, analyzing it. The more you look, the more enticing it is and the more weaker you're going to be in front of its influence.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I'm doing it 1-2x / day. It's interrupting my work, sometimes &amp; the other thing that I hate is that I have very high standards or needs on how a woman is supposed to look in order for me to be attracted to her (because of being used to very good looking women on the digital medium &amp; also because of my 1st girlfriend I was with around 20-21 yrs; it was like in a game where they give you all your powers and show you how it is at the end, and then they strip them from you to get you back to level 1).

&amp;#x200B;

**1st problem:**

Ok, say I start practicing the technique again, but **there are some days when the urge is so strong that my mind is working against me in the sense that I have to fight it for 2-3 or 4 hours straight and I can't focus on work because of not being sexually satisfied** (I don't have a partner; i'm 32 yrs old; I look quite ok &amp; workout, but couldn't find a girl that I'm into , that's also into me, due to the high as f&amp;ck standards that my brain has)

&amp;#x200B;

And I give in to the desire of watching the stuff, just to be able to get on with my work; otherwise , I would not complete the tasks that I'm given in 8 hours due to the lack of focus that abstinence brings with it. (and would lose my job in the process)

Worth to mention I'm now eating normally; only vegan was time consuming, since I had to prepare mostly everything and what I ate in the city was not that nourishing as meat is. Plus I spent a lot more on vegan food than I do on meat/eggs/cheese and what-not.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\***2nd problem**:\*\*I have a very good musical ear / used to produce a bit of music; I can whistle works from Vivaldi and I have **a VERY VERY good auditory memory.**

This acts like a double edged sword: when the images that spawn in my head, regarding adult films that I've watched, and they aren't enough to make me give in, I can also remember the exact moans (&amp; timbre of their voices) that some actresses make and it's like almost playing a record inside my brain and it turns me on as fast as I would press play on the damn video.Think about remembering the exact scene with the exact sounds. How hard would it be to resist....? (and I can't go to the office all the time since I need the 8hrs sleep and commuting takes time away from that).

&amp;#x200B;

**3rd problem**: \*\*digital hoarding.  I can't get myself to throw this away.\*\*I invested a lot of time in collecting all of it and it resulted in about 1Tb of my HDD space dedicated to this stuff + an Evernote notebook  with screenshots of each actress in her most hottest scene.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I could go clean if I could just press delete on the whole collection. But this is where I don't even want to do it. (and I feel no shame after masturbating either). Ayahuasca failed me because of my 3rd problem.

Any thoughts?

10650,Confession,I’m an addict. *POSSIBLE TRIGGERS WARNING*,"It’s not easy to come to terms with the phrase. It’s not easy to accept that you rely on a dose of feel good hormones to get you through the day. It is however very easy to turn your back on these cold, hard facts, and simply carry on with your same, old, relapsing life. That is the definition of my life. 

I’ve been masturbating since I was 10 and now I’m 17. It started off at my friend’s birthday party, he was watching some soft core lesbian shit. 10 year old me was very interested, and so I started watching it at home. I quickly found out it made me feel good down there so obviously I kept on returning. I can’t remember exactly how old I was when I found P, but I do remember just how much she gave to me, and how little she asked of me. We became best friends, I would always go to her, even though she never called me. I would always please myself to her, even though she never asked me. But she made me feel good, as as a young teenager, what more than a euphoric orgasm could I ask for?

Well, at 14, I met a girl. A REAL girl. We spoke then we got together and we loved each other. We still do. However one day, I confessed I watch porn, but was too afraid to admit I do it because it makes me feel good. So she now thought I watched it because I thought they were better than her. One day, my girlfriend threatened she would leave me if I kept watching porn. It broke me.

Obviously I couldn’t just stop, but I wasn’t sure why. I just kept going back to it. So now, I was watching it behind her back, treading on thin ice. I couldn’t lose her. The realisation that the longer I carried on in this cycle of doom, the more depressed I would feel, resulted in me finding NoFap. I’d searched for weeks about masturbation problems, but I’d never searched the word addiction. It never even crossed my mind. WikiHow’s bullshit, biased therapist articles, you name it I read it. I would make promises that I would never do it again, but within a matter of hours I’d relapsed without a care in the world.

It was only when I found NoFap that I really began to understand the seriousness of the situation. I had a very serious problem on my hands. 

In June last year, in the departures section of the airport while I was waiting to go on a trip to Portugal with my college, I kick started this journey for real. I decided that for the 2 weeks I was there I would not masturbate once. I didn’t and I had the best 2 weeks of my life. 3 days later, I went to London on a trip with college, and went the whole week without relapsing. I made new friends, found self-confidence, self-love, self-appreciation and most importantly I could be myself. I was on top of the world. That summer shaped my life, adding to the fact England had a decent World Cup, it really did shape my life. 

Since, I have downloaded porn blockers, maintained streaks I never thought I could, spoken to people I never thought I would, rekindled friendships, shut out negatives in my life and finally began to cement my goals and aspirations in life.

But it’s not all been plain sailing. With every fairy tale comes a dark twist. A week ago the only thought that filled my head was to end my life. It was relapse after relapse after relapse. I hated my job, I felt like I was worthless and worst of all I still hadn’t confided in my girlfriend that I’m still addicted. It was this point I had finally admitted to myself that I was addicted. The next relapse wasn’t just for pleasure, it was to get rid of the pain. I knew now, that I was simply addicted. It hurt to admit it, but it hurts even more to keep it in, as I have witnessed over the last couple of years.

There are a few different morals to my story (I never intended to be this long) but I will simplify it down to two very important ones. 1) This is an addiction, it will eat away at you, don’t ever tell yourself it will be easy. And 2) You aren’t horny. Your brain is craving dopamine. YOU ARE NOT HORNY, YOU DO NOT WANT SEX. YOUR BRAIN WANTS DOPAMINE. These are the two most important things I could tell you.

Lastly, and if you’re still reading, which I highly doubt, then thank you so much for reading my story. No one is obliged to have read so far, as I mainly wanted to vent my own thoughts somewhere, but if you are still reading, don’t ever tell yourself you can’t do it. You can’t get to can’t without typing can first. Set your mind to your goals and ANYTHING is possible. I still have a long, long way to go, but trust me when I say this for us all, it’ll all be worth it in the end. Thank you so much for your time, keep it strong, keep it real and good luck brothers.

10655,Journal Check-In,2 weeks!,"2 weeks in.. this is the longest I’ve ever gone without PMO. Honestly I haven’t really seen the “super powers” that everyone talks about. I am definitely more motivated to do things now. I’ve been making my bed everyday, have lots of motivation to workout. 

I did get rejected by a friend that I’ve liked for a long time and I wanted to relapse so bad but I didn’t. I read someone on here saying you can do anything you set your mind to and I actually am starting to finally believe it. 

I am honestly pretty terrified to fail. It kind of looms over me everyday, but this time I’m stopping because I really want to. I don’t want to waste these precious years of my life wondering when I will be able to look at porn again.

10698,Motivation,Little story about playing volleyball against withdrawing drug addicts and the best nofap benefit for me,"Just had a volleyball game in a withdrawel clinic/soft jail due to them beeing in our hobby league. After the match, I chatted them up, when we sat down together and had a genuinely interesting talk with them about there every day life, past and what not. These guys fucked up in the worst ways possible but atleast tried for the moment to improve. I had nothing but respect for that and they appreciated that some guy from outside was easy to talk with and wasn´t intimidated. Meanwhile my team is sitting in the same room but couldn´t have looked more uncomfortable with beeing around these guys.

Afterwards, in the car back home, one guy basicly went with. Nice one making it awkward for everyone in the room, due to asking the drug dealing/armed robber, personal questions like, what gave him the change of mind. Like that dude or any other of these guys even gave two shits. All I saw, was someone trying to excuse his awkwardness by blaming me to apparently not beeing able to read the room.

Beeing fully honest, reading that room felt amazing to me and I sure as hell would have been just as intimidated as my teammates a few months back. Moments like girls giving you the looks or just having much more energy is the shit, but little situations like these are the best.

Long story short. People are always gonna find a way to hate, you just gotta get back to not giving so many fucks.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aedswq/little_story_about_playing_volleyball_against/

10717,Advice to NoFap,Interesting way to keep relapse at bay,"Come to this subreddit, reply on someone's post, give them encouragement, write your own tips &amp; stories once in awhile &amp; basically, just contribute to this community rather than relying on it. 

why this works 
- alcohol addiction rehab groups use a similar technique where they come together once in awhile to share their struggles &amp; encourage one another 
- this way they build a community who help one another stay on the task

- we are the same, by contributing, our sense of belonging to the group grows, we are no longer just readers of this subreddit, we are contributors &amp; when that happens, your sense of belonging to the group increases, with that you want to stay and fight with fellow fapstronauts more.

- when you feel like relapsing, you rely on the group, you think of the group of how you encouraged one of the guys to not relapse then you feel guilty for feeling like relapsing then you stop because you feel accountable.

- accountability &amp; sense of belonging to this community is a another strong layer of protection you can build for yourself from relapse. By doing so, you add one more line of defense besides your own willpower &amp; self-discipline, which we all know aren't always 100% reliable.
- by adding this layer of community, you increases your chances of overcoming a relapse more.

These days I'm inspired by just how much encouragement goes around in this group, I've tried nofap on my own before but always failed miserably but when I found this community, I was able to overcome my urges better. 

It was always - oh man I just encouraged that guy &amp; told him not to relapse with an interesting tip - why am I feeling like I want to give up to a relapse now? That always stopped me from relapsing.

So don't just be watchers, bystanders &amp; observers, be commenters &amp; encourage people. Don't just be commenters &amp; upvoters, type a post once in awhile of how you overcome that urge and share with us how you did it.

Be an active contributor &amp; you will be rewarded with satisfaction that far surpasses a relapse.

10762,New to NoFap,Is it acceptable to limit your fapping rather than quit completely?,"Hi, so I’m new to the sub but not to the *idea* of nofap itself. I’m 22 years old and I’ve been masturbating since I was 12. I’ve never had sex. I used to fap at *least* 1 or 2 times a day.

Over the years I had occasionally tried to limit my fapping. I once tried fapping just once every two weeks. I had mild success at first but eventually just couldn’t keep it up. I ended up breaking schedule and eventually just fell back into my daily fap routine. At the time, I never noticed any positive change in my life while off the fap.

During the summer, however I decided to give it another proper go. This time I set myself a realistic goal. I’d fap once, take a 3 day break and then repeat again. I was even able to keep this up during college. I eventually relapsed during the mid-term out of boredom. Once the mid-term finished I easily got back into my 3-day routine.

I have to say though I definitely noticed a positive change while going nofap. My social confidence was honestly the best it had ever been. I felt completely at peace while out public. I’m not exactly the most sociable person but I was so much less self-conscious and it honestly made me much happier.

I also didn’t feel guilty when I masturbated every three days either. I actually really enjoyed it. It felt like a reward that I’d earned.

However I’d still like to go on and do better. I’ve recently discovered this sub and it’s pretty inspiring to see all the positive stories. It’s great to see so many people getting their lives on track.

I was surprised however to see that the objective here is to stop fapping completely? Whenever I had gone cold turkey in the past, I was always daunted by the fact that I’d never fap again. It just made it seem so much harder not having anything to work towards, which is why the whole idea of a schedule works so much better for me.

I want to extend my schedule from once every 3 to days, to hopefully once every 7 days, and eventually once every 14 days. My question is this, **what are the benefits of quitting fapping completely, versus the benefits of just doing it once every fortnight?** And is that a thing that people actually do on this sub?

Thank you for reading. Sorry for such a long winded post, just wanted to share how I was doing.

TL;DR: I would like to limit my fapping to once a fortnite rather than quit completely, as I still enjoy controlled masturbation as a reward. Is that a common thing here and is there much difference results wise between the two?

It’s probably worth mentioning that if I were to ever get a girlfriend, I would likely cut my fapping out completely.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aeehkx/is_it_acceptable_to_limit_your_fapping_rather/
10801,Motivate Me,"THE PLAN: quit fapping, quit smoking weed, quit drinking. THE PROBLEM: Injured so cannot work out resulting in restlessness beyond reason (TLDRs at bottom)","I recently relapsed at day 25 because the energy surge i receive makes me extremely restless to the point where i only think about working out or chasing ass.

 At the moment i have over worked my knees and shoulders to the point where i continually have issues with swelling in my joints resulting from minimal exertion. I worked my body twice a day at the gym for almost 3 months straight losing 26lbs in the process until i was physically no longer capable without making my injuries worse. First hurting one knee, then the other, then both shoulders. I am currently trying to keep my range of motion the best i can without being able to go back to therapy. Until i get insurance back there is no way i can go back so I am left with an uncontrollable need to pursue ass and no way to physically exert myself as a distraction. It's been 8 months too, i keep reinjuring myself everytime i start working out again because i need the exertion so bad. Its so infuriating especially combined with nofap i become extremely restless and irritable. I'm used to throwing every single ounce of my energy into weights when i am frustrated. It payed off short term but has backfired and left me with alot of injuries

 Making matters worse i still need to stop smoking weed before school starts back up again on the 23rd so i will be a sweaty anxious mess for the next two weeks no doubt. I also need to get my drinking under control because i drink alot more after quitting weed to cope with cold sweats (yes, from quitting weed not booze. odd i know). I had stopped smoking for 2 weeks until i had reinjured myself. I stayed non smoking for a week trying to suck it up until i caved because i was turning into a miserable bastard with every effort to continue on seemingly making my injuries worse. I needed to simply relax for my body to repair itself. shortly after starting smoking again complacency set in and i relapsed on fapping as well. After 4 days of hitting rock bottom I got angry at my incompetence and am back at it with new found resolve. Would have posted in r/leaves about this part but it ties into my ability to fight urges.

Fellow fapstronauts, how can i get my chakras balanced out. What tool am i missing here? To me it seems like the only way to move forward is meditation. If I can get my racing, obsessive thoughts under control I have a chance. Otherwise i end up with a whole lot of energy and no way to expend it. It sucks because i hate meditating as its boring as hell but if i can't master being idle i think i will just keep hurting myself more or relapsing because its ass on my mind all day. I have alot to accomplish in 13 days, nofap gods give me strength.

Will post updates on how this all plays out, just need to take it day by day. I think i will need some help getting through this one boys.

(TLDR; How do i control the 1 month in energy surge without being able to workout? Thats my biggest problem. Working out is how i used to keep my urges under control. meditation is the only idea i have so far but am resistant because its boring. I am also quitting smoking weed and later drinking as they seem to make relapse more likely. quitting weed causes cold sweats making my armpits constantly wet making anxiety even worse. Do they make WMD strength anti-perspirant for this problem? If i could solve this one problem i could quit trees with almost no effort. anxious cold sweats make it impossible to feel comfortable, especially during winter.)

(Actual TLDR; How do i handle the 1 month energy surge when i need to limit activity due to physical injury? PS: anybody else have trouble with cold sweats quitting weed?)",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aeetb7/the_plan_quit_fapping_quit_smoking_weed_quit/
10824,Telling my Story,Doing it for a girl,"I met a girl recently and I think the attraction is mutual, but I don’t wanna mess this up. She’s really special and honestly one of the most beautiful girls I know. I’ve decided to do NoFap indefinitely, since everybody talks about how it increases your testosterone and confidence levels and stuff. 

The furthest I’ve ever made it is 21 days, last November. I was really proud of that and was really ashamed when I failed. Even in those 3 short weeks though, I was super confident with girls and just with myself.

I’m not gonna fuck my chances up with this girl over some stupid addiction that doesn’t even make me feel good once the deed is done. I have a lot of free time so sometimes I get into habits of doing it 2-4 times a day and that’s just awful feeling.

Usually I can’t do NoFap because I don’t have enough cause. This is a reason that’s worth fighting for. Every urge, every impulse, I’m gonna ignore. I won’t quit this time.

Too many times I made it to 7 days and let it slip through rationalozation and lack of discipline. While I have made MASSIVE gains so far simply from reducing my average faps, I am yet to level up from this mortal world.

No. Dont be that slave; that cuck to the desires of a beast. Animals have no control over their impulses as the brain structure simply doesnt exist; don't fap away your potential in life and look back when you're too old to move, or care, and wonder. Regret. That's scary. Fuck that. Look back in 5 years from now on the best decision you've ever made in your life. Look at what you've created; accomplished; whatever your personal dreams are. Don't let your dreams be dreams. Anotha one. Peace out.

My ENTIRE LIFE I was scared shitless of people, let alone girls and having a first date. Knocked one out of the park the other day, confident in myself and the attraction on her end was clear. From a socially anxious tragedy to a 26-year old trying to become a man. Too bad I'm fucked up and won't be seeing her again, but I've come a looooong way in this world. Talking to hot girls is not only becoming easier, but not even that big of a deal. I have huge personal goals that dwarf the anxieties I've been obsessed with my whole life.

11114,Motivate Me,32 years wasted,"I'm 32 years old, have been masturbating since I was 14!!!! That's over 18 years of fapping. And I do it multiple times a week, and in few occasions multiple times a day! 

Just to put things into prospective, find below estimated calculations from my personal experience:

Average number of fapping per week=4
Average time looking for the right porn =30 min
Average time doing the actual act =5 -15 (7.5) min
Average time taking showers after =15 min

4*(30+7.5+15)=150 minutes per week. 
Per year (150*52)=7800 minutes 
Overall wasted time 7800*18=140400 minutes 
That's equivalent to 2340 hours!!!!!! 

Trust me guys, I'm being very conservative in my figures, I really believe it's even worse than presented! I didn't even include the times I stay in bed feeling like shit after fapping. Or looking for new clothes, or falling asleep :(

I can feel the impact of porn and fapping on my personal life and interpersonal relationships. Zero added value while doing it, and tremendous amount of negativity. One of which, is lack of confidence, feeling always lethargic, no desire to leave the house, and foggy thoughts. 
I detest it when people try to justify pron and fapping.. Look, you are free to do whatever your heart desires but don't convince yourself and others that this is the way life is meant to be lived. It's so detrimental. 

 
I had many and I mean many attempts to quit by myself but I constantly failed. I've heard about this community and I wanted to try it publicly in order to commit myself in front of you and have your support. I'm on my 3rd day now. And I'll keep updating this trend daily. Wish me luck guys. I'll be transparent about the whole journey.

Ps: Don't get me wrong guys, I'm not a total loser, I got my own apartment, decent job, a car, and I'm loan free! However, it takes me 10 times the amount of effort normal people need to achieve these.

11125,Relapse Report,A real news years resolution.,"(This is just me mumbling after a relapse)

10 days in and now I know what blue balls feels like... 

For a while now I've actually been able to go for about 1-2 weeks at a time which I guess can be considered ""NORMAL"" masturbation and not addiction, though its not NoFap material.

I've been addicted since practically 11 and combine that with being born naturally with depression, and so as you can guess, it's not that fun. I'm now in my 3rd year of community college (psych major) and here im in a weird transition. The past two years I have felt like I'm in the middle of the old me and the new me. Not that im complaining, its just this weird awkward time. Simply because nothing is happening in my life.

I'm trying to be a more patient person, trying to be more motivated, and also trying to find new hobbies.

I've never been in a shape I considered good enough to get a relationship. It's not like I have low self esteem, but rather I just simply get confused thinking about loving another person. I've had girls I was interested in before, but it was nothing more than me admiring them, both personality and looks. Friends tell me that a certain actress is ""hot as fuck"" and to avoid any questions I lie my way through by agreeing. Meanwhile said actress does nothing for me. 

From what I think I understand about myself I really care about personality, and I probably just have not found someone I'd like yet.

Porn definetly doesn't help considering I've developed weird fetishes that I don't think will ever go away. Porn never was about the bodies to me either, instead it was all about the act. The act that acted like a drug silently killing me from the inside out. Porn literally passed the time whenever I was depressed or just bored out of my mind. It would just be nice to be ""NORMAL"". Though again, I'm not complaining.

I've made significant progress to be honest. Overcomming natural depression and finding a career goal in life (high school psychologist), taking better care of my mental health and financials. 

I want to do something with my life, and I want to find a cute gf to be with.

So can I just say that 2019 is MY FUCKING YEAR (and yours too).

I'm gonna start it by DEMOLISHING my two month best and losing some god damn weight.

11168,Success Story,Day 14: My Life is Already Changing,"I'm only two weeks in on my NoFap streak, but holy shit, I already feel like a different person.

Notable things that I noticed occurring:

1. **I cleaned almost the entire apartment**. Sounds basic? It's actually always been such a major problem for me that I could've easily ended up on an episode of Oprah. Forget girls, I couldn't invite a homeless guy into my apartment, because he would've freaked out about how fucking disgusting it was. But I fucking cleaned it! I still need to wash the stove and all the dishes, but at least now I am comfortable letting non-romantic interests inside my apartment :)
3. **People tell me I look a lot better**. They say I look like I lost weight: I'm not as red anymore and something with my cheeks looking different. I do actually measure myself daily and I only lost 1 or 2 pounds—not enough to cause such a drastic change, so I'm attributing these improvements to NoFap.
4. **I feel super confident**. From [my earlier posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ablca0/22_years_of_fapping_leaving_behind_a_destroyed/), some may know I was kind of a socially awkward, shy hermit. The shyness is fucking gone now. In just these two weeks, I signed up for sewing classes and during my first class I walked around and helped out other students who had trouble with their stuff. I also signed up for this project group at work: I'm the only guy there, with about 12 other people in the group, many of which are really hot women. During our last meet up, I felt completely comfortable and was one of the people who most actively participated in the discussions.

So that's my report :) The NoFap thing is totally working! I'm only two weeks in, but I already feel like my life is changing and I have a ton of extra time on my hands that I can spend on more productive things than fapping.",49,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aeicgl/day_14_my_life_is_already_changing/

11207,Emergency - Help!,PIED - Day 10 - Met a girl.. help?,"So my New Years resolution was to be completely tap free not just 2019 but for life. 

I’m on day 10 currently.. and I haven’t really noticed anything apart from waking up with a 20% reception (morning wood) this morning.

Now I met this girl at the New Years party I had &amp; we’ve kicked it off.. she had a boyfriend when I first met her but has since broken up with him as she feels a lot happier with me. 

When I’ve been with her we’ve been cuddling, holding hands etc and I feel little erections down there when this happens like 30%. Better than nothing I know, but when I’m by myself I don’t get any erections at all since I started NoFap this year.

I’ve probably been addicted to porn since I was 16 and now I’m 22, I’ve slept with about 40 girls but noticed my last two experiences in 2018 my erections we’re getting weaker.. this was while I was still watching porn. 

I think I have PIED hence why I wanted to start NoFap.

The girl I’m currently seeing I’ve said to her I don’t want to rush into anything as I want to see out the 30day hard mode.

Why am I having little to no movement down there right now?

Is cuddling &amp; kissing a girl a good thing? 
As I’m rewiring my brain to an actually human and not pixels?

And after the 30 days if we have sex, will my PIED come back cause I don’t want it to feel dead after?

P.S longest streak is 21 days and I noticed k was almost fully recovering before slipping down into my habit again. Currently no libido &amp; balls feel permanently empty.

It started off as curiosity in magazines and has slowly led to deeper and deeper things like hardcore porn, masturbating in public bathrooms, webcam sex, and eventually doing sexual things with a girl for the first time in real life 3 years back. It’s been a road of shame and guilt and lies and mind fog. I’ve seen the detriments porn and masturbation has had on my emotional and mental health (depression, suicidal thoughts and self harm last year were taking over my life). But i’m here today, 9 days clean and loving the benefits. My relationship with God has been a lot closer, and i feel as if i’m experiencing my life again. The cheap thrills porn and masturbation give are *NO* comparison to the excitement and energy of real life...because a life without porn is a life that’s lived in reality. We crave intimacy and closeness and i’ve thankfully found that in God, good friends, and my family...all of which i hope you get to experience someday as well. I used to lay in bed for days because i was so depressed...to the point that my hamstrings got sore because they weren’t getting used. but today? i got up at 5:30am to pray and read, worked out for an hour and now i’m eating a healthy breakfast. It may not mean much but i’m here to tell you all that tangible change is real and *so* *so* worth it. Everyday we have a choice: we either give in to the plastic satisfaction of our own sexual desires, or run into a different, soul-satisfying way of living. Today, which one will you choose?

11287,Advice to NoFap,Day 10 - The Urge Waves is real! Beware!,"Before i start, i just wanted to tell you that i don't abstain from PMO all together, i just abstain from P. I'm sorry, please don't judge me. I am trying to abstain from P so that i can at least make the 1.01% daily improvement, so by the end of the year i would've made 37.5% (or something like that) improvement.


So, **The Urge Waves**. I just read a post somewhere that the urge waves usually starting to appear at **Day 7 to Day 21**. So the urges i am feeling right now, is definitely a red light for me, and for you too who is between your day 7 to day 21.


Let me address what the urge waves is doing (to me, at least):

1. Make me fantasize all the P i was trying to abstain from.

2. Finding justification to relapse, and since i love to debate, i always debate with my ""other self"" that the justification isn't valid at all, or any justification to relapse really.

3. All of the things that is trying to pull me back to relapse mode significantly gets stronger. Like boredom, which i can handle at my day 1 until day 8 suddenly feels so heavy to resist. 

4. My mind is filled with temptation to relapse, but everytime it does, i open r/NoFap to seek motivation.


To motivate all of you who is currently trying to fight back these urge waves, here's a motivation:

1. After abstaining from P for 10 days, i no longer objectify women. No longer i see them merely as a sexual partner, instead i see them as equal to me (Which is how normal human  sees all women)

2. I no longer feel awkward talking to my friends, wether it's a guy or a girl. And i am not talking about the 'telling embarrassing moments' awkward, i am talking about the awkwardness to talk normally to them. I even can set a limit on how far i should flirt with a girl, and not crossing the line.

3. My sleep pattern is starting to be normal again, although i am a night owl myself, but i can wake up to the time i wanted.

4. The brain fog is starting to vanish, now i can modify chords on my guitar to make it sounds better, or how now i can imagine the full plot of a story i want to make. Basically, it made me feel like i was regaining the intelligence of my brain that was being hidden away by the brain fog.

5. My reflex when i feel the urge now is not to submit to the urge, instead my reflex now is to open r/NoFap to seek motivation and to motivate others who are fighting their own battles right now.

11325,Emergency - Help!,How do you guys deal with urges when you're trying to fall asleep?," 

This is by far when urges hit me the hardest. I've completed all my work for the day, I'm tired, I crawl into bed. And then it hits me, the damn urges. It's gotten to the point where I have EXTREME difficulty falling asleep if I don't MO. During the day it's no issue because I can find other things to occupy my time instead, but when I'm laying in bed at night with nothing to do besides lay there, it's at least 10 times harder.

Things I've tried:

\-Weed (makes it worse)  
\-Melatonin (works sometimes but I always require more sleep when I take it, like 10 hours opposed to 8)

\-Just jerking off to get it over with (sad to say, but it works. I fall asleep instantly. But I don't want to have to resort to this.)

Any tips or advice you guys have would be much appreciated.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aekz07/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_urges_when_youre_trying/
11330,Announcement,Coming soon: Meme-Free Fridays at NoFap,"Hello all,

Starting this Friday we will make the subreddit text-only for the duration of the day to encourage more quality content. If it goes well, we will do this every week.  We are doing this as a compromise: many people on the subreddit do not like the memes and believe that is encourages karma-farming and buries more quality text posts. 


We agree to an extent, but also weigh that agreement with knowledge that most people on the subreddit do enjoy the memes, and that memes can be high quality and motivational. We have taken surveys in the past and over 50% wanted them to stay, since they do provide a bit of a ""break"" from the seriousness of the negative effects that porn addiction and compulsive sexual behavior can have on our lives. 


So we figure that creating a meme-free day once a week would be a good compromise for now: those who are tired of the memes will enjoy a whole day free of them, and those who post memes in order to contribute and feel connected with the rest of the community will still be able to do so the rest of the week. As always, we encourage high-quality content over low-quality content. If you have nothing more to contribute than ""Day 2"" or posting a meme with little relevance to rebooting or retention, we would prefer if you paused and took a few minutes to write down something meaningful which the community can actually learn from. This could be your story, what has been going well for you, what has been going poorly for you, etc.

In addition to Meme-Free Fridays, mods have been removing redundant and super-low quality memes. Seriously, if a meme was posted earlier in the same day, stop reposting it 10 times and first search to see if the image is already on the frontpage of the forum.


Also, *some of the responsibility is on you, as a community member.* As followers of this forum, *please put more effort into downvoting bad content and upvoting good content.* That's how Reddit works. Instead of simply complaining about the quality of content, which is relatively useless, actually contribute quality content yourself and engage in voting good content up (and low effort content down) in the ""[new](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/new/)"" section. If you're here to recover from porn addiction, actually taking time to read quality posts might aid in your recovery, learning to embrace delayed satisfaction over instant satisfaction.

11331,Motivate Me,Depression hitting hard.,"Warning: discussion about self harm.

I’ve been in a pretty horrific depressive episode the last few days. It all boiled up and resulted in another self-harm incident, which I haven’t had in over a month. On top of that, said incident was also the worst I’ve ever had (won’t be wearing short-sleeved shirts for a while). Suicidal thoughts returned as well and they’ve been dancing around my head all day.

Before I continue; yes I’m getting help. I have a somewhat effective support network and I see a counsellor.

Anyway, despite all of this, the urge to fap has been nil. It’s not out of motivation or conscious effort, but discipline. I’ve learned to exercise discipline in a huge amount of areas in my life.
I have my first MMA fight in 2 months, so I train 6 days a week for that. I follow my nutrition requirements like gospel, and I don’t masturbate.

As a result of doing the first two things, exercising discipline over the third is becoming second nature. 
My point is, during times like these, motivation ain’t shit. Discipline is the only thing you’ll be able to count on.

11389,New to NoFap,First time sincerely trying to quit,"This is my first time trying to quit porn and I've made this account for accountability purposes.

I suppose my triggers are from two things: being alone/bored and seeing an attractive person's image, and being sexually aroused without my partner also being aroused. Causal browsing, especially on Reddit or YouTube, usually leads to temptations that I give into too easily. I think being part of this community will help with accountability and cultivating discipline. Since I feel so much shame and embarrassment about this I think an online community is perfect since it's anonymous and as long as I remain disciplined I think I'll be able to get the same reward as if I was going to say an in-person meeting.

I want to quit so I can feel unchained from this pleasure-shame cycle that I've been part of since my early- to mid-teens. I am also hoping it will lead to better sex with my partner, who I have kept my porn-viewing habit from. I am very tired of living a double life in this area. I know it's a waste of time too, when I could be doing more productive things, but yet I still waste time each session with zero benefit to show for it.

Here‘s my motivation:
In case you‘ve been active on here for a couple of months, you should already know about a lot of scientific evidence that porn and PMO in general isn‘t good for your brain and body in general. So there‘s no way you could go back to your old habits and just give up.

11424,Confession,What is my problem?,"Hi, I'm 17 years old, and I'm addicted to pornography since 2015. I discovered the movement NoFap last October, I discovered NoFap because I thought I was getting addicted to pornography because at one point I spent at least an hour of my day watching pornography and I started researching about pornography addiction and I ended up discovering this incredible community.

This is my first post here, because I do not really like to expose myself but it's time to end this addiction and I need your help to do it. I do not know why I see pornography, I'm a person who has a good relationship with a wonderful girl, but I think I just see her just for sex; I have a lot of friends and I hangout with them; I have intermediate grades at school, not bad at all. So I do not know what the problem is for using pornography all days. I use pornography many times when I'm bored, but even when I'm doing something like studying, the urge comes and I relapse.

With this post I wanted all the help possible, also as tips to stop this addiction. You can ask me questions in the comments that I will answer to all of you.

11426,Journal Check-In,A water softener changed my life,"Our house has extremely hard water since our family moved in 7 years ago (I was 12 years old), and I would always get made fun of for having dandruff and dry skin in school. Despite me being a good-looking guy, no matter how much I cleaned up I just couldn't have good hygeine.

I believe this is how I really got into porn. I didn't even have distant hope of finding a girlfriend in that condition. I was a 8/10 that looked like a 3/10 because I felt so nasty. Look up the effects of hard water on the body. 

Last week I finally spent $700 on a water softener and it really has changed my life for the better in terms of confidence. I've had a job for about a year but haven't had enough funds until now due to bills. 

I can now walk with confidence, get closer to people (physically too, I was always self-conscious of how I smelled to others) and I pretty much am loving my life so much more due to installing a simple appliance in the house. My work productivity has exploded and people have told me that they've noticed an attitude change for the better. 

Due to this setback though, I do believe I have one of the best hygeinic routines out of everyone I know and have perfect skin, a good-smelling body and amazing hair. 


TLDR - Hard water fucked my skin and hair up and made me look/feel worse than my best. Went to the root of the issue and bought a water softener. 

MORAL - Maybe you shouldn't focus on quitting porn so much as the *afflictions* that make your life so stressful to make you want to watch porn. Stop playing video games/scrolling through social media so much. Eat less junk food. Do what improves yourself, even while jerking off. Just because you can't stop watching porn doesn't mean you can't do everything else in your ability to improve your life.

\- Have consumed pornography since age 13 ( before I could ejaculate)

\- Currently masturbate 2/3 times in one session every 2 to 3 days.

\- Hair thinning on top (sides are fine)

It has definitely been one of the most difficult years of my life.  I would use fapping as a crutch to dull the pain of all the things going on around me.  I can definitely say after a year of NoFap, I am now on a more favorable path.

I didn’t like myself very much at all before NoFap.  But, now I am a stronger version of myself then what I was exactly a year ago, physically, and mentally.

One of the most important things that I practiced last year was self love.  It all started with NoFap where I would rely on outside sources to make me happy or to even feel anything!  It has been a full year and I love myself a little more everyday! I feel like I am enough rather than trying to fill a void that I couldn’t with fapping or with trying to find any ounce of acceptance from anything or anyone.  When in reality, the only acceptance I needed was from within all along.  From within, I was able to pursue all the things that I truly wanted in my life.  This past year I conquered every single one of my goals that I set out to do, and then some!

I’ve probably been addicted to porn since I was 16 and now I’m 22, I’ve slept with about 40 girls but noticed my last two experiences in 2018 my erections we’re getting weaker.. this was while I was still watching porn. 

I think I have PIED hence why I wanted to start NoFap.

Why am I having little to no movement down there right now?

Is cuddling &amp; kissing a girl a good thing? 
As I’m rewiring my brain to an actually human and not pixels?

11705,Advice to NoFap,This Can Change NoFap For Life(Part 1),"Disclaimer: (this is part 1 of 4 part post)
 
Hi All, I want to share something with everyone that I been contemplating about for a while now, what I would call the ""Missing Link"" in NoFap. I want to share it because I think it could help people starting NoFap and even ppl who are well into their journey be successful at a much higher rate. This is just my theory but I've put a lot of thought into this so plz hear me out.

First a brief history of my own story, I first discovered porn when I was just 11 years old and have been using ever since(I'm 28 now) for the most part fapping almost every day averaging 2 times a day. I've discovered NoFap a couple years ago but never had any long term success with it, it always felt like walking up a muddy wet hill metaphorically. I would have short streaks once in a while (less than a week) but would always relapse over and over again, and I couldn't figure out why. 

You ever feel like NoFap is this constant struggle between what's good FOR YOU and what FEELS good almost like an angel and Satan fighting in your brain telling you to NoFap, while another part is just saying but PMO feels so good! This is how I always feel when trying to resist porn. Like an angel and a devil fighting it out in your brain and unfortunately for most ppl fighting any kind of an addiction the devil wins most of the time.

But why is this? Why is it so hard to  NoFap if we know it's good for us and porn is inherently bad. Well lets look at a little bit of science. The more and more we watch porn our brains actually physically change.........yup.....you didn't read that wrong, our brains PHYSICALLY CHANGE(this blew my mind) this is because when we watch porn we get a rush of a brain chemical called dopamine which basically just makes us ""feel good"". But see when we watch porn we actually get over flooded with dopamine to the point our brain responds by literally taking away some of the dopamine receptors. This is why over time porn that use to excite you, no longer does and you have to watch a new type of porn or more specific porn to get the same rush you use to feel. Now why is it so hard to do NoFap successfully? Because once addiction sets in the brain the part of the brain called the ""frontal lobe"" is actually DAMAGED and SHRUNK.. again you didn't read that wrong the frontal lobe actually SHRINKS. Why is this a big deal? Well when you try to do something disciplined like NoFap it requires will power to not give in when you have that craving to relapse. And will power comes from the frontal lobe of the brain. And if it's shrunk and damaged there's a VERY LOW chance of someone having the will power to quit. Are you starting to see the problem here?

I stopped in october 2017, i'm sure of that. I met my beautiful girlfriend who hates porn as much as i do. I have not masturbated  since that time (and i won't) but recently (for a month of two) i have been LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES that i can see nudity in a sexual manner and then be mad at myself for doing this.  And i still am, as i just finished reading some, well, not specifically hentai, but nudity based manga and justify it by saying that i'm reading it because i'm CURIOUS. 

also I used to recall pornstar names and google them, just like that, without any nudity, clicking GRAPHICS on google and then oops, nudity.

I know, 100% that i won't masturbate and that i won't look at porn. there's no way. But why am i doing what i'm doing? why i'm ""curious"", why are the urges just to look coming back? and, i repeat, i'm 100% sure i won't masturbate and won't look at porn.

I believe that I'm a light case in general, cause spending aprox. 15 minutes, 2-5 times p/w isn't that great of a deal, but still I can feel the gap and while it's my first few days becoming PMO free, I'm realizing that I miss the ""research"" part more /weird.

11763,Advice to NoFap,"Just relapsed, but you don’t have to","I failed...
I failed all of you. I failed my family. I failed myself.
I just relapsed, and I’ve never been filled with so much regret. I turned my back on everything I value and care about in life. I could go on and on about how horrible I feel. But, the past is in the past, so better to learn from it and push forward
Looking back, I think I have some ideas from how resisted prior urges, and how I could have kept my streak

1. Fully commit

Unless you have completely shredded any compliance with PMO, you’re always going to go back to it for comfort. You have commit that you will not PMO and you have to commit fully. No exceptions. Only that level of commitment will carry you through when Hell breaks loose

2. Understand that this goes beyond yourself

If the only person you think about is yourself, it will be much more tempting to indulge in things that make you feel good. But, if you have a reason beyond yourself (i.e friends, family, SO, God) for breaking free from PMO, it will surprise you how much willpower you will gain. I was only thinking about myself and what I wanted when I relapsed, and I now realize that was a mistake.

3. Stay active

Nothing will bring stronger urges then laying on your bed, on your phone, with nothing to do. If you can just move and stay active, you will have both less urges and more willpower. I got back from a trip today, and when I got back from the airport I had nothing to do, so I went to my room and went on reddit. I was overwhelmed with my urges, but I still didn’t get out of my bed. If I had just done something else, I could have avoided relapse. Just put your shoulder to the wheel and do something, you’ll be surprised by how big of a difference it will make.

Relapsing is a painful experience, and it’s definitely not worth it. So stay strong my friends, fight the good fight, and remember why you started!",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aeq9jw/just_relapsed_but_you_dont_have_to/

12142,Advice to NoFap,Want nofap to be a bit easier?,"No PMO is difficult. I have been watching P ever since I was in my early teen years but last year I came accross nofap. I struggled to get a big streak and even though I predicted when the urges/cues would come, I just could not get control of this shitty habit and gave in usually when it got really difficult. My mind played me countless of times. 

Yet, I did not want to give up and started studying myself and my behavior a bit more deeply and found that I usually ‘did the deed’ when I was alone, bored and in my bed. 

I really could not change this cycle too much so I started to change my habits and environment instead. I made a small ‘master’ plan for myself and it actually worked to be honest. I went on vacation with friends and there was no alone time at all which helped me a lot to refrain from any kind of touching at all. This gave me a kickstart to my longest streak so far.

After this vacation I even moved to another country for half a year to study. This change of environment, change of bed (!) and a new found energy to step out of my comfort zone made it SO MUCH easier to kick PMO tf out of my life. I noticed that the new people I met appreciated me way more as they got to know the new me, out of the stupid control of P.  I’m really not exaggerating when I say those were among the best months of my life. Soms of the benefits:

- I enjoyed conversations and got to a way deeper level.
- I was happy with myself and planned forward without brain fog in the way
- I got way more attention from girls as I was so confident. 


Eventually I got to a huge streak of 60 but when I visited home for a week to catch up with family, it was 10x harder to not think of PMO and I relapsed .. 
My confidence levels were not hurt and when I got back it felt like I did not relapse at all, which led me on to a new streak, but it also made me rethink relapsing. I now think that a ‘rational’ and planned O (without ANY kind of P)  every 2-4 weeks is pretty good. This releases the pressure and keeps you from entering the flatline. 
The real fucker to beat then will be the chaser effect, as you automatically want more than 1 orgasm. If you manage to control this then your mind will associate O as something healthy without unrealistic stimulation. 

So bottom line guys, just from my experience:
- change your entire environment and boost your chances of success big time
- create your own ‘healthy’ O rhythm after a first big ~50 days+ ‘reboot’ streak. 

I sincerely hope this will help someone but I just know how fucking shitty the PMO cycle is if it’s super deeply ingrained in your daily habits. For me going out of that environment was the only solution that worked. ",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aeuutk/want_nofap_to_be_a_bit_easier/

- If its not an addiction why is it so hard to quit ?

- If we have the willpower to quit - we can all be successful, its all about succumbing to the temptations, we don't really need a ""fix"" 

- some say its like watching a series... We get hooked to it, but we train our minds to stop watching once its done

But say we had to give up watching TV/Netflix/YouTube altogether, would that also not be very difficult? Just as porn is ? Doesn't mean we are addicted to those things, but we've intergrated them into our daily lives... 

Just something interesting that came into my head :)

12210,Motivation,Journey so far,"I've been writing every day about the feelings and unpacking what I think when I wanted to look at porn and fap.

Next I also take my feelings to prayer. Some might meditate. This isn't distraction to fill a void but rather reconciling the feeling, or that void of the right feeling and mental and emotional state.

For me, emotionally stressful situations and times when I feel insignificant are prime conditions to jack off because this moments cover up and make me feel ""wanted"" or some shit.

Also, I mandated that I visit here and just get done thoughts out to people in community. So here it is. I'll be back in a week. Keep your hands high and pants on. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aewbue/journey_so_far/
12217,Telling my Story,"I don't deserve better, I DEMAND better. (my 2018 story)","So I started last year with the goal of ending my addiction to porn and self pleasure. I did not expect to make it as far as I did. Almost made it to 90 days. I was very proud. 

Here I will confess the rollercoaster of emotion I endured in 2018.

The first two months were difficult but I made it through. There were many cold showers and times where I needed to put my phone up to avoid relapse. But I was making progress and felt really good about myself for once.

I'd ended up contacting a very attractive woman at about that time. We spoke for about a week before the idea of meeting came up. We would go for coffee, get a bite to eat. She'd never seen game of thrones before. I offered to let her watch. Things got intimate. I performed horribly. Never heard from her again.

What a great way to remember losing one's virginity...

That left me in a rejection induced rut for a couple weeks. Abandoned my NoFap goal. A friend of mine knew what was going on and introduced me to a friend of hers. 

She was beautiful, funny, artistic. We hit it off almost immediately. We went on many dates over the course of the next few months. Talked about a great many things. We ended up in each others beds very often.

My performance started off strong and began to deteriorate. She knew I'd had problems in the past. She seemed supportive and wanted to help me through it. I thought I'd found someone who got it. 

I was wrong.

She never said it directly but I knew my inability to perform was a key reason. She left me. She sat me down for breakfast. We talked. Had a few laughs. We drove out to where we first kissed. And she told me that it wasn't working out. That it wasn't anything I did, but that she was no good for me.

About a week later she's officiated on Facebook that she's in a relationship with *new boyfriend*, a coworker of hers that she invited to crash at her appartment a week prior to the breakup because he had nowhere else to go. 

I spent the next 4 months in a deep depression. My friends could see it. My coworkers could see it. My family could see it. I couldn't get out of it. I felt alone, unloved, useless. A husk of a man walking about the world as though he still had a reason to. 

Porn was a constant source of pain reduction. And it felt so different. Before, I would indulge because I enjoyed the feeling. But after the time I spent with the real deal, it just wasn't the same. I was chasing a ghost in hopes of just getting out of the hole I'd found myself in.

And something happened. I stopped. The porn wasn't working. It wasn't making me feel better, it was making me feel worse. I started reflecting on all the shit that left me where I was. And as the desire to chase the ghost slipped away, sense started filtering back to the forefront of my mind.

I realized I'd let the idea of being loved be my reason for the pursuit of love. I wanted validation through someone else's feelings for me. I'd let the idea into my head that my self worth was only attainable by my ability to find a partner.

So I bought a puppy. She's all the affection I need. Training her, taking her for walks, playing with her is occupying a lot of the free time I used to have, eliminating many avenues of relapse.

So forget hookups and fake women. I'm not doing that anymore. To hell with that. Yes, I've relapsed a few times since then but it wasn't done out of depression. I'm still trying to fill in the blank spaces of my schedule with meaningful activity. 

As new years came around I let myself relapse one more time before midnight. I walked into 2019 knowing full well I was done with bullshit people and fake love found on a screen. I'll live for me and my dog.

And somewhere along the lines of reclaiming my self worth, I had a bit of a realization. I've eliminated words like ""fairness"" and ""deserve"" from my vocabulary. 

I dont believe I deserve anything. None of us do. Deserving anything means I'm owed something by someone. Why? Because I should be happy like everyone else? Yeah right. Who the hell else is actually happy in this world?

So no. I don't deserve better love. Better people. Better things. A better life. I don't deserve any bit of it.

I demand it of myself.

So here's to a year of NoFap. Here's to real change and real growth. Here's to 2019, the year I finally figure out my actual worth.

May your 2019 be the best year ever.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean placebo is absolutely real but **only** if you believe in it. And i dont even believe in god,  carma and other half-true stuff. Im in nofap community since 2 years i think and i failed NNN 2017 when it was just a meme and in 2018 i finally got it + i lasted even longer (till january). (in total **2 months nofap**).

&amp;#x200B;

**The changes for me**

Its true that the longer you go the easier it gets but the only thing changed for me is the erectile dysfunction wich is unnecessary cause i dont have a gf.

But after years of waiting i finally asked my only female coworker out. Unfortunately she refused me cause she´s more the family person (and im the adventure person) and im going to change my shift on monday since i cant look into her eyes anymore. Im still going to reach my goals. I still eat what i eat. I still do my daily longboard tour and i need 7 more countries to visit till i reach 30 in total. (im 25). Nothing is different than before nofap except that my shift will start on another day now ;=)

&amp;#x200B;

So when nothing changes and the medical view sees masturbation absolute positive idk what to do now. I could continue stopping or fapping again right now. Its the moment on the cliff if i should jump or not.

12263,Question to NoFap,Looking for advice for long term goals.,"I find myself being very inpatient in life, and in a lot of aspects of it. Relating to NoFap, I want to improve and I want to be where the people on 90+ day streaks are and the benefits of them. I relapsed yesterday. Not on porn but just masterbating due to stress of assignment writing. I didn’t come from the experience in a negative mind frame just off the one I’m in writing this. 

How do I keep myself motivated to push for something I don’t know exists or something which I have experienced and assuming the outcome from. I’m not sure what I’ll be like in 90 days+, I just know it’s going to be somewhere better then where I am now. 

I read a post a moment ago about pushing for self improvement over girls and to me a goal of mine is just to be sexually healthy but I tend to get lonely and before reaching my targets, pursue girls and fail at the next hurdle because I’m rushing for something I haven’t achieved yet.

12357,Question to NoFap,A Pornfree day counter might be helpful for some people...thoughts?,"Don’t think this would work for everyone but I’ve personally been thinking that having another Pornfree counter (on top of the NoFap counter here) is an important supplement to NoFap.  I’ve noticed myself often adopting an all-or-nothing mentality when I feel unable to resist an urge, thinking “Well, if I’m going to mess up, might as well go all the way.”

Obviously, this is terrible reasoning and worse than just M, but if you know you’re going to have to restart your NoFap counter anyway I think it’s easier to think like this.   But if you have a Pornfree counter that you care about too, then you’ll be more motivated to just M so as not to lose your Pornfree streak too.

Of course, our goal here is to ultimately quit all of this behavior—I’m not saying this is a permanent solution or anything.  But I would rather give into an urge through just M than through P and M.  Porn is a unique monster that should be avoided for so many reasons.

12418,Journal Check-In,NoFap + Dopamine Diet - Day 6 of 90 - Oily Hair,"**NoFap rules:**

\- No PMO

\- Will avoid looking at any explicit images

\- Dopamine Diet (No Social media / Entertainment / gaming etc. Only this Reddit Journal is allowed)

**My Story:**

\- Age: 23

\- Have consumed pornography since age 13 ( before I could ejaculate)

\- Currently masturbate 2/3 times in one session every 2 to 3 days.

\- Hair thinning on top (sides are fine)

\- Low confidence/ self esteem

\- Lack of motivation to talk with women. (Never had a girlfriend.)

\- Social anxiety

**End goal:**

*My goal is to get a girlfriend and overcome the above.*

**Noticed Changes:**

\- Depression (Day 3, 4, 5)

\- Hair gets oilier faster (Day 6)

\- Facial hair growing faster (Day 6)

\- Slight acne (Day 6)

**Day 6 of 90:**

I noticed that I woke up with oily hair this morning even though I showered yesterday. It normally takes my hair a few days to become that oily. I also woke up with a pimple on my face, I normally don't have any acne and have not had any since I was a teenager so this was unusual. I also noticed that my facial hair had grown faster than usual overnight. I shaved clean yesterday like I normally do but woke up this morning with maybe just under what I would compare to is 2 days of facial hair growth, maybe slightly less. 

In terms of mindset, I don't feel as bad as I felt in the last 2 days. I felt neutral, I still had anxiety when talking to people but I think I can overcome it eventually if I work on it. With less dopamine in my system I get this strange sensation in my mind as if a huge chunk of something is missing or some sort of huge emptiness/ void. Sex drive is still very manageable, only a slight increase since yesterday.

Doing NoFap so far has led me to come to some realisations, for example: I now realise that my body and mind going through life was like a car with an engine that was on fire and smoking heavily and instead of fixing it, I would glue shut the hood. Another thing I realised was how negative my thoughts were. From now on I will try to consciously disagree or block any self criticism or negative thoughts. 

Another thing I forgot to mention originally was that alongside NoFap I am on a dopamine diet meaning I have disabled social media and am not been consuming any form of entertainment (YouTube etc...).",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aezn40/nofap_dopamine_diet_day_6_of_90_oily_hair/
12421,New to NoFap,Porn will really mess you up,"So first off I have been addicted to porn for as long as I can remember. I wanna say that it started in 4th grade, and I'm 25 now. My grandpa found out I was watching it a few years later and tried to warn me. He gave me the schpeel about how it will ruin sex and of course I was young (I wanna say 7th or 8th grade at this point) and I want having sex so I ignored his warning because I was young and knew everything and old people are stupid. Well fast forward to present day and one thing I can say with absolute certainty is that he was right. Eventually the same old stuff didn't work for me and I had to find new and exciting things to watch to keep my ""interest"". The things I have fapped to disgust me; shemale, prolapse, triple fisting, fake (I hope) rape videos, incest, and some of you probably know about those ""absurdity of Japanese porn"" videos. But as with any addiction I justified it, often with a simple ""not a big deal"" to make myself feel better. I have masturbated in church, bars, work, school, in the back seat of the car when my parents were driving, you name it. I always feel dirty and ashamed after, especially when I'm happily married and have a decent sex life. But now I have issues in bed; I am going to town on my wife watching her moan and all that other fun stuff that SHOULD keep me going, and I'm trying to watch videos in my head just to stay hard. I can't do it anymore. If I keep it up eventually she will find out and that will put a strain on the marriage if it doesn't straight up ruin it. So I have finally decided that as difficult as it will be, porn has to go. Better late than never right? Well yesterday was one full day of no porn or fapping. I know it's a small step but at least I'm trying to change. 

TL;DR: Got addicted to porn at a young age, eventually couldn't sex my wife without thinking of nasty shit, no more fap. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aezp56/porn_will_really_mess_you_up/

12453,Advice to NoFap,You’re probably the cause of most of your problems.,"You have done this to yourself. You have got yourself addicted to porn. You have found this subreddit, you have made the choice to watch porn again, and again. And again. It’s not porn that’s done this to you, it’s not the urges, it’s not the horniness, it’s you.

Back at the height of my addiction, my porn tastes were morphed into something I didn't even want to think of. I could only jerk off with the weird stuff and vanilla was too plain.

However I forced myself at the time to make do with vanilla, and I had some symptoms like i was flatlining.

Not giving my brain the dopamine it craved by watching the old stuff and ignoring novelty, I started to lose interest and get depressed. I was irritable and libido wasn't there at all.

12500,Advice to NoFap,Most people are forgetting something...,"Everyone is talking about the benefits of NoFap such as better confidence, better sleep, better focus, less brain fog, ED cured etc.

But ladies and gentlemen, we as a community are forgetting that stopping fapping and watching pornography saves so much time!!!!

If you were watching porn for 1 hour a day ( which I’m sure many of you were watching more, such as 2 hours)

If you avoid 1 hour of porn a day, you are freeing up 365 hours which is another 15 days of the year! 

If you watched 2 hours a day, you will be saving 30 days of your year! That’s almost 10% of the whole year on porn, and if you minus sleep, a 2 hour a day porn addict can use the 15% of their year that was filled with porn to something that’s not poison.

Consider starting music, drawing, salsa dancing classes ( girls love a man who can dance ), make yourself a more interesting person ( learn how to cook your favourite dish! WOMEN LOVE A MAN WHO CAN COOK! They dig that stuff! 

It doesn’t have to be a hard dish, just cook what you love, maybe represent a part of your personality in that dish!

Consider wearing a piece of clothing that reveals an interesting part of yourself! 

The other day, one of my school friend zoned girls asked me what the shark tooth was on my neck and where I got it from! I told her I got it from Mauritius, and a whole conversation grew from there!

Gents, to summarise:

Learn to dance (salsa) Women dig that
Learn to cook a favourite dish!
Buy a piece of clothing that separates you from the crowd! It can be a great conversation starter!

But most of all, beautiful people, remember that if you don’t experience any benefits, remember that you could be saving up to 15 days of your year by not choking the chicken or fingering the kitten!

Stay strong soldiers!

\-lack of a set gym/fitness workout routine

I've had this habit for as long as I can remember and I've never been proud of it. Every time felt like a relapse, even if I hadn't made the intention to quit.

I started reading this sub and I've never seen so much positivity.

I'm super OCD/ perfectionist/ procrastinator about starting things like new habits and projects on rounded numbers, but I think that has only let me put off what I really need to do and that is to stop this madness!

12866,Success Story,Survived Softcore Edging (and you can too),"Welp, as the title states, I managed to survive an episode of softcore edging that was well on it's way to becoming a relapse. Of course, with the help of the Nofap community and countless stories I was able to gain better control of my libido and resisted it, for now.

Although, I'd like to point out something interesting. Even though I was getting a dopamine rush, it did not last longer than 5 minutes despite my brain technically ""getting what it wanted"", I find it amusing how my brain has desensitized so much that it gets rapidly bored of softcore stuff, which ironically, massively helped resisting this urge.

I've already taken some countermeasures against porn (which at this point in time may be the only thing capable of causing relapse), so I'm quite satisfied with my ability to resist softcore porn, provided I can muster enough willpower (or hope that my brain gets bored of it in case I run into it lol), and read more informative and hopeful nofap posts.

Lastly and most importantly, I'd like to introduce an unorthodox way of dispelling temptation, and that, is causing fear inside your brain (which to some extent was applied here.) I'd like to mention that it's quite effective, and I surely doubt that whatever side effect it may have, it surely isn't anywhere near as bad as a PMO relapse.

I always feared that sharing my secret would make me feel judged and ashamed. But for my surprise, he understood me. As we went over it, I felt a great relief, as in “I finally did it”, because there was nothing more to hide. Now I feel that porn is a thing of the past, I no longer have to fight with it, because I already defeated it, now I only have to keep it on the ground and dont let it rise.

-For you reading this, have my word, IT IS POSSIBLE to overcome porn. Put discipline and determination into staying away from it, make each day count, occupy yourself, work out, read a book, learn something new!!!.

-a dash of energy boost (it's not the biggest boost but it keeps me up and running a tad bit more than before)

That's probably it for now, the weekend has come and for me it has always been challenging to not fap during the weekends even tho I try to keep myself as  occupied as possible. I would still normally fap during the weekends since I either do a lot or not do shit. That would end now tho, looking forward to that. I'll start reading more,setting more goals, and setting up a schedule to start on good habits.

13089,Motivate Me,Getting into a Bad Loop.... Help,"Hey guys so I'm getting into a loop I'm not sure how to get out of it.I have some  chronic anxieties in the subconscious level and also feel like I'm numb to everything, like I hardly feel joy or feel excited about anything. Even porn is boring for me, even though it does the trick some times.I am relatively successful contrary to what some people may think, and I also have a fiance now who is living overseas.(I have to wait over a year for her to come live with me).See, I don't really hate my life, and but at the same time Im not super motivated to make things better either. Im pretty comfy.

I know that to get better in terms of numbness and anxiety, I need to stay away from porn, but the constant numbness brings me back to porn from time to time because I feel like my life has nothing exciting. How do I get out of this without feeling like killing my self?

Any thoughts? ideas?

13122,Advice to NoFap,Read books before sleeping,"Two years ago, when I wasn't yet on NoFap, I would PMO every single night (and more times a day). It rarely slept before 03.00, meanwhile I had to get up every day at 07.00. This means less then 4 hours of sleep a day(!). I felt like a zombie, so I decided to try NoFap. This didn't go pretty well, I just couldn't fetch sleep, I kept thinking about all random stuff until like 04.00. After this I was like ""just crank one out, and then I can sleep"". And so it was.

After I discovered that I needed to O in order to sleep, I tried to just MO without P. At first I wasn't even able to do this because I never O'ed without P. So I had to train myself, everyday softer porn, then pictures, then non-pornograpic pictures, until I was finally able to MO with only my fantasy.

This was a HUGE improvement, if you MO without P there isn't the urge to just keep going and watch more porn. Then it's just O as fast as possible and it's over. So if I got to bed at 23.00 I was done with fapping on 23.15 and was asleep on 23.30.

After done this a couple of months I felt much better, but I wanted to go even further by not fapping at all. I discovered that reading has the same effect as fapping, it will calm your mind and help you stop thinking about all random stuff. You don't even have to read much, just a couple of pages.

I started the habit of reading about a year ago, and every morning I feel more energized and it's easier to get out of bed. I don't read a lot this way, in this year I've only read four books. But it isn't about reading a lot, it is about fetching sleep. And thereby, every single page of these books have teach me more then all those years of porn.


If I may suggest you a book: Watership Down by Richard Adams. It goes about a group of rabbits who have to find a new home, this sound childish, but it isn't, they murder each other and shit.

For whoever gives a fuck: the other books I've red are: Tales form Watership Down also by Richard Adams, Max Havelaar by Multatuli and A Never-ending Story by Michael Ende.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/af64i7/read_books_before_sleeping/

It was the worst feeling ever once I realized what I did, yesterday. I failed NN’19 and It started off soo good....
‘On the bright sight’ it wasn’t straight up P (at least no nudity (social media is soo dangerous nowadays)). I was just surfing the Internet and was bored and couldn’t sleep ~1:00am and then the dopamine took over and my brain was just standing by and watch it happen.... 
Day 0 - again 
NoNut’19 - failed . . . . 

Nevertheless I won’t give up and as far as I’ve seen, I’m not the only one failing NN’19. That’s why I propose a new NN’19 challenge (for all those who have failed already): Don’t PMO more than 3 times this year. If you make it, you will have at least once achieved the goal of hitting 90 Days!!

I've been doing NoFap on and off for the last two years. My first streak was the longest and somehow easiest, but then I fell down a chain of relapse periods. I'm nowhere near infallible.

This time around I kind of slipped back into it with the inspiration of someone in my life. It's mostly out of respect for this person, but hey, everybody needs a crutch.

So over two weeks in and I've hit a flatline wall for the first time. I'm feeling tired, uninspired, anxious, possibly mildly depressed and I can't really feel aroused anymore. My biggest trigger is.. well it doesn't matter, but I encountered it twice yesterday and.. nothing. I went home in the evening, sought it out, felt maybe very mildly aroused but still. I'm out of air.

It's also interesting that for the first time I could sit with the fleeting feeling of being turned on and recognize it for what it is. A mere bodily sensation, for which I don't have to do anything. It's a powerful way to break out of this habit loop.

My personal best ""streak"" was 115 days and let me tell you, I felt great! The energy, the free time, loss of brain fog, increased confidence, and many more I experienced. 
   Fast forward 2018 and I only pmo'd three or four times all year!! But guys, coming from a once 2 to 3 time a dayer like me man I'm so proud of myself for overcoming the beast. Overcoming my P issue was the hardest thing I've done in my life. I didn't go to a doctor or therapist but I did get a accountability partner along the way. 
   She was a long time abuser of meth who when I met her had been clean a few years. I met her through mutual friends at a church. Talking to her openly about my problem HELPED dealing with the shame I felt being a pmo addict. Most importantly I prayed and kept the faith. 
   Fast forward 2019 I don't feel I have the problem anymore. Now my plan is to not only stay away from pmo(given) but to be celibate. I'm thinking 6 months to a year. I want to focus strictly on self improvement and success.

I sent her messages and at some point she stopped responding. Her mother spoke to me and told me that my girlfriend's cell phone had been stolen. 

At that time I was very scared but I was on my fourth day of no fap so I had a lot of energy. I took a bicycle with deflated tires, a cell phone in disuse to give her and some money ... and I went on that bike in poor condition to her home. 

Almost at the beginning of the journey my legs hurt a lot and I was dehydrated, but since I had not masturbated I had a lot of energy and I was determined to go see my girlfriend. 
I do not know how I did it but I got to my girlfriend's house like in twenty or thirty minutes. 
She was fine and her father came back from the hospital at night. 

With this story I want to show you that no fap is more than a challenge. Otherwise I would probably have stayed at home watching porn to be unconcerned about my girlfriend. 
But i was determined to see her and accompany her in a difficult moment, regardless if that meant using a bicycle in bad condition and pedaling for half an hour.

After being on a 15 day streak since christmas, I felt amazing and experienced loads of no fap benefits, my shyness is still there but apart from that I felt rejuvenated, happy, energetic and most importantly anxiety and brain fog were gone. 

But then.... like I said previously an explict few images of the average female on twitter. Then a post about someones sex life (these I usually come across of this sub aswell and I HATE SUCH POSTS) this all lead me to drumroll.... 

porn hub. Yes, for one and a half hour I watched a variety of porm videos after every video I promised myself Im not going to fap. Lol how pathetic. Anyways after the 1.30 hour my phone died and I went to the washroom to clean whatever discharge had been released because of the porn. Then I started to MO.

I absolutely hate myself right about now. I'm emotionally drained but everytime I see something triggering if thats on tv, social media, or even in public I remind myself of three words:

Determination
Dedication
And Discipline.

This is mostly for myself so that I can look back at it when I feel urges. HOWEVER to everyone who has failed no nut nineteen already, dont worry it is not the end of the world or the year, it is just the beginning reset your counter and march on, remember this is a fight to make yourself the best possible person you can become have a goal and vision in your head. 

I have realised that this goal in your head doesn't have to be 90 days right from the start. I failed about 10, 15+ day plus streaks thinking 90 days is too far. So I am noe taking it week by week. Friday to friday. Take it day by day. My goal is to reach tommorow without pmo, looking too far ahead on the road will mean you cant see any bumps and potholes that are close to you. Therfore take it day by day, week by week and eventually we will all reach 90 and start to live our best life. Remember:

But nothing worked so far and this is going to be my next hope.

I'm going to document my days and see if this gets me the motivation to quit porn.

So......this is how my day went so far.

Woke up late (like at 12pm). I went on and did my usual routines like brushing my teeth and all that stuff.
I studied a bit (my exams are coming up) after that spent my time till noon on the phone watching youtube. I got really bored so was about to watch porn but my brother asked me to play some badminton with him and so I did. After playing went home and went on YouTube (again....I think youtube might become a problem for me). Got bored again so I watched porn and then was about to take a bath but decided to watch it again. Then after feeling like shit I decided to take a bath. After the bath I had some biscuits and tea. Then studied a bit and after that I went on my phone to youtube (again) and watched porn afterwards. Then after a while I told myself this is enough and now I'm writing this post. 

I know my life is sad but I am willing to change it. So that's why I wanted to post this.

I’m starting my journey, I’ll be posting here daily. I’m brand new to Reddit so I’m not sure how I’ll do it, but I’ll figure it out.

This addiction has taken over my life and seeped into everything else. It’s time for this bullshit to stop. Why the fuck is it so difficult? I don’t know, but I don’t want it anymore. 

I would really appreciate support from you guys, even if I don’t, posting on here would just create accountability for myself and that is the utmost important.

13508,Question to NoFap,Just stopping porn (at first),"So my biggest issue has always been with porn. I never had any issue getting up and staying up with my SO, but I could NEVER finish - even if I was masturbating with her. Only thing that was “missing”
was the porn. 

I tried to cut out PM in 2018 multiple times but could never really go past a week. 

Since the 1st of Jan I was going to cut both out again, but messed up by the 3rd... however I didn’t look at porn. 

I have masturbated a couple times since then (still way down from my normal daily) but still without porn. 

I never used to be able to masturbate without porn. 

So my question to noFap is do you guys think this is a good path?

Focus on removing porn from the equation and then start transitioning from masturbation to traditional sex as that’s the end goal here. To be able to finish with my SO not cutting out O all together. 

I fear that if I were to try and stop cold turkey again I would just do both and be stuck again.

NoFap has made me happier and much more productive. It's awesome. But at random times during the day, I have those sexual thoughts in my mind or some old porn scenes replay sometimes in my brain. This makes me aroused and when I think of those, I can hardly concentrate on my study. I've tried meditation and yes it can work, but not really. Perhaps it's my inconsistence.

13556,New to NoFap,NoFap - Day1/Year1,"Good day to you! I hope you are doing well!

&amp;#x200B;

I started NoFap today after years of denial that I have an addiction to porn. I'm in my 2nd year of university and I'm perceived by my university peers to be a great student. I regularly contribute to class discussions, I do work to a high standard, my peers ask me for advice; above the surface everything seems to be going ok. The problem is that during the times when I'm back at home trying to study, I use masturbation as a coping mechanism, especially when I'm stressed. I masturbate the most when deadlines are due and when I'm supposed to be studying, I can masturbate from *5-10 times a day* and it is *seriously* impacting on my grades/ quality of life, I must have wasted hundreds of hours masturbating over the years when I could've been studying or enjoying a meaningful hobby. To me, porn/ masturbation isn't even about sex anymore, it's about getting that dopamine hit just so I can 'function properly' (much like a typical alcohol/ drug addict) and lift my brain-fog/ irritability. As soon as I orgasm my mind is cleared and I'm able to study again, but only for a short period of time, then the regret/ negative thoughts start setting, which in turn makes me want to masturbate even more as a form of escapism.

People are always perplexed when they see me hand in my work late or when I haven't done enough work, because in their eyes I should be one of the students setting the example. Nobody knows about my addiction other than my father, I recently confided to him what's been happening and it felt great, I'm just afraid to tell someone at university incase word gets out and rumours start to spread; many people don't understand addictions either, especially porn addiction. I've even had to apply for extensions on projects as well because I haven't done the correct amount of work in time. Anyway, that's just the tip of the iceberg and there's plenty more parts of my life which the addiction has affected as well.

I wasn't thrown into a slump.  I wasn't down and hating myself.  I didn't feel like I was drowning in sorrow and self loathing.  I didn't despise myself or feel that void in my gut.  I didn't feel like I could never succeed.

I felt like I stumbled over a stone on my long path to sobriety and fell to the ground.  But this time the ground wasn't comfortable and the thoughts to give in forever did not shake me.

7 days of no PMO, haven’t come this far in 110 or so days. currently, i haven’t had any massive, life-destroying urges and im amazed why not because i still have instagram installed and that app is a trap (uninstall it now if possible, i haven’t uninstalled because it’s my only way of keeping in touch with old friends). 

now the part people want to hear about - the benefits: 


* none so far.

yep, haven’t had any so far apart from slight confidence increase and somewhat better quality sleep (still not amazing and im not waking up feeling refreshed). i’m not expecting benefits from nofap alone and neither should you as it really doesn’t do anything or give you anything. nofap is just a catalyst for change. 


for those struggling to hit 7 days, try and keep yourself occupied at all times, i was only ever in my bedroom when studying or sleeping. go to school, go to the gym, go outside with friends (all things i did to keep urges away and stay occupied) and you won’t feel the need to have a wank. honestly, at your age (however old you maybe), why do you still feel the need to watch a man and woman fuck each other on your computer/phone/tablet etc. we need to be actual men, not little boys. 


should i update you guys later when i hit 14 days? or was this kinda cringe? let me know,

13993,Relapse Report,My brain keeps me from succeeding,"tl;dr rant about myself consciously relapsing over and over again

This post doesn't really help/motivate anyone, but I just wanted to get this thought out there:

I'm 17 and I have been doing NoFap for a year now. I have never had a streak higher than 6 days. Before I found this sub a few months ago they were even down to 1 or 2 days. And only now as I have just failed again on the 6th day I realized who's making me lose the challenge all the time.

It's my brain. I wonder if anyone else here experiences their relapse in the same way that I do: Whenever I get in touch with suggestive material just a tiny bit and I start thinking about going to some porn site and buffing the banana, my brain tells me that everything will be fine. You could legit compare it with a voice inside my head.

It tells me things like ""It's just peeking."" ""You're not going to be captured by the downward spiral."" ""You've edged before, you're going to get it right this time."" ""Just keep going and stop before you cum.""

It lulls me with these beliefs. My brain is literally split up: One half is the conscious one, aware that I am witnessing myself relapse. The other half is the BEAST whispering into the Woodsman's ear (any OTGW fans?) and I can't shut it down. It's hypnotizing me, taking control over my willpower and my hands are tied.

I have tried plenty of things. Suppressing urges, distracting myself, setting up an adult filter, visiting this sub etc. help me to escape a relapse occasionally, but I eventually end up unable to do any of those things. At some point, I run out of things to distract myself with, get bored of this sub after staying for too long, the BEAST commands me to peek, making me deactivate the filter and so on.

If it wasn't for those voices (still sounds weird putting it like that, I swear I'm not crazy, please) I'd easily get 10 days minimum. But there I am, back at day 1. I feel miserable.

What's making you relapse? Is anyone else sharing my experiences? And how do you shut the voice down?

I regret wasting all those years and what I could have become. I’m proud of what I accomplished and cringe at the disgusting habit that ran my life. The  things I used to do to get the rush. Nothing worth mentioning. I can say I’m far along the road now and couldn’t revert to my old ways. Rewiring is complete. Pied is 75% gone. Morning wood is nearly every morning. I was scared and anxious on day one. But momentum is the secret. Small steps and wins chain together. Never fully relapsed. Peeked early on and today if I bring up porn, it doesn’t trigger any reaction. I look at the thumbnails and only see degraded filth and I am completely turned off. 

Not sure if this is a pep talk or advice. I’ve offered a lot of that on here for the past 4 months. You all have made the journey bearable. It’s far easier to have companions on any trip. I’m not going anywhere. Going to continue into this uncharted territory.

14234,Emergency - Help!,Lacking in the sausage department,"Throwaway for privacy. 21(m)

I need your help. My mental health is draining.

Been with a girl for a year, she's my cup of tea. I care about her a lot.

From the very beginning, my penis has not worked reliably FOR A YEAR. We met this week back in 2018.

Very first time, limp dick no sexy times. Next dozen times.. limp dick no sexy times. I can fight the situation with a good lickaroo for the lady, but still demoralizing none-theless.

Met her after 4 months of being single after another long term relationship, couple dates with other girls in-between, no sex with them however on their own conviction.

I have had GOOD sex with my current girlfriend a handful of times(half a dozen MAYBE) over this year. I make sure she gets off, but more often than not I either come instantly, or can get it up at all.

What is constituting good in my mind is around 5-10 minutes of full erection sex, nothing crazy, just average 21 year old guy sex with foreplay preceeding.

I have tried a 30 days no PMO. 
I have tried supplements recommended by Reddit threads. 
Tried increasing cardio. 
Tried light lifting three times a week. 
Tried decreasing caffeine, even cold turkey for a month in August. (I drink quite a bit, including monster energy drinks). 
Tried sleeping more. 
Tried jerking off  hours before sex. 
Worst thing I eat is pizza on occasion, too broke to get fast food often. Plenty of vegetables, fruits, water.
Smoked weed more than I drank, and even quit that habbit beginning in December 2018.

I'm sure all of these methods take time, but even trying them for up to a month at a time, some simultaneously, still had little to no results.
Keep in mind this is a new girlfriend over this year, still have to have SOME sexual activity so I couldn't FULL 90 RESET. I'm also 21 this really shouldn't be a problem even with 3-4 PMOs a week.. right? I also have not any problems since I've been sexually active starting at age 16. This issue started 2018, haven't changed any PMO habbits since I was 14.

I assumed it was depression initially. Tried to steer my mind to a happier place over the year, and succeeded, life is better. 

Only thing I haven't done.. doctors appointment. I'm afraid of a ED medication perscription. I'm a healthy adult male from what I gather, I shouldn't need a pill.

Nothing seems to work. Dick seems to just work when it wants to. Even when it does, I cum within a dozen thrusts. With a condom, same story, 2 pump chump.

The reason I resort to posting my own story is tonight, I got her ready by getting her to come with my mouth. Put the condom on my semi. Tried to put it in my holding my dying erection like a balloon animal, came in 2 thrusts. Played it off like I couldn't get it up.. with my girlfriend of a year.

TLDR;(21m) 2 pump chump, and that's if I can even get it up. Tried all the Google search methods out there. She can get me up, but I can't do it like I used to. 

Help me.

14342,Journal Check-In,End of Day 30 Log - Looking for advice/ideas for constant anxiety &amp; hopeless loneliness for short term (months),"So I made it through the entire winter vacation without any romance/sex fantasy, porn, or masturbating. It was a lot easier because I was home, but the fact that it was almost three weeks is amazing. That's my longest streak in idk how long.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been back at college again for a week now and it's hard. I'm more aware of my emotional state because of some growth over the past month. I'm stressed and anxious all the time, and feeling hopelessly lonely whenever I relax. It's a really unhealthy state to be in. Two nights in a row this week I masturbated when I was almost asleep and my brain had stopped thinking rationally. I put a stop to it immediately after and haven't done so since. Last night I started fantasizing, mostly romance but edging into sex. That was a red flag too and I'll not allow it tonight. I'm not really sure whether to count those as relapses. If it becomes a habit I definitely will, but if it's an isolated incident that's another confusing thing that I'm not sure how to count. I'm definitely doing way better than before.

&amp;#x200B;

More than ever it's clear to me that PMO is a coping mechanism for me. I feel terrible. Constantly being either anxious or depressingly lonely is not healthy and not sustainable. Well, it probably is sustainable for much longer than I'd like it to be. I need a way out. I graduate this year but that's months away, and this might still be a problem afterwards; living back home probably won't be the same as vacationing there. I'm seeking counseling/therapy but it'll be at least a week before I can start, and probably longer. IDK what to do.

14531,New to NoFap,"Day 2 NoFap challenge, starting again with this experiment for the sake of science.","Hello everybody. I have read a lot of testimonials about the benefits of NoFap and I got intrigued by this. I heard of it around 1 year ago when it became kind of a trend in the meme community so I paid little attention to it.  However, after reading a lot of testimonials of men getting benefited by it, I decided to do a research. I found little to no evidence of the benefits. According to the experts and most studies, the only negative effects of masturbating come when you do it too many times.Ok, so ignoring that, I tried doing no fap several months ago and after a few tries I gave up at 1 week. I saw no benefits other than increased sexual desire, which caused me to talk to more girls. On the other side, my depression remained and I couldn't even concentrate on work due to the high sexual desired I had.That said, I'm going to try again now that I have found some ""tricks"" to reduce the horniness (cold shower, inmediate exercise, taking a walk).This experiment is aimed to reach from 1 month to 40 days without ejaculating, as most practitioners say you see the effects after the first month. I trust science, but I need to try this myself before giving any conclusion.

Today I'm at day 2 after 1 relapse.

14591,Article,A man looked at porn in a movie I watched and it made me seriously reflect on myself.,"So I just finished watching a movie on Netflix called “The girl with all the gifts”. Without saying too much it’s an apocalypse movie where humans are pretty much bottom of the food chain now. There was a scene where this really cool character went out looking for food to bring back to others, he ended up finding a SevenEleven type corner-store absolutely packed with long life food. What he didn’t know was he was being hunted at the time. At first he ate a bit and then he was about to grab a bunch to take back until he noticed a shelf full of porno mags. Now I know some of you might not think a mag is too bad but in my eyes porn is porn. He ended up looking through them (and he looked pretty creepy while doing so, makes me wonder what I look like). The thing is, if he had left the store without stopping to read through them he probably would’ve made it back safe to the others, but of course he didn’t and he ended up dying while perving on photos of naked women. I don’t really know how to put it, but it really made me look quite hard at myself and by porn habits. A weird post I know but I just wanted to share with you all and maybe hear your thoughts?

Some background: I've tried NoFap back in 2016 with some successes (over 2 month streaks and then no porn usage for over a year with imagination as my Ersatz plus relationship). However, some few months ago I felt down and relapsed into daily porn usage (it started with watching once in a while). This year, however, I'm clean.

I forgot how great my life was when I first started with NoFap, I feel like a child again. I'm less of a doormat for people at work and in general in life, I get more positive/sexual attention from my fiance and female colleagues at work, my mind is clear and focused. 

I can keep discipline in diet (not fat, I'm Chad-built, but I'm on keto and doing pushups regime) and tasks that I need to complete, my physique got better - less fat, manlier face and better muscle. I walk confidently, because I'm not ashamed of myself 24/7/365.

The biggest profit though was that I regained my interest in spiritual development and I'm back in the game to attain the goal of becoming boddhisatva in this lifetime.

I know this addiction has destroyed big parts of your lives too.
Just try to endure. If you fail, go again. Maybe it wont happen tomorrow. Maybe it wont happen a year from now. But one thing is sure, one day youll succeed. 
And when the time has come youll look back at all the hopeless nights alone and all the dull days in this world and you will know it was worth it. 

Guys, I never had a streak longer than 2,5 months. I never had all my bad habits in check.
I'm not the guy thats faultless.

I had the sudden realization that I was addicted to porn, it’s a weird feeling getting a sudden change on perspective on something that has been a part of your life for a long time at the age of 23. I still remember finding my older brothers dirty magazines at a very young age 5/6yrs. Probably started pmo not long after discovering masturbating, at the age of 13 I have done it most days before bed and never thought anything of it. It felt like a natural part of life. Since discovering the community I have done my best to abstain, but would relapse every two weeks or so, but have drastically cut down how frequently I pmo. This year I want to try something different. Simply no pmo and no watching porn. I’ll still jerk off every now, but treat it like sex with myself, make it special you know, but this year I will not watch porn.

I know it is hard to do but I just could not look at myself everyday in the morning.
These 3 days have been really hard but I know I need to finish this.(My goal is to no fap in 30 days and more ofcourse but 30 days is my first goal)
The reason why i started this challenge beacuse I had a DPDR and now i have brain fog.I searched online and the reason why i have a brain fog is beacuse of too much fapping.

However, when I watched, it was the same old depraved junk. As of now, I'm in a long distance relationship with a girl. We occasionally engage in sexting (It turns me on a lot. No problems there.) Now I want you guys to understand my problem. I have no issues with ADDICTION per se or even quantity. My problem is about the TYPE of porn I consume. So is it ok to jerk off specifically to these sexts (frequency would be twice a month) or will complete abstinence be better to rewire my brain? Thanks in advance.

14940,Motivation,Fighting hard,"(English is not my first tounge so sorry for any grammar or spealling mistakes)
I've never been the type of guy who gets depressed and I think I've never had any kind of depression (lucky me) but during all December I felt like shit and faped twice a day, also the porn I would watch was one of the most twisted shit I've ever seen. Nothing of it was real, it was sick and a feeling of regret would come right after the orgasm and it felt horrible
Here I want to post why I got to that point and why I'm doing NoFap.
I've had been watching porn since age 13 aprox and, like all drugs, as the time passed I had to go from one type of videos to another. Started with heterosexual porn, then lesbian, then shemale and gay wich I thought was fucked up (not that gays are bad but it's just not who I am).  The  feelings of lonliness, akwardness, sadness and despair had been present on my day to day life for so long I realized I was getting depressed and all my familly seemd to notice right away. They would ask me if everything was ok and I would respond with: ""yeah why you ask"" or ""I'm just tierd"" (typical excuses when you're sad).
All this went on from December to one day after new year were I just couldn't hold it any longer. We were in the kitchen late at night (11:15pm or so) and my mother asked me, as she had been doing constantly for the past month, if everything was ok and that something seemed off about me. I just busted in tears right on the spot and started telling my mother how I had been feeling during the last month. How I thought I was a loser, that I felt lonley because my friends don't seem to care about me and I've never had a girlfriend and that sucked.
We talked about how to solve this and arrived to the conclusion that I have to meet new people and that it wasn't that my friends don't cared about me but since I always refuse to meet with them at a party or something they eventually just stopped inviting me because I gave the impression that I didn't like to spend time with them. This conversation was a huge releif for me and I was finally able to see what things I had to change.
I started NoFap on the 8th of January because I understood that porn was, directly or indirectly, the cause of all my problems and that It has to disappear from my life for good. I must say that it has been one of the best choices I've made recently, my selfconfidence has impproved a lot to the point that I even invited a girl I'm kinda interested in to go out and, although it is clear that she is 100% not into me, I had a great time and looking for more partner options.
Currently I'm making an effort to go out with my friends whenever I can even if it means that I will spend the night with a glass half full of beer that I won't even drink just so I can laugh and have a good time.
NoFap is hard guys, the urges are strong and your mind will do everything to get you to fap and relapse but for me masturbating is returning to what made me feel like the shitiest person in the world and it should be the same for you. A guy from the NoFap site told me this: ""Will porn make me get the girl? NO
Will porn help me feel better? NO
Will porn solve my problems? NO
Porn gives you NOTHING""
These words have helped my in a way you can't imagine and I hope they help you too.

15012,Telling my Story,Where it all began!,"It all started 9 years ago, when I was 14. One of my friend told me about fapping and the boom. I didn't have access to internet, multimedia phone or pc. One year later my dad bought a multimedia phone. I discovered internet, worst of all I discovered porn. Everyday after he return from work, I use to take his phone, say I am playing game and sneak into my room and fap.

Then I got my own pc and you ofcourse know what followed. I never thought of refraining from PMO. Only when I completed my studies ie after graduation one day I was thinking about my life and found I have become poor in everything. Like there was a steep decline in my academic performance and my hobbies, I do nothing just videogames and fap and regular work. Nothing sort of interests me. I mean nothing. I began questioning myself and stumbled upon this NoFap back in 2017. I didn't pay much attention to it, cause I didn't believe that it can be the cause.

Only in 2018 I thought to give it a try, and found out yes I AM ADDICTED. I quit smoking in a day in 2018 but it I couldn't quit fapping. I couldn't hold more than 2 days without fapping. So I tried and tried and started to see 2 days to 3 days then a week. And now a couple of weeks. What I gained is concentration power, my hobbies, and a liking to workout and bycycling. I have changed a bit or a lot that I don't know, but I am happier than I was and have stopped playing videogames too.

I feel very less urges day by day, or I would rather say I can stare at the hypersexualized medias and wave em off. Thanks to everyone here. It couldn't have been made possible because of you all.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aflwdm/where_it_all_began/

I look at the idea of porn now and...it's just weird how I could attain pleasure from it. It also sucks when I masturbate coz I'm forcing myself and I don't experience any pleasure doing it funnily enough.

Giving up porn is a massive step for anyone. If giving masturbation is a step too far for you, just follow a similar pattern.

15227,Advice to NoFap,NOFAP IS UNFORTUNATELY UNNECESSARY:,"Men, after actively doing (Nofap) for 2 years i have come to the conclusion that none of us are really addicted to masturbation, (Porn Maybe) but not masturbation. and (NOFAP) is unfortunately, completely unnecessary!..

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, whats really happening is that our bodies have a natural response to when we have accumulated enough (seed) in our systems, and have built up enough testosterone, our bodies begin prompting us when we need to release some in order to keep from burning up on the inside and melting down!

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put, just live your life and enjoy yourself!. Once you have built up enough steam to keep running properly and efficiently (seed) you just need to release some to keep from melting down, and everything should be perfectly fine as long as you do not build up too much Testosterone and go past your 1st and 2nd prompts! which are actually (Surge's) of energy which act as warnings to let you know once you have enough and are completely full of energy, and need to release some, because the third ""Surge"" of energy is not a prompt or a warning it is the real deal!.. It is the (Meltdown) of your body which is why it is so huge and intense, i am sure you all have experienced that 1 BIG/MASSIVE ""Urge"" well that is actually your body reacting to you having built up too much testosterone, (NOT RELEASING) when you were warned and it is now causing a meltdown of your mind and body unfortunately!

&amp;#x200B;

So please heed this warning! As a Man.. a (Male) If you do not release some from your body you will unfortunately experience (Meltdowns) which are not cool!

&amp;#x200B;

So guys looks like we do not have to do Nofap for forever, constantly fighting these Surge's of energy unnecessarily!.. Just respond to the first warning, release some of the seed (Sperm-Testosterone-Semen) from your body either through masturbation or sex, and keep it moving!. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's really just that simple!...

&amp;#x200B;

15250,Confession,Im really scared to post this.,"So, to introduce myself, I am a 14 year old boy that's been addicted to porn since 10. I have been masturbating for the past 2 years. Yes, I'm so young and I'm watching porn. This addiction got out of control and I watched more hardcore videos everyday. I'd stay at home just to watch porn that's how BAD it became.

I have been trying to stop this for about a month, but my best streak is 7 days. This is my last day. I say goodbye to porn and all that bad stuff. I want to learn more. I'm really interested in maths, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science and music. I watch informative channels like vsauce and 3brown1blue everyday and I love it. I have been making music for about a year and a half almost 2 years. I want to make a career out of it. But why did I told you these things? It's because watching porn wasted my time when I could learn new things. I'm in love with learning new stuff, but my brain knows fapping produces more dopamine meaning I'm happier . We all want to be happy and so my brain tells me to do it again and again and again. I'm sorry brain, but no matter how smart you think you are, you are very easy to fool. 

And so, in conclusion, today is my last day of my miserable life and my first day of my new exciting fun life. Wish you all good luck and keep strong!

15412,Telling my Story,Tears of Joy.,"So guess what right? Here I am trying NoFap after my ex and I split almost 3 years ago, made the mistake of not dedicating my life to NoFap. The longest time I went without PMO was 24 days within 3 years. Relapse due to flatline.

&amp;#x200B;

However I made a pact that I would give NoFap a real good go in 2019, fully commit to being clean.  
The first week went by quite easily compared to other attempts due to me forcing myself to be clean in 2019, however the past week I have been in a super dead flatline and have not had any motivation or anything. Went to sleep quite late last night, around 1am... woke up today at 7:30 and I am (no exaggeration) feeling the best I have felt in so long its actually making me tear up from joy. 

Its only 8:40am right now and I have already eaten, had a shower, cleaned up the clothes in my room, about to wash my bedsheets and then go to the gym then university. Normally I'd sleep until 10:30am, shower then uni.

&amp;#x200B;

This sudden rush of motivation and hunger for life literally came overnight. I felt 5% yesterday and today I feel 95%.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still far from 90 days, however I now know this is life changing. For reference, I used to PMO minimum 4 times a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I almost lost hope during flatline, but my words to anyone and to myself in the future if I experience another flatline, is to trust in the process. The flatline will end and you will thank yourself for suffering through it.

&amp;#x200B;

Love love love you all and this community.

Family or not.

Today marked my first relapse... I have been addicted to porn for as long as i can remeber its like a curse that was cast on me by my sex ed teacher. ""Masterbating is normal"" they say but they dont tell you its a vice that will grab you and never let go. Ive transversed so far down the rabbit hole of porn that i dont think ill ever wipe my mind free of the images i have seen. It has come to the point that my dreams have become vivid and saturated as if i was going on T-break.

But during my first 7 day attempt ive never felt more motivated to focus on my academics and personal wellness. I used to mock this forum and anyone that spoke about it on the media. It seemed silly to have to join an ""AA group"" for porn. Until i came to grips with my addiction.

I will not fail again... becuase I WILL learn self control

Also is fapping without porn specifically for the purpose of ""clearing everything out."" counted as a relapse or no?

15577,Trioggers,ED at 22,"Hello everyone, I am sorry if this does not belong here but I really feel bad and I would really welcome some answers. I am 22 year old guy and I have quite serious ED. I do not have any morning erections, very very rarely get random bones and when I do, it is not really 100%. When I masturbate I can get hard but it is usually also not a 100% erection and I do not even get erection when I am with a girl. I am a virgin and just started dating girl that I always had a crush on. I have problems with erection for probably like 3 years but I was focusing on school and was not dating  (yes I am idiot that I did not try to solve it sooner). Now after a few dates with my girl, we aranged that she will come to place where I live. I knew that she wants to have sex so I started finally doing something about my problem and scheduled appointment with an urologist (Have to wait a month) asked my GP if I could get a viagra as an temporary fix. I got the Viagra and took the viagra (50 mg) 30 minutes before the sex. When the girl came over we were making out, then I was giving her oral and my penis stayed dead all the time anyway and I did not even feel aroused like if I did not really even had any sex drive. I tried masturbating to get erection and it worked but when I put on condom it got flacid very fast again.

I do not know that to do and I am really scared that I will not be able to have normal sex. I am also really worried because of my libido, I enjoy time spent with this girl so much and I find her incredibly attractive yet I do not really have any sex drive and arousal when I am doing w/e sexual with her. What do you think that could be a problem? Can it be something as simple as low testosterone or is there decent chance that my libido is just broken? I also tried NoFap like 6 months ago and lasted for about 5 weeks and my penis was dead the whole time. Thanks for any answers",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afpn02/ed_at_22/

Little bit of background : I've never been addicted to porn to the point it would ruin my social life. At some point in my life I got to go to a camp, where I couldn't fap at all due to proximity with others. Around that time I heard of Nofap. I've been trying to quit since then (2 years ago), with streaks of about 2 weeks each time. After reading ""Your Brain on Porn"", I decided to quit masturbation altogether. 

On the first month, I did indeed experience the ""high"" of increased motivation, confidence, etc. I've stopped 76 days ago, and feel proud of it. The initial motivation and energy that NoFap gave me seem to have vanished. Did it happen to anyone here ? Any tips ?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afpz6a/where_are_the_superpowers/

Good things await him who picks the good;

by choosing the gratifying, one misses one's goal.

Both the good and the gratifying present themselves to a man;

The wise assess them, note their difference;

I’m coming off of a 42 day nofap streak, and my current objective is 90 days. But I’ve had a couple other 15 day streaks before this. 

Whenever I abstain from MO, my balls start to smell like semen, you know...that ammonia kind of smell, and I’ve come to the conclusion that it really starts to kick in by day 6 or day 7, after all, that is when  testosterone peaks.  Also it’s not because of not cleaning, I clean it every time I’m in the shower and it comes right back afterward.  

I have no medical conditions of any sort, and this only happens when I go on semen retention, but does this happen to you guys? I’m just curious to know, cause I feel like what I’m smelling is actually old semen, but idk

15679,Question to NoFap,How do I ask someone out?,"First of all, please ignore how pathetic the title makes me sound. Originally I was going to ask this question elsewhere, but I decided to pose this question to the community that helped me get to this point in the first place. Despite what my user flair suggests, I've made a lot of progress since I began this journey back in August. I feel ready to take the next step in my recovery, but I need help.

&amp;#x200B;

First allow me to provide some background. I'm a 20-year-old male. I've suffered from pornography addiction since I was 13 years old. It eventually got so bad that I became paranoid, socially awkward, and admittedly downright creepy at times. I was an outcast during high school. Sure I had a few friends, but I spent most of my time alone feeding my addiction. As would be expected I never had a girlfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I became severely depressed. I gained weight. I was even suicidal for a while. I dropped out of college after one year. I couldn't keep my grades up or make any friends. Both were a result of my addiction. I was ready to give up on life.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I decided to change instead. I've become a very different person over the past year. I lost weight. I got on medication for major depressive disorder. I got a job to support myself for the time being. I discovered this community and began fighting my addiction. For the first time I can remember I feel happy, confident, and optimistic.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I feel ready to take the next step in turning my life around. I've met a girl I have a lot in common with. I don't know her very well, but I know I like her. I want to ask her out, but there's one problem. I don't know how. Any advice is appreciated (even if it's to man-up and just ask her). When should I do it? What should I say? Where should I offer to take her?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance NoFap. It's because of this community that I'm willing to take this risk in the first place.

Things wrong with me, Frederick Pol  Alexander Halsey-Dam:
A 1 beside the issue means that I can solve it by the end of the night or I can do something about it tonight

A 2 beside an issue means it is something I can practice for a week and see positive change at least a month from now

A 3 means I can solve the issue simply by practicing a skill

A 4 means I will try to work on solving it this week 

This week I will:
- Practice music more 
- I will play bass for at least twenty minutes a day and learn at least two songs by ear by Sunday
- I will practice sight reading for ten minutes a day at least
- I will play guitar at least ten minutes a day and learn one song by ear by Sunday
- I will strongly prefer producing over video games and have one beat completed by Sunday
- This is all something I can achieve
- I’m doing this because music is my passion and will be my career whether that’s for me or not

- Talk to girls I like more (let’s just go with Brooklyn, Grace, Rachel and Sam to start off. If I see an opportunity I should take it. The conversation doesn’t need to be successful)
- I will have at least one at least slightly exciting conversation with Rachel
- I will ask Grace what school she goes to and make at least one mildly creative joke
- I will have at least two good conversations with Brooklyn and at least one that is Nolanless
- I will speak to Sam at least three times and awkwardly compliment at least once

- I will bring JBPs book to class and read it
- I can’t say much more than I will read it

15816,Success Story,"My Nofap journey &amp; increase of masculine knowledge, reboot, and self connection","Hey guys, I’m very new to Reddit and just wanted to give anyone new to this (and old) some motivation from my own experience of NOFAP as a young Male. I started right before my 20th birthday. Nofap really is like rocket fuel for your life when you use it correctly! 

Just for some background I am a 20 year old Male, of British Asian descent. I am about 5’9, 135 pounds. I will talk about various things from my general outlook on life, feelings, girls (every guy loves success stories with girls on Nofap) my energy levels, and goals all in relation to Nofap since I started. So for some background, 

I have never suffered from social anxiety or anything like that, or any confidence issues. I was always fairly loud and social growing up in school, however I never had the killer ‘ultra instinct’ confidence that I saw certain guys that I looked up to have, while I was younger. 

HOWEVER  I did frequently use porn &amp; did fap very frequently, at least 4 times a day since 13 all the way through till I found Nofap about a month/two months before my 20th birthday . I also started smoking weed when I was 16, and progressed from about smoking weed 2x a week to full blown smoking weed everyday by the time I was 19. So I was smoking weed all the time &amp; fapping all the time.

Now, I didn’t necessarily feel ‘bad’, however what I did do was numb down my dopamine receptors unwittingly by constantly bashing through my mid-teens, not realising the damage I was doing in the long run to my brain neurologically &amp; psychologically. I would smoke joints with my friends, come home &amp; bash 3-4 times. It never occurred to me to stop because I thought it was completely normal Male behaviour. I was in a bubble, completely unaware of how it was potentially affecting me in all areas of my life &amp; how stopping could massively benefit me (which it has) so I’m gonna skip all the long blabbing because it’s been a very long &amp; good journey, however I want to leave the best bits here. 

So immediately when I found about Nofap, I read how people felt massive energy, testosterone boost, more female attraction, more confidence, etc, and I wanted in. Things were alright but I want to be the best version of myself. So boom! I started my journey. As soon as I stopped jerking, my urge for weed completely stopped. Dead. No more, because it was a pleasure seeking activity with no work or reward, directly tied into bashing, so as one stopped, the other died.

Immediate effects:

Since I was smoking &amp; bashing for years, within 3 days Of stopping I felt immediate energy/mental clarity. I felt so sharp mentally &amp; my ideas were so much more coherent &amp; ordered than normal . Everything is now extremely vivid. I could feel emotions intensely &amp; powerfully. I felt extremely alive. 

I remember waking up &amp; shedding tears at how beautiful I felt. It felt like a veil had been lifted, and that I’m now really alive. I shed tears the first 3-4 mornings, 

When I was smoking constantly I was numb in all aspects mentally, I was disconnected . I think this was my dopamine receptors becoming sensitive again. I immediately started exercising, using my weights, going for runs in the morning before work, which catapulted the effect massively. I felt extremely energised &amp; confident. A few days later I went into work completely different to my pre no fap days. I was extremely confident &amp; energised. When speaking to girls I normally spoke to, suddenly the eye contact was so much more intense. Suddenly I was looking attractive girls in the eyes without giving no F****, suddenly I was making them laugh &amp; they were enjoying conversation so much more than normal &amp; suddenly I became so much more memorable to them. Even when there are two/three girls, they will all pay attention because I speak so clearly &amp; directly in a masculine manner compared to before.  This one chick literally let out a loud squeal when she was making eye contact with me &amp; I didn’t break at all until she walked out the shop. She couldn’t believe I held it all the way through. My natural confidence oozed, because I wanted to connect with a real girl now. Im so much more in touch with my emotions &amp; spirit than before. I feel like they could sense that, that I’m really alive now.
Older males would banter me &amp; they would also try to make me laugh &amp; everyone in general would be so much more social towards me, showing respect. Everything is much livelier now.

Go on two weeks, I started boxing at an amateur gym instead of smoking. The combination of Nofap, clean diet, much healthier sleeping pattern, not smoking weed, taking greater care of myself, &amp; intense boxing training x3 a week really is drastically improving me mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually.

When I walked into work on Nofap for the first time ever, my co-worker who goes gym intensely just approached me randomly and gave me a ‘Yeah’ with a head nod out of nowhere. I shit you not, he came up to me &amp; said ‘yeah’ with a nod of approval as soon as I stopped jerking the gherkin. A customer that normally comes in with his GF walked in, &amp; as soon as he walked in he looked at me &amp; screwed his face up. Like he was trying to figure something out! I shit you not. Like ‘what’s going on with this guy then?’ Type of look. Everyone was sub-consciously used to my constant fap energy, that when I stopped everyone was surprised. This good looking chick that is taller than me never spoke to me when I served her before, one week into Nofap (testosterone increase) &amp; me using weights, she suddenly speaks to me now &amp; acknowledging me, smiling, etc . That’s just a very small part.

The affects accumulated more &amp; more the deeper I went. Conversations with pretty girls became extremely easy, there was no second guessing. My eye contact is naturally dominant, &amp; my body language is cool, relaxed &amp; controlled. They naturally submitted since my masculine energies increased naturally. I felt the increase of energy/testosterone/spirit, Male essence whatever you want to call it dramatically. 

BTW This never happens when I used to bash a lot. I never would get eye contact or looks this intense/deeply as now. One woman who even mocked me before  Nofap days come into work the other day when I haven’t seen her for a month &amp; said now she ‘could tell’ that I don’t drink/smoke (gave these up with Nofap’ she literally noticed the increase in masculinity within me, and now she was quieter then before. My eye contact is now much more clear, in a natural way. I also noticed my face began to look more masculine, if you will.

Girls act more feminine, shy, there is more interaction,  eye contact and conversation than before. Although it’s completely normal now fo me, I don’t expect anything less since I’m 20 years old lol. 

I am much more direct in conversation. I won’t beat around the bush. My voice is also deeper. I’ve also noticed a increase in stamina, I have much more mental energy &amp; I am more stress resilient.  I used to feel nervousness before but now all I feel is a natural, God given masculinity/dominance radiating from within me, I also don’t care about anything which doesn’t directly concern me, which is good. I felt amazing. I relapsed on week 3 of my first streak when this girl from Tinder added me on snapchat &amp; sent me a nude with a lot of dirty talk. I’d never received explicit photos before in my life before pre Nofap. Next steak I ended up getting numbers &amp; video chatting two very good looking white chicks from tinder &amp; badoo ( this never ever happened before Nofap either)

My manager at work all now treat me with much more respect now as opposed to before. My performance at work has sky rocketed, and I can work longer hours without fatiguing. My store manager frequently calls me ‘big Man’ &amp; my other manager now is really cool with me. Baring in mind they’re about 15-20 years older &amp; fairly larger than me physically, although I don’t expect any less. Now the effects have ‘stabilised’ 

As men, we aren’t designed to jack off constantly, believe it or not. Our sexual life force is almost divine.  It takes intense energy to create sperm, it is designed for women only. The way my life flipped turned upside down from nofap is astounding.

15827,Advice to NoFap,If NoFap makes you emotional...,"We've all become addicted to fapping. The thing with addiction is, is that it controls how your body uses dopamine. So when you quit Fapping. Your body goes ""What the fuck is going on, where is our dopamine rush?"". Until it forces itself to reset to the 'normal' way. We've used fapping as an escape from reality. Don't deny it, most of us are probably lonely as fuck. And we fap because that's the only way we can fill the void that is inside us, feelings of loneliness, disconnection, all of that. So when you stop fapping, you are going to become way more sensitive, you're going to be grumpy, annoyed, aggressive, lonely, sad...it makes sense why, it's because you've escaped from these things by fapping, by pretending like you and this pornstar are in love, or imagining like the scene is happening to you IRL. But you have to push through that time, and when your body resets you will feel like a different person, and biologically, you will be.

15850,Journal Check-In,Placebo or not?,"I was introduced to NoFap accidentally about a week ago. I never realized that I had that habit which occurs to be unhealthy cause I ""was"" a moderate faper imo. So I've done a small research and in a matter of a couple of hours I decided to give NoFap a try while I thought that in my case it won't be so hard to do so. And a week in, I barely think about PMO even though as far as I remember, I never had such a streak and a chance to experience the benefits of NoFap.My point is that the last two days I feel like a different person which concerns my understanding-perception, my reactions and my decisions. My creativity and the urge to achieve things have exploded.I'm noticeably more sharp and productive, quite more social and some of my deepest memories are coming on the surface! Many other benefits are noticeable as well but I'm trying to keep it together, while I can allow it to be a big successful placebo effect.

BUT. Just an hour ago I was doing a typing speed test as I do occasionally for fun every now and then. While trying to surpass my personal best 65 WPM with 100% accuracy for quite long now, I sat today after 5 days and done a 70 WPM with 100% accuracy with the first go. My concentration was much better and my fingers were playing the piano on that damn keyboard, while my mind was flying somewhere else. I was shocked when I saw the counter before the end of the minute and actually wasted few seconds, but still, there was no way I could do more than 65WPM for ages and that tells me something :)

15942,Telling my Story,My experiences from a little over a month in this community,"Hi all, I know these kind of posts are extremely rampant in this subreddit but I need to share my experiences. I'll give a rundown of my life during the effects of PMO, and why the NoFap community means so much to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was introduced to Porn at the young age of 9, discovered masturbation not too long afterwards, and have been an addict for a solid 10 years since then. I used to be an extremely outgoing kid, I loved hanging out with friends, talking to new people, and was just full of life in general. Throughout my 5th grade and middle school years I slowly became more and more introverted, no longer going out of my way to talk to new people. This was combined with a very hostile class of peers and it pushed me into only spending time with my closest of friends, and I slowly gained weight from stress eating and became fairly hefty.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved right before High School to a much more welcoming community. I took the move as an opportunity to become someone else and joined Marching Band and another school sport. I got into shape quickly and had much more energy than I had had since I was introduced to PMO. 

As much as I enjoyed my time with these groups, I wasted so many social opportunities. I found a few guys that quickly became like brothers to me and I talked to few people outside this group. My marching band experience consisted of over 100 amazing individuals that I didn't talk or try to hang out with. Even in the other school sport it took me to almost the end of my senior year to begin making some friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated and started taking classes at a nearby college, however I still lived at home. As the weeks passed, I hadn't made any new friends and was getting depressed slowly. The only thing I looked forward to in my day was a club sport that I had joined. I did well my first semester but it was at the cost of my sleep, social life, and mental health. The only thing that kept me going through it was PMO (I know, BIG no-no), I'd come home and waste my time with it. I obviously failed NNN, and it just made me feel worse. I kept up this addiction because I've never been in a romantic relationship, and have wussed out of every opportunity that I've had; despite how much I want to have a girlfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Redemption Time***

Early December when looking up NSFW forums, I saw the subreddit r/NoFap . Out of curiosity I opened it up and read the first post I saw, which was about someone who had been clean for two weeks and that was the longest he had been clean for over 5 years. I looked at myself then and there and saw what I was doing, a struggling kid with a PMO addiction who hadn't been clean for more than a few days in NEARLY A DECADE. This addiction has skewed my definition of a relationship, coerced me to believe that PMO was the way to cope with everything, and it put me in the passenger seat in the car of my life. I didn't get to decide what I wanted to do, my addiction did. I did some quick math and realized that almost everything that I thought was wrong with my life was caused by this. I had wasted so many opportunities during my PMO days.

I started my first timer then and there, and since that moment have only relapsed 3 times. 3 more than I would have liked, but slow progress is progress nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

Since starting my journey I've noticed a few things.

1. More energy, motivation, and clarity when doing things.

2. Easier to talk to people, and I've become more extroverted much like when I was a kid.

3. Despite depression looming over, I wake up feeling happier much more ready to go than I had before.

 

I feel excited about my future. Even though I'm flatlining right now, I can honestly say that I actually believe that things will get better for me. And I'm back in the drivers seat in my life's car.

r/NoFap  I want to thank you, from the absolute bottom of my heart. THANK YOU. This community gave me my life back.

16097,Success Story,Wow today was hard,"I’m not gonna lie, I was close to breaking. Not only did I have urges that were my strongest in months, but they lasted hours. Probably 7 consecutive hours from early afternoon to late evening. Wow. 

But I didn’t masturbate. I didn’t look at porn. I didn’t even indulge in literotica or Insta stuff. I had to punch a couple pillows, I had to vent on r/nofapchristians, but I’m still here. I’m doing this.

Memories of past failures kept me going. After one of my relapses, I distinctly thought “wow, after so much time, the O wasn’t even that good”. After another, I was navigating reddit to reset my counter AS I was finishing. My head cleared that fast. So this time, I told my lizard brain that somehow what I was doing by abstaining made sense, I just couldn’t see it at the moment.

And I made it. I’ve been back to “normal” for a few hours now. I even got a match on a dating app (not tinder) just a few hours after I most seriously considered giving in. Will it amount to anything? Probably not. And even if it doesn’t, it’s a reminder that if you hang on just a little while longer, relief can come. A reminder of why you’re fighting your baser instinct. And maybe, in some way, a reward for all your effort. 

I’m going to bed now, and I’ll wake up hitting day 10. Today was just a single battle in a very long war. But I won. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afssfm/wow_today_was_hard/

16270,Relapse Report,Find it hard to get a streak again after one relapse,"So, since December 23rd last year, I had done no PMO. Now, two Saturdays ago, I slipped and relapsed. This happened because of a shitty day at work, some people were particularly frustrating that day and I left overall feeling really down. I was at a 17 day streak then, and that was my first attempt at no PMO. I was proud of myself reflecting back on it. Since, I have failed to maintain a streak multiple times. As of today I have still not looked at P, I've only failed at MO. But I know that to reboot, 90 days of no PMO is recommended for the average person.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time around my goal was 90 days, but I only made it to 17. Then last week I figured I should just find a goal that is achievable. In this case, seeing as I made it to 17, I thought two weeks (14 days) was a good achievable goal. However, after 5 days I failed again.

&amp;#x200B;

What has helped me so far is cold showers (I started showering with cold water at the same time as NoFap), and it has made it easier. Whenever there's an urge to do PMO, I take a cold shower. Really helps. A cold shower right after losing your streak also helps. I don't know about other people but for me, my nerves are extra sensitive right after O, and so that is kind of a way to punish yourself I suppose. Maybe that's wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways besides these things, I still feel like I'm slowly falling back into the old habit. Like I said, so far I've been able to stay off the P but for the full reboot I'll need to quit MO as well. I go to university and work on the weekends (either Saturday or Saturday and Sunday). Right now I have a lot of time off with only a few hours of uni every week, and besides University and work I just sit at home.

I was thinking about this the other day. I feel awesome and like a completely new person ever since I started participating in NoFap. But the one thing that came across my mind was that exact question. What if I had not wasted my social life for some stupid and unnecessary addiction.?

For me personally, I could have had loads of more social contacts and interests. I could’ve (and probably would’ve) had a sweet and loving girlfriend by now. I could’ve been so much more mature than I was before NoFap. It’s crazy to think that I went from someone who doesn’t care about life to someone who appreciates the small things in life in just 90 days. I regret being addicted to PMO so muchin the past, but I can’t change anything about my history, I can only influence my future, and that alone is what keeps me going on NoFap.

16286,Motivation,Working with homeless people opened my eyes. We are not much different,"For more than a year I work with homeless people. It's a day care center, where they can shower, get a haircut, get new clothes (for free), and we change wound dressing. 

So I get to meet these guys and gals, some are fairly regular, some or not. Some want to cheat with our day care system to get more clothing or take longer showers (15min. is limit). But those I want to talk to you about are the regulars, they are the ones who open up usually. When we earn their trust they admit to quite a few thing. I never ask them what led them to become homeless, but they like to talk about their family - it's the highest value they have. They revisit their past wishing to change. They had dreams, they had plans, but something got in the way. Mostly addiction or bad partner.

What I noticed, they get satisfied with short term pleasures. Except few who are fighters and are strugling to get better. They pity themselves not aware THEY are the sole cause of their problems. Their uncontrollable adiction and each decision when they gave in to it.

We are so similar - us and them. We pity ourselves, make excuses why things don't work out, we tell ourselves ""this is the last time"" and ""I will start tomorrow"" or ""i have it under control"". Each of these decisions led them and us to the places we are today.

16306,Emergency - Help!,But why ?,"           Let me put this up straight , I have been addicted to PMO since 13 (now 20) , I had a very bad childhood so there was no other way or option to accuire pleasure or to be joyful , I slipped into it unknowingly . 
            It is a very destructive habit which I always hated , my addiction went so immense and  unfortunately I found FEMDOM genre of porn before a year  but I found it to be so much pleasurable amidst all other .
           Only  after watching a YouTube video I was redirected to nofap community  it's been 2 months since I started abstaining porn , my longest was 13 days.  
           On the days when  I don't PMO my heartbeat rises so vigorously , I don't know why , it is so unbearable and I feel so uncomfortable when this happens , these heavy rise in heart beats only stops when I watch porn . 
           I don't know wheather I have an anxiety problem or something . So I kindly request you to give some points regarding what is happening to me . ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afv4vu/but_why/

I've created a new profile to keep track of my progress, as my SO knows the username of my main account. NoFap helped me turn my life around.

16408,Telling my Story,Thinking about relapsing? DON'T.,"I was on a 17 day streak until today, which is my longest so far(second longest was 16 days). I don't even remember what happened, but I found myself on two different porn sites at once, furiously opening and closing different videos to find the one I liked. I kept telling myself that it's fine, it won't have any effect on me, I'll just masturbate a couple of times a week from now on, it'll keep me from the struggle.

Then I relapsed. The high lasted for literally two seconds before that moment of clarity came crashing down upon me. My brain started feeling the foggiest it had ever felt (which probably used to be my constant state of mind before NoFap) and I just wanted to scream. My 17 days' worth of struggle was over in an instant, and for what? A few seconds of an artificial high? Fuck that.

Even then I kept telling myself it won't have any effect on me, but guess what? I waited for half an hour before starting to study again (I had been on a break during the relapse) and I couldn't understand or focus on a single thing - even a simple introductory paragraph! Frustrated, I snapped my book shut and started a movie, wasting half a day of my exam prep (I don't have a lot of time left).

After relapsing, I had been thinking about going light for a few days before starting NoFap again, but after what I just experienced, I've decided to just steel myself and go all out. Fuck me if I PMO again.",165,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afwk28/thinking_about_relapsing_dont/

I found now that if I have an itch to watch garbage, I quickly become conscious of my thoughts and realize that I am not a person that watches others fuck, like am I crazy.

My mindset has been switched and I tell myself that I'm not trying to quit PMO, I simply just don't do it. I also don't think about porn as something good/pleasurable, I think about it as something disgusting/filthy/garbage. I also compare pain and suffering to PMO.

When having this mindset, I found that my body actually tries to avoid PMO, which makes it considerably more easy. When I unexpectedly have an urge, I use it to energize myself.

It does help to mention that you are not your thoughts, you are the observer of your thoughts. I don't act on porn thoughts, I simply let the thought fly by..",41,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afwo1n/im_on_day_7_and_heres_why_im_having_success/

16500,New to NoFap,A new beginning...,"Tomorrow is day one. I’ve never tried this before, porn is causing problems in my relationships as well as motivating issues. No more porn, no more fap. I even downloaded a “sober” app to mutually keep track of my progress. Here we go...",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afxsvj/a_new_beginning/
16501,Motivation,Realizing this motivated me so much more,"Porn has completely destroyed my life, to give you a brief summary of how fucked up my life is right now because of it: I'm 24 with no job, living off of my girlfriends income who still stays with her mom who doesn't even know I moved in. I piss in plastic bottles to avoid having to go to the bathroom where she could potentially hear me and I get busted while my gf is at work. And lay in bed binge watching and edging to p for hours until my gf gets off work where we then eat and smoke pot, and this is day after day for months now. My knees constantly ache from my laptop being propped on them for hours while I basically brainwash myself with the most depraved fetishes I can find. I am severely depressed, have 0 motivation, 0 confidence, 0 self esteem, severe anxiety, and see no hope for my future, and so much more that I don't even have to get into rn. 

Fed up with my life and coming to the realization that porn has destroyed me I decided to google about quitting and found nofap. After struggling with it and only being able to go 2 days I finally snapped and forced myself to stick it out a week or more, and that's the first time I felt nofap benefits. on the 6th and 7th day I felt a little dose of confidence and motivation to work on self improvement which i haven't felt in years. I then relapsed and lost it all and it made me feel like I'm so messed up at this point there is no hope for people like me and desperately wanted something else to be the reason for my failures. (Maybe if my girlfriend was more like those pornstars I wouldn't have to fap) but after being teased with those benefits I had no choice but to blame pmo for my downfall. 

Something I realized recently that motivates me to continue on this journey was realizing that BECAUSE I am so messed up and so low I will notice and appreciate the benefits more because of it. Like being desperate for water in a dessert and finally getting water vs having water at your disposal and not getting the same satisfaction from a taking a sip. Since I am at such a low point in my life I will be able to experience more things getting better then if I was already well off striving for the best. Start nofap and collect those benefits, use those benefits to start working out, combine those benefits to securing a good job and those benefits to focus on my diet and eat healthier, and feel more secure in my relationship instead of constantly thinking she will dump me for being such a slob and hopefully move out into our own place. I made this post to get these things off my chess and also in hopes that it will motivate others who may think they are too deep into their addiction to quit and regain their life back, and hopefully that motivation comes full circle. The more messed up you are the more you will appreciate the recovery! nofap Day 1 lets gooo!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afxtd0/realizing_this_motivated_me_so_much_more/
16510,Question to NoFap,Day 39. Feeling low.,"Is this common? Could it be because I am rewiring? I have heard of it being the case when the brain isnt getting the usual dopamine rush associated with PMO. I havnt glanced and porn since I started this (never ending) streak. Last night I almost relapsed but I didn't and so maybe that has me so down?

 Wondering if you guys have any advice. I go to the gym as often as I can, exams make it hard these days, though I should be back to my regular workout routine come february. I am eating well too. 

Another thing I noticed soon after my streak began (around day 10) was that I was a lot more attracted to my girlfriend. Now at almost day 40 I find myself a lot more attracted to other women. Potentially me brain is trying to associate the addiction to porn women to women in the real world. This new attraction is purely physical and feels a lot like my brain may be trying to get the same feeling of porn from real people. 

Any feedback/support you guys have could you please let me know! :) ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afxx7s/day_39_feeling_low/

I'm only on day 3, however after having sex I had the strong urge to keep continuing with my orgasms. This is the addictive nature of getting that dopamine hit, I can't do without just one orgasm, I need more and more in succession or later throughout the day. As a result of this I've found the urges much more intense today than the previous 2 days of my NoFap journey. 

With all that being said, I have only masturbated once today, and that was at her place without the use of any porn at all. Which means I am still doing better than what I was doing prior to NoFap.

16539,Success Story,My no fap journey,"My story began 10 years ago when I was 9 years old. I was browsing my uncles computer when somehow managed to get to my uncles history folder. There was a link titled “young boy gets hardcore fucked by big burly man” , not knowing what it was I clicked the link and was mesmerized by what was on my screen. (To preface this I was an early bloomer and got hair down there very young) my penis was starting to get hard and I was getting super flustered. Then the unthinkable happened, my uncle and parents walked it, I flipped out and threw my uncles computer across the room.  My parents not knowing what I was doing got mad at me, not for watching the forbidden but for breaking my uncles computer. Tho my uncle seemed very pleased by this outcome because he knew what dark secrets where on his computer and he knew his consciences. But this was only the beginning. This feeling kept with me for years until I finally got a laptop for myself. I was now twelve years old and i really was starting to understand my body; I was using the internet one day and I remembered my previous experience and did the unthinkable I masturbated. This started a downward spiral of masturbating 3 to 4 times a day. My penis became extremely raw and I couldn’t walk around without feeling an intense pain. Because of this I could never go and mingle with people in my small town. I am homeschooled so I never had people come to my house either.  Eventually my parents found out it was my senior year and I was in the peak of my depression, I would masturbate at this point 5 to 6 times a day. Porn at 100% consumed me. I would go the the bathroom and bust a nut so often my mom started to ask if I was okay. Then one day the secret was out, I was in my room and my parents got a key and unlocked my room from the outside and saw me.  They had a long talk with me and we came to a conclusion  that I would not fap for 3 years. I am one year through my journey and I’m feeling great, I started to talk to people again. It’s been so long I’ve had to re-learn so many thinks but I’m learning so many things.

16561,Motivate Me,Relapse on and off NoFap,"Hey guys, I just wanna get this out my chest. I've been doing the NoFap journey on/off since like 2014, at least afaik. But, the reality is that I've been fine. I have a girlfriend and all, I will be almost two years with on February 3. 

What I wanna talk to you about is my experience on this journey. I sincerly believe that PMO, or what it entails, it's a reality, and it's an addiction (or at least a habit that is WAY difficult to shake it off). A few things I want to mention are as follows:

1. There's is defenitely (at least from my experience) a benefit from PMO abstention. I can have better sex if I don't PMO. The erection is stronger!
2. The porn addiction is a reality. Whatever the media consumes, and makes companies thrive for money, that's what gives them profit, no matter the costs or consequences (us being addicted to this shit).
3. The real powers come from within us. We must be our change that we want to see in ourselves. Yes, abstaining from PMO definitely will improve our lives and we have much more time.

Countless users have mentioned those benefits before, but what I really want to share is the addiction cycle which I've been:

1. What the fuck is wrong with me, I sincerely prefer watching porn than having sex with my girlfriend. I think that that is really fucked up and I wanna change that.
2. I feel like if I objectify her, that is really fucked up.
3. I feel the need of watching through a mirror when I'm having sex with her. That is completely nonsense.
4. Finally, I want to point out that I've been lying to myself jacking off only on sundays, and then we have sex on friday and/or saturdays. But the truth is that it's been really hard for me. That's been going on and on.
5. I haven't tell her anything about my PMO addiction, but I really want to quit.

Yesterday, I relapsed and PMOed like three times. I know it's harmful for me, but how can I stop this? I really want to get past a month (it's been almost a year since I haven't reached that time).

16609,New to NoFap,I am sick of myself.,"I have a problem. Everytime I try to commit myself to stop fapping I may be successful for a short while but I end up relapsing. I have a girlfriend but she is not always around. When she is, I usually don't fap nor even watch porn. When she isn't around, I just feel that craving to watch porn and fap. I have been going through a continuous cycle of this. Every time I look in the mirror I just feel disgusted by what I have become. I can't even share this with anyone because of all the judgment I will receive. And on top of all this, every time I am do it, I feel so insecure about myself because of my penis size. This just makes me feel sick of who I am. 

A while back when I wasn't in reddit, I heard about a community where I people going through this could join and I never thought much about. Back then this wasn't a big issue for me, now it is.

My current goal is to gain some self confidence and also improve my body since I am overweight. I really hope that this is the best community to help me stop this continuous cycle of self hate",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/afzbfb/i_am_sick_of_myself/

I started my journey with [r/NoFap](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap). I am forever grateful to my addiction and would not be here at this point without encouragement from my wife and my friends. Let me also say that there is no magic here. Just do it. I have been married 11 years now and 4 years ago it was on the verge of collapse. I am happier then I have ever been without PMO and it’s just better. I found purpose and that you cannot do this alone. It’s just not possible. This addiction thrives in the dark and if you don't live in the light then you will fall. Also you must filter all you see and be held accountable. Garbage in equals Garbage out (PMO). My advice for anyone wanting more, is to delay all of your gratification, get in a group, learn about your feelings, and learn why you do it and then most of all focus on staying sober one day at a time.

Today was overall a good day when it comes to productivity, I'm on day 11 which is my second highest streak so far (29 days my best). 

Everything was fine, not a single edge and peak until today, when I saw something on the internet that just flipped the switch. It all began with ""just a small peak"". It seemed like just a few minutes but at some point I have snapped out of it... After 1,5 hour marathon of porn and edging I just finally realised what I was doing and just stopped, closed the browser and went back to my daily plan. I'm still shocked that I haven't relapsed after that, but it makes me super happy, nofap gods sure blessed me today and gave me a chance to continue my streak.

Effortless 10 days let my guard down and it really shows that there is no weaker enemy than the one that is certain of his victory, the addiction just creeps in there, waiting, and attacks you with full force when you think you already won. I'm making this post is form of diary so it can remind me (and everyone else who is reading this post) that no matter how easy it is, everything can go downhill in matter of seconds. 

I remember that on my longest streak I had similar experience also around day 10 and afterwards it was going smooth (stupid me relapsed on day 29 just because he didn't saw any benefits - until losing them after relapsing few times, of course) so it makes me hopeful that this streak will be my last one, lifetime long.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, guys! This is my first post on reddit so please bear with me if i do something dumb. Also english is not my mother tongue so.. you have been warned.

Anyway, if you have the time, lean back and read my story/tips/wall\_of\_text.

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, **my story**.

&amp;#x200B;

At this moment, i go through some tough moments (not dark, just tough). I have fallen again in the circle. So i'll break it writing my first reddit post + telling my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps you want to know a little bit about me. Well, my first *experience* was on facebook. I was around 10 years old and bored. Browsing the profiles i got to some spanish girls (models?) (no hablo espanol  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ). Anyway, i would hump my bed till the *magic* would happen.

It felt.. weird. So i decided to delete my fb profile. But as a rushed-confused-horny boy that i was, i simply deactivated the profile. A few years later i had a project at school. So i needed fb again. Hey, i'm back. So.. i started exploring. Guess who decided to make an instagram account as well. And a reddit one. You can imagine the *funny* things i was able to find.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now i use facebook only for messenger, and i didn't touch instagram since last summer (my account still exists but i don't care about it/remember it's password *so eh*). Also i have deleted my reddit account. It's just that on reddit i would spend most of my time. Not only on *those* subreddits, but i would browse memes and nerdy stuff    

( r/MechanicalKeyboards*, i'm looking at you*).

I made this reddit account just for this post. I don't think that I'll touch it again. Maybe I'll delete it, maybe I'll just let it be.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's talk about **nofap**. I discovered nofap when i was \~15, really tried it at \~16.

I used to beat my peepee once per week. Then it felt so good that i did it once in a few days. Then daily. And multiple times per day.  *sigh*

For a while i thought ""it feels so good, and people seem to say it's ok. i shouldn't worry"". But feeling so good for doing rather nothing was for me, well, ""too good to be true"". So i decided to try nofap.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's talk about the thing that people care (**too much**) about: **THE STREAKS**

&amp;#x200B;

I remember many failed streaks. *Jesus, that's lot of failed streaks*. All until i got pissed off. I would enter on r/nofap   
religiously. I had the [emergency button](https://emergency.nofap.com/) as a bookmark. My only subscriptions were on r/nofap, r/wholesomememes and r/meditation. I uninstalled steam and all my games. Heck, i made a new mail account just to forget about those things. From gaming stuff, my youtube history was now filled with ""dress with style"", ""best shoulders workout"", ""how to approach girls"", and many (and i mean *MANY*) motivational videos. I started meditating (i used calm (link below)). I started reading self-help books. Duolingo helped me to practice my german (*guten tag*).

&amp;#x200B;

And then. The moment that everybody is going nuts about: **I reached a 90 days streak**. Hooray.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW I BET you want to know about MY NEW SUPERPOWERS. HOW I STARTED LEVITATING. Just a few inches from the ground smh. lol. On a serious note, **nofap does NOT really do so much by itself**. I mean, my face was clearer. I also felt above the average person because i didn't touch my thingie (*not a good mentality*). But these are the only things i felt for simply abstaining. I know about testosterone, and energy and things. My *humble* guess is that by actually taking care of my nutrition and working out rather than eating *anything* from the fridge and browsing non-stop youtube/reddit, that's how my mood-energy got higher (not *superman* high, but *ok-ish/happy* with life high).

But i have never been a fan of chemistry/biology, so i'm sorry to dissapoint you with my lack of explanations. There are many other great posts you can read tho. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now, let me tell you **how nofap evolved for me**

As you saw earlier, i had a ""special"" time before my 90 days streak, with all those activities. Well things have changed for me. Trying to do all of that *was trying to become too perfect*. My realtionships got colder with the few friends that i have (not bad guys, just hardcore gamers); my clothes were suddenly bad; i found many things wrong with me.

&amp;#x200B;

You eventually learn how to calibrate. At that time, I was trying too much to be too much. I used to go crazy *just for hearing* ""steam"", ""cs"" etc. Now i can even play a little if i visit someone (i still don't have any game on my pc). I used to wear *only* shirts and boots. Now i'm fine with a plain t-shirt and some sneakers. You see, it's not a straight line. There are ups and downs and ups and downs and flatlines. But they pass nontheless. Just like hitting the gym (*i love comparing life with working out*), there are normal days, deload days and new max days.

&amp;#x200B;

And now, **a few tips**, for the brave ones that read my story ^((and the lazy ones, aswell)):

* **give up on thinking about nofap**. Yes, *i said that*. You see, coming back on this subreddit reminds you why you are here (keeping a streak does the same). It reminds you of your crutches that helped you deal with your life. P and M are tools that you use to deal with boredom/depression/other\_bad\_things. For me, good days are days when i don't even think about nofap. Yes, it is hard. Especially if you are new. But when you feel like you're losing it, do something else so you can conecentrate on that activity and take control of yourself (*scream in a pillow if you are out of ideas*). Going outside helps. Or...
* **take cold showers**. You hate them or you love them. I passed through some stages from ""this is great"" to ""why do i keep on doing this?"" to ""i can't do this anymore"" to ""WOOOOOO"" again. You kinda get used with them. *Kinda*;
* **move your body**. Lift things, do push-ups/squats, dance, run; heck, try stretching;
* **learn a new language**. Or at least a new alphabet. It's funny making ""encrypted"" notes;
* **write a journal**. At the end of the day you can cry your heart out and write whatever you feel like writing. Now your thoughts and memories are real and the journal keeps them. Just let them be there. Your brain doesn't have to think again and again about them and you can continue (or at least try to) sleep.  

(*BONUS* tip for the tip: if you are too scared that somebody will find the journal, write it on your pc; If you can hide *that* folder, then you can hide a text document between some other files) 

* **remember to have a moment of gratitude**. Write for whatever you are grateful. Or at least think about it. No idea? If you are reading my post, then you use some kind of electronic device. That's a thing. Or, at least, you know about nofap. That will do as well;
* **read books**. They make you undumb;
* **be 1% better every day**. Work you ass in the gym. Work your a-little-bit-messed-up brain on a project. Learn. Talk to the cute girl in line while you're waiting. *You know what i mean*. Do that thing that you keep delaying. Do that thing that you are too afraid to do, that you keep trying to do in the perfect moment. *That moment won't come*. (another *BONUS* tip for the tip: Count 5-4-3-2-1 and then act (the 5 second rule));
* **meditate** (5-10 minutes/day will do). or try some breathing tehniques (link below);
* **get rid of social media**. Or at least get to a point where you barley use it (read again my story if you don't trust this point);
* **get rid of news from mass media**. Yes, people are dying and politicians are doing something stupid. Nothing new here. Some specialized sites will probably give you a better information than your tv anyway. (no link here; everybody has their own passions);
* and please, for the love of Arnold, **do it for yourself**. Make it so you love what you are doing. Don't expect that a girl or a few more bucks will certainly make you happy. There are people that have those things you are chasing and they are not happy. You see, the whole happiness-in-life-thingie is a lil' bit more complex. Be sure that you love the process and what you are doing and don't think that something or somebody is the key to your happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

On a last note, **THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH! &lt;3**

It's been a long ride, and it is far from the end. But i'm grateful that i know about you guys. That i know we are together, brothers and sisters. I'm grateful for your stories, motivational memes and simple presence; for fighting against what you feel that holds you back.

We are all fapstronauts here, fighting to make better us, and in the end a better world.

I had some 2 day streaks after the daily relapses and my most recent streak was 3 days and 1 hour. Weak, but it was a factor in resisting the urge today. Here is what happened. Current streak is 2 days, but the urge was strong earlier and I was on the prowl. After about 2 hours I decided to get up and piss real quick, planning to resume my viewing immediately. But you can't piss with a stiffy, so, perhaps consequently, in a burst of motivation, afterward I came here instead.

I have way more energy throughout the day, I am finding myself really getting into and focused on my work and nothing else. And it makes the day fly by so fast. I feel on top of the world. All from just not playing with my wanker lol

16955,Question to NoFap,How do you see your brain rewiring progress?,"Seriously, the community's focus on ""why porn is harmful"" has to got to stop!

I have consumed so much of YouTube videos on NoFap that I am sure nobody in the community knows exactly HOW TO DO it. Or if they do, they don't share it.

So here's my question: 

How do you SEE your own progress with NoFap and how to the effects of rewiring your brain? 

For example, on a weight loss journey, we have before and after pictures where we can clearly see the changes in the body. HOW CAN WE DO THAT with NoFap? 

I think that this line of thinking will help me (and hopefully others) MOVE FORWARD without having to look backward or dissing on porn.

     Success doesn't come from winning. Success doesn't come from competition. It comes from rising, falling and *adapting* over and over. And if your ego is too big to accept that you WILL eventually fuck up bad in some area of life the say
 goodbye to hapinness. 


      Be cause the world is dying. And you and YOUR thoughts should be the only thing that matters. All these people that might as well be real - life botnets, who folloe the same train of thought, inspiration for action, and tenacity for the mundane as all these political and social figures will NEVER be the people that help you rise to the top.

If your ever feeling like the pain is so close, but the life is so far away, just think again about what the world teally is. 

Famine, war, pain, ignorance, injustice, perversion and other evils.

All things that can be manifested in each one of us if we let it.

But if you want something like peace, that the world doesn't offer, you will have to stop **looking** for it, and create it for yourself. 

Because, the exigence that some of us have found to be the very essence of our lives inspires a greater need.

A need for power. A need for justice. A need for change.

All of these things come in response to a need, not a desire. You must create that need.

Let it take root deep inside you until that need for watever it is you seek blooms, and inspires action.

This ""bloom"" is like the soul becoming the speed at which life runs, instead of looking for other lost sheep to match the speed of.

Once you create  that need, and define your own speed, the desire won't matter, the pain won't matter, the pestilence won't matter, and nor will comfort.

Adapt. Consume. Propel. Create.

The world is here for YOU. 

So make it what YOU want!

The mind, spirit and body are also your  birth right, so take advantage of the vessel that was given to your from the worlds first reception of you.

Some may not have the priveledge of a vesssel that has some power still in store. 

Right and wrong are only concepts made by the world to blur your view of what you already know deep down is the right path. Feelings and emotion are just neccessary indicators of another change that needs to be made.

If you fear others instead of fearing what is inside yourself then you are a fool. We are all indivual, yet we coexist. Having to coexist does not me we must circum to the meanings that others set for themselves.

Breathe yourself in. Breathe out fire.

Visualize your own flesh in your hands, and the power it holds. The flesh is very powerful in deed. But it's power is for you. Take it in, hold it, breathe out.

Everything must define itself, existence is  so kind as to give us hands and feet to use, but does not show us how to use them.

17026,Motivation,Just Another NoFap Story,"Okay, so first of all I am a 17 year old guy who has been doing PMO since I was 10. recently I have had a bit of trouble finding a grasp on life and it has been due to breaking from NoFap. Here's my story:

&amp;#x200B;

In the October of '17, I had found out that I had an addiction to NoFap in the process of trying to better my life. I was looking at porn one day and had stumbled upon a video named something like ""how to stop masturbating."" I was a curious boy back then and didn't really like the fact that I was doing PMO all the time, but I didn't know that it was the reason my life was so terrible. I watched the video and it had given a brief explanation of how PMO effects your brain. This was information that I had never heard before and I wanted to know more about it. So I looked at other videos that explain the effects of PMO and how to quit it. I also remember being aggravated with the fact that I let myself get addicted to something and that I was ignorant to the fact that it was an addiction.  NoFap was advertised to me in one of the videos and I was amazed by all the positivity and all the success stories I had soon took the time to read. I wanted to be just like those successors. I wanted to have a healthy life.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a plan of how I was going to quit and worked hard at to execute the plan. Well, I didn't get too far. I was really consumed in the sexual matter that I was used to, and just could not break away from it. After a month I had only been able to get myself to last every other day without fapping. During school I wanted to kill myself and everyone else there because I was so miserable. I had a calendar and I would mark with symbols my progress throughout NoFap. After the first couple months I had gotten to the point where I would last 4 or 5 days to maybe even a week. I was getting impressed more and more everyday with my progress. I started adding all of these positive quote groups on Facebook and started trying to help people with their problems; like depression and anxiety. I wanted to do a sort of pay it forward kind of thing. I started to love the world for all it is and the beauty it contains. I stopped watching YouTube and playing video games all the time, and I got closer to nature by going for long walks. I started to feel a lot healthier. I even lasted a whole month at one point. I started to talk to more people; even girls which I had a fear of before I got engaged in NoFap.

&amp;#x200B;

I met a few girls that were by best friends at one point; a few of them still are. I had so much confidence that I felt like I could do anything in the world. The day right before school started was the last time that I had done PMO for a while. Within the first couple weeks of school, I had made a bunch of good friends at school, and the majority of them were girls. I even had a few girls that had crushes on me. Every day after school I had like 4 or 5 girls that I would have long and deep conversations with. At this moment in my life everything was positive and it was the most happiest that I had been in my whole life--I grew up in an abusive house and I was under extreme stress and often had no way to escape other than to do PMO--I loved everyone at this time and thought that there was nothing bad in the world. My confidence and self-esteem was so high that I thought that life was finally looking out for me. I kept up with my spiritual stuff to keep my morals high and to make myself keep striving improve as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up getting a girlfriend in the October of '18; one year from when I started NoFap. This was the first girlfriend that I had ever had, so I didn't really know how relationships worked. It just felt really good to have someone there that cares a lot about me, and that always wants to talk to me. I was experiencing a connection that I had never felt before, and it felt really good. The relationship lasted about a month before she started drifting away from me. I had started to get really panicky and started getting upset with life. I started feeling not as good as I had before because I was losing the one thing or person that was making me happy. She then broke up with me and I was quite confused about why, but I soon came to the realization that it was because it wasn't as strong of a relationship as she had liked.

&amp;#x200B;

I went through a sort of depression state for a while and struggled to find things that made me happy. Having people to talk to is really the only thing that makes me happy in a healthy way. A lot of the friends I did have were either too far away or don't really talk to me anymore. I made the terrible decision to pick up my video games, YouTube, and doing a lot of nothing again. A girl whom had got depressed whilst I was dating the other girl saw that I had broke up with her and started talking to me again. We had long phone calls where she would express her feelings for me and she said many times that she really wanted to date me. I wanted to recover more from my ex and be by myself for a little bit because I'm a person who doesn't really like relationships, but I get into them because I enjoy being cared for and always having someone there for me and I know myself that I am a good person and that I can help a mate out when they are going through a tough time; this is why I had dated my first girlfriend. Then I made the hard decision to date her, and within the first week of us being together I had realized that she is much better of a girlfriend for me than my ex was. She did live farther away, so she wasn't always there to comfort me when I was going through tragic or depressing moments.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been beaten down so much by my ex breaking up with me. The video games and YouTube didn't help any because it was sucking all the energy right out of me. I got to the point where I had relapsed and fell back into PMO; I was on day 70 or 80 of NoFap. This was at the end of November and I had been doing PMO roughly once a week until the 10th of January. Then something happened. I spent all my Christmas money ($200) on my video game and I ended up winning an item that was worth $1200. I then went to sell the item, but got hacked and the item was stolen. This has made me turn away from the video game and I am now not playing any video games or watching YouTube because I came to realize that those things were the reason I kept relapsing. I am really happy with my life again, and I hope that this will help another person on their journey in some shape or form.

&amp;#x200B;

Now ever since I realized these things I have been a lot happier and so I decided to make this post to try to motivate another person. Just remember never give up on NoFap; even if you surpass 90 days. I strongly recommend quitting video games and television and all that crap because it's just a waste of energy. Always stay positive even in the darkest of times. If you have trouble trying to find something to do try to either meditate, go outside if you can, hang out with a friend, find a hobby, make music, get involved in a community, or even write up your life story. Just try to do something that is healthy and that will keep your brain productive so you don't fall back into PMO or any other addiction that you may be into.

But next week I start the job. I plan on keeping my head down and being determined and focused. Totally focusing on my self and the job. Will go to the gym with the same tenacity.

I want to do this for myself. And not just her because I don’t know if she’ll be there when I get back.

It changed my life, my values, my persona, my outlook, and my future. It altered how I viewed myself and others as well as how others viewed me.

I started just like anyone else; struggling with a porn addiction. I became anxious, agitated, fatigued, and lost my confidence, compassion, and morals. 
 I could go on and on, but I don’t want this farewell to be about me. This farewell goes out to the community of those who showed me a new and proper way of living life and for that I’m forever grateful.

Set a goal for yourself. Who are you doing this for? Yourself? Someone else? Hopefully both. If you have no reason to be doing it other than it being a challenge, I can 99% guarantee you’ll fail.

Be like me and do it for a girl that you like. I made a deal with myself in my head that if I PMO or even just MO then it’s over with that girl. And now I subconsciously see that as the truth.

My main problem today was just that I was bored. Hopped on Instagram and a girl that I know posted a really provocative picture and since I was bored, my mind got to wandering. 

It was a probably 4 hour battle of on and off urges. I got through it though, because I had a goal and a reason to do it.

17330,New to NoFap,I placed 4 Adult-content blockers on my phone.....,"But to no avail..  it only took 4 days for me to succumb to my flesh.

Where there is a will... there’s a darn way. Only wish I could say this for an actual accomplishment. Sigh.

History:
- Started PMO around when I was 14 when a “friend” introduced me to it (“Bad company corrupts good character”)
- Somehow was able to quit for a year
- Somehow got pulled back in at age 16
- 16-21 is all a blur now.. all I remember is a constant battle. There were times Id go for days, weeks, even months of freedom! But there were many times when I was a downright PMOholic. 3x a day.. everyday. I guess this is what they call an addiction. Man, how Ive wasted my life away. 

- January 2016 (21-22) Couldn’t stand it any longer. Finally Resolved to Really Quit. Confessed to my parents, close friends and spiritual leader. They gave me good guidance and prayed for me. I was determined! Got off to a good start, but I relapsed... 8 times that year. But this time the guilt didn’t kill me as much anymore “I got knocked down - but not knocked out!” And bright side is I conquered 357 days out of 365.

- 2017, had 8 months streak of victory. But man the temptation was strong. I fell 4 times that year. But still got right back up each time. Felt like a boxer/fighter still. 361/365. These past 2 years were probably my biggest growth in terms of personal awareness, character, joy, spiritual peace, social and career life too and my relationship with God. 

- 2018 - I think to myself, This is it. This is the year. This is the year I will reach Zero. I even had the opportunity to go on a Missions Trip to share the Gospel overseas. The gospel that saved a wretched man like me! It was a real eye opening experience for sure. But then I came back.. distractions of life came at me and I put my quiet time in the back burner... work piled up, activities piled up, busyness piled up, stress piled up - Then I collapsed 6 months in. 1-2-3 in a row... stopped myself.. hey atleast I still improved from last year.. let me try press on... couple months... fell again. 4th time - dang now we’re even stevens.. but then it happened.. 5-7-8-9-10-11– xxxxxx I stopped counting. So disappointed in my self. 

- New Years Eve, Did it. 2019 “New Year New Me?” who am I kidding, Did it. Next Day, did it. 

Few days gone by which lead us to the title of this post. And now we’re in the present, 

But this time Ive come to the point where I don’t even feel guilty anymore. Inside I am, but Its like I’ve lost the sensitivity of the guilt. Its weird. Many times Ive fallen as noted above, Felt really sh*tty. But then at some point resolve to be better and improve. 

But now I have no hope. No faith or trust in myself. 
 I failed my friends, my family, my God. And now myself. No fighting spirit left in me. 

I feel like this is a losing war. But I know deep down i can’t just give up... theres more to life. So Im just throwing out my life story in the dim hopes that someone can relate, and maybe save my soul. 

2:08 am. Lol isnt that familiar. Sigh. Need to sleep for work. Goodnight.

17348,Advice to NoFap,45 Days Into NoFap. Here's What i've learned. And other Tips that can help you.,"Welcome for those who seek Help or who are lurking trough this subreddit or even to those who wanna be motivated. This post is for you. 

- I learned a lot trough these years and i kinda thought to share it here since this subreddit is a place where we want to change ourselves and thanks to some people in this subreddit i kinda thought to share it here instead of sharing it to r/selfimprovement

- Should I Try NoFap?

If you ask yourself if NoFap is something you should try, then my answer to it will be a Yes. It shows you if you are really addicted to it or not and even to those who think that they can stop at any time  you should definetly try it aswell since i've been one of those people.

- Who should try NoFap?/What kind of people 
should try Nofap?

This Subreddit is dedicated to those who wanna make a change to themselves from personality to habits.

- Before i start, here is a background about me:

I started to Fap when i was around 6-8. And i hope that i'm not the only one but i discovered it by Playing Guitar with my wee wee (it's kinda embarassing but at least i've been creative around that age) trough the middle school i was around the ""different"" people since i've been bullied a lot. I had to come across a lot of mental problems which i avoided by Masturbating. Since Masturbation gives us a feel of relieve (Not to mention Dopamine). Trough that i never really improved a lot since i've masturbated that much, that i looked like a zombie. Eyelids of doom, No Facial expression or any sense of happiness (except by faking it). It was scary. I never realized how fucked up we can get if we don't find ourselves in life. Around the age of 19 i kinda started to find myself and i already joined NoFap a long time ago. But i took this as a joke because i thought to myself that i can stop at any time. Time goes by and at the age of 21 i kinda thought to myself since i can stop to pmo: ""why shouldn't i try it? Just hit day 90 and see if you get any results"". That was my mindset when i started NoFap. And since then NoFap changed me i'd say. Here are the benefits that i've gained so far: 

- Vitality

(Nothing else?) 
(Yes, because i've started it around an very early age. My body probably needs more time to see more benefits. And never forget that everyone is going to have different results at different times)

What i also have to mention since some people are Overhyping the benefits:
You won't be a god if you NoFap and the benefits you gain is Vitality and more Confidence what i've seen so far. That's it but you know what? The most important thing we need in life is Vitality since it gives us energy. You'll be less tired and you'll be able to accomplish way more tasks trough out your day. Self Discipline is also something important because if you can handle to parent yourself about NoFap, then you can parent yourself about anything. Like i started to draw and realised that everyone can be good at something if you put your time in it (and there is no such things like talent or ""he's born with it"". There are only people with benefits nothing else (there are no limits))

It also teaches you that things take time. So to those who wanna see fast results: you are gonna learn it the hard way like i do.

- Here is also an advice to those who relapse and seek advice here:

It is all about the mindset you have. Nothing else. Here are good examples:

1. Example
I'm pretty sure that most of us play games. Some of us play competitive games and it is kinda difficult to not get on tilt when you lose a game in ranked since some of us want to get an higher rank etc. Most of us have a straight mindset like: Win=Good Lose=Bad. And here is the issue in it. If you think like that, you'll  get on tilt for no reason. Hell, some people even blame their teammates and get banned in some games. Instead of focusing on your games. How about telling yourself:


- ""I play this game just to improve MY skills.""

I swear, with that mindset you'll improve 2x faster than ever since you are going to count only on  yourself and you'll be the only one who you can blame. Many people give excuses in games and because of that they will never see the mistakes they make. Only from others and that won't help them.  

2. Example
So you wanna Run each day but you can't manage it since you're kinda forcing yourself to do it. Same goes to the 1st example. Instead of saying ""i have to run"" why not saying something that tells you all the time the benefit you get after that. Here is how i motivate myself each day to run in the morning: ""I want to run to improve my health and Velocity"". you can even put something that motivates you. For example: ""i want to get the grade because i can make my family proud with it."" It Really depends how you say it! And never say thing like ""i have to"" or ""i must""!
You guys really should look at an article that is called:
Are you a victim or a designer? By stephen R. Covey (i think this is how it's called in english)


- Same goes to those who tell themselves to not Fap all the time.
I'm pretty sure that these people will never get trough 100+ days with that kind of mindset.
What i did on my journey was to embrace it. So how did i do it? I gave myself the permission to Fap whenever i like but i don't do because i don't want to. You see? Instead of despising something, how about accepting it? It doesn't make sense if you call Fapping Something like The Devil without calling heroin or gambling As The Devil. Even things that gives us a ton of Dopamine. Just accept it. You'll see that you'll care way more less since it is something you can do but remember: you won't do it because you don't want to.

I probably have nothing else to say but i really had to tell these things to someone since it kinda got stuck in my head. So i'm happy if i helped a few people with this. So i'll reach my goal if i helped at least 1 guy with it. Have great Day!",25,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ag63qw/45_days_into_nofap_heres_what_ive_learned_and/
17362,Telling my Story,You are stronger than your guiltiest of feelings,"  

Stop, its not worth it, you can do this, you are stronger than this, stop 

Hi and welcome to my story its also your story cause if your reading this you must be going through the same, but do not worry so am I and so is millions of us. 

The guiltiness consumed me from the inside and outside. Quiet literally, From the inside I felt like my whole world is crumbling I frequently lost hope, gave up and expected my self to continue being a failure for the rest of my life. From the outside I was a quiet, shy and socially awkward child who frequently found it hard to make new friends and also struggled to talk to girls-forget talking even making eye contact was pretty hard. They say writing your problems out may help you so here I am. Exams on a few days but what’s the point of studying when all you can think about is how you have failed. I frequently find myself in this very same spot This very same mindset. I do it , regret it and then recollect everything I’ve lost cause of doing it. And lemme tell u its not wort it. Not worth at all. 

But we cannot give up, especially now, now is the time , now is when we can do it, you may think you have lost It all but no not yet at least- if we continue this same path yes. But who said we will. We make our own path. Path without guilt. A path in which you never feel let down. A path in which hope overflows from you. And how do we embark this “path” you ask?

Well we recover. STOP thinking you have lost it all. You haven’t. Promise yourself that this is it. Your urges and addictions are something you have to master yourself and its not easy. It never has and never will. But here’s how we start

Week 1 will be the hardest but abstain from anything that may build that urge

Week 2 remember how hard week 1 was. Breaking it now will make no sense so keep fighting

Week 3 make plans, foresee you future, your destiny. 

For the rest of your journey make plans.

Stick to them. Foresee how bright your future can be

Remember what we are all fighting against

A war

A war against ourself 

Our Mind vs our body

Its impossible to win this war alone 

Let your mind and body unite. Our mind protecting us from our urges and our body not responding to our urges. 

Its not simple but I believe we can do it

17363,Question to NoFap,Kegels and WD,"Hey Fapless friends,

Last night and the previous night, I had a half orgasm in my sleep, because I recall the half orgasm as I was semi-conscious. However, there was no erotica dreams involved.

What I noticed is that since doing intensive kegel exercises I was able to block any liquid coming out of my penis, due to practicing the kegel technique for so long.

What I’m wondering is, can this be dangerous for my prostate? My body is obviously trying to get rid of the excess so by doing kegels to block the actual liquid coming out, am I doing anything bad?

Do you think I should just let myself do a full ejaculation in my semi conscious sleeping state next time?

Any words of wisdom would be great!

17382,Success Story,One year check-in," 

Hey guys just wanted to share some thoughts about my first full year of Nofap, and thanks to the community for putting me on the path. (Using a throwaway since my other account isn't anonymous)

All up it's been a really positive thing for me, my reasons for starting were brain fog, and feelings of guilt. My personal challenge was no porn and no jerking off to fantasises. But this has translated to total abstenence since jerking off isn't very compelling without these.

An unexpected bonus i that I'm now a lot more honest with my wife ... I can let her use my phone without panicking about having forgotten to close my browser tabs, and I can be honest with her when she asks me what I got up to while I was at home. I think deciding to be totally open about my internet usage. I didn't tell her explicitly what i was doing but knowing that she could see what I was had browsed kept me accountable. My litmus test for relapse was that I wouldn't use incognito mode or clear my history. (I only did this once i think).

I don't think that everyone needs to abstain, I'm sure most people can just take it or leave it, but for me fetish porn was very addictive, I was spending sometimes 3 hours a day jerking off to porn (in the bathroom at work lol i was in a B/S job where no one noticed). Since stopping I've changed jobs and have had so much more energy for work and my career is taking off. And at home I'm smashing through my todo lists (actually another new thing that I've started since Nofap).

One thing that was surprising was the lack of wet dreams ... i think it took me 6 months for my first. Now i have them every month or so. I guess being in my 30s my libido is just naturally going down. I've been getting amazing morning boners though haha. 

My wife and I still aren't having sex, but we've started counciling and I think we'll work things out ... I feel like i'm able to approach things a lot cleaner now.

I still think about my fetish quite a bit, but it's fading in the background and I'm more able to enjoy it without getting obsessed.

Anyway all the best to those of you who are considering trying, for me 10/10, would not fap again !",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ag6hs2/one_year_checkin/

I’ve been depressed and had anxiety for most of my life, I’ve stayed away from medication and only gone to therapy to try and help it (don’t want to get hooked) after about a year I haven’t seen much improvement and I’ve fallen into a hole in my life. I’m only young ( mid teens ) and I’m addicted to porn and masterbating. I’ve only realised lately how much of a problem it is in my life and I want to stop it. I’ve been doing it for far too long and it’s become a problem. I’ve mad it a habit and I’ve started to do it even if I wasn’t horny I was just bored. I like many other attempted “no nut November” and considering how much change happened in my life I knew I had a problem (I struggled for a few days and gave up) this is when I realised I had a problem but I ignored it and it’s only gotten me deeper into that hole. During November I discovered this sub and I was so impressed but the sheer support you guys have for each other. After weeks of contemplation I have decided to change my life and finally put a stop to my awful habits. Thank you all for the support, I have been changed by some of the posts on here during my previous attempts but now I’m committed to this change. I want to be a better person.

17461,Emergency - Help!,10 Months of NoFap &amp; Libido/S*x Drive in non-existent. Please Help!,"Hey guys,

I have been on my NoFap journey for about 10 months now. A few relapses here and there but if worked out as a percentage of the number of days spent in the N.F. state of mind then my relapses will be minuscule.

Anyways, as you have read in my title after 10 months on this journey my libido has disappeared. Can someone please tell me if it will ever come back? Before N.F. my libido was high, not for real girls but for the on screen filth, I could simply think about my favorite scenes and get rock hard. However last month when I was about to have my last relapse I couldn't go ahead with it because now even the on screen dirt won't turn me on. I could literally sit in front of my computer and watching 100's of videos and I had no desire for the women on screen.

Now not only don't I have any desire for the on screen girls but I honestly don't have the drive to pursue real life women either.

If any of you guys are long term N.F. followers can you please tell me if this is a flat-line? I have tried everything to fix my libido. Maca, Vit. D, Zinc, Magnesium, Beef, Eggs, Milk, Organic Grass Fed Butter, Brazil Nuts and so on and so forth. I've still got no s\*x drive.

I hope some of you can share your experiences and give me hope. As you can understand it is a weird feeling to lose my libido. Yes before N.F. my libido was linked to filth but at least I had a libido and high s\*x drive!

It is honestly the weirdest feeling to be only 23 and going through this. I just need your guys' advice and I hope there's a light at the end of this tunnel.

17464,Advice to NoFap,Count your,"EJACULATIONS

This morning i got the unusual idea to try n estimate how many times i have ejaculated (btw the amount of videos watched will always be astronomically higher than your ejaculation number so i didn't bother to count those). but i dug deep in my memory and went back to the age it all started at.12. 

Basically i approximated how many times i ejaculated per day from the age of 12 per year. so at the age of 12 i approximately ejaculated 2-3 times a day (which is the average, so im not including extra frisky days at all). but to be accurate ill just say 2 times a day. so 2 times a day for 1 year was at the least 730!!! times at the time of 12 years old, assuming i started day 1 January first which in all likelihood i ejaculated plenty of times to make up a year worth of ehaculation. 

So if we assume 730 times a year times 14 years (i'm 26 now) that means that at the LEAST i have ejaculated 10,200+ times from the age of 12 until yesterday basically. at the MOST (considering there were a ton of 3x a day sessions) im at 15,300+. so WELL over 15,000 times i have ejaculated. 

When i thought about this number it was a wave of sadness came over me. FIFTEEN THOUSAND times i have succumbed to my lust of a female. And the most sad part about that number is that none of those ejaculations were inside a woman. ZERO!!!!!!! times i have been able to be stimulated enough to cum inside a chick. all because my dick is accustomed to the grip of my hand, and my perception of sex is so perverted and unrealistic combined with the fact that i haven't even been with a chick that SLIGHTLY resembles the chicks i beat my junk too. 

I have released SO MUCH energy and testosterone and semen to fantasies and porn. and this is a wake up call if i ever had one. this number tells me that 15,000 times i have felt UTTERLY unwanted by a woman. 15,000 times i have rejected the idea of approaching the type of woman i want and desire. 

NO MORE, i will not allow women to control me any fucking more. I don't blame women, i blame myself for lusting after an insane amount of women that i will never get the chance to fuck. i blame myself for not realizing that my greatest power over women is to make them want me. i lost that power every time i ejaculated. it changed my mind, it changed my attitude. it made me so fearful to even look a woman in the eye because i feel physically insecure about myself exterior and scared shitless that she can reas my mind about my porn addiction. i am so changed by porn and women that i convince myself that if i show any sign of liking a woman or being attracted to her that i will be labeled. labeled unattractive, labeled as that guy that hits on women. 

FUCK THAT, its time to change the brain. its time to heal, its time to let the fish come to ME. its time to remove this attachment to women. its time to improve and fix my insecurities. its time to educate myself, its time to focus, its time to be more humble than ever before. its time to keep my head up n straight, ITS TIME!!!!!",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ag874y/count_your/

17486,Telling my Story,"Have been trying NoFap for about two weeks now, longish story with gathered ideas, might be of use.","One day I thought about it and stumbled on the r/nofap page, again.


I've been here before and researched, I will tell you that I don't think that you shouldn't ever masturbate. I think there is scientific evidence that masturbating sometimes is good for you and never masturbating is bad for you (Pornography is a whole another story).  

BUT, being a little mommas boy, 24yo, living with my parents, not able to take responsibility of anything, having an AWESOME gf and not appreciating it has brought me to a choice and ultimatum, once again.  
Now, I know that If I set myself rules, I will break them. I've been like this, always. But If I suggest myself to try something out, to forget about something that is not important to me, I can easily refrain and substitute given activity with something else. And that's why I always eat healthy, rarely drink and never, smoke, ever again.  

**What I've found is that these two weeks I've restarted and started activities that I've neglected even the ideas of, for example:**  
* Tinkering with audio electronics  
* Read actual books (5 pages minimum)  
* Refrain from social media (I bookmark my facebook groups and events page, other than that, only messenger...and reddit)  
* Discipline myself in various ways (making my bed, waking up early[still practicing], even looking for ways to format my text better on reddit)  
* Creating a list of news sites that don't use clickbait that much (the one I always read was more of scrolling various images with shitty titles)  
* actually doing schoolwork  
**I wish I dealt more with:**  
* learning investing, economy, music, languages and math  
* moving out from home  
* looking for a job  
* creating a consistent calisthenics plan

Now, with all that in mind I did a simple thing, and didn't open some idiotic porn site and start edging myself like I always had liked to do. Instead what I did is, I walked out of the room, and started looking for any kind of chores I could do, went for a walk, I took any other kind of action to get my mind off from porn. I had built up such disrespect for looking at ass pics of random women, it's just disgusting.  
And you think it was easy? You know, I had to learn to **like** the itchy feel that not getting off gives you. No blue balls or anything but just the frustrating feel that will not give way easily. I wasn't really strong or a hero in my opinion, but I was:  
* forgetful (of having the opportunity)  
* looking for tiny small steps to do anything to get my mind elsewhere  
* reminding myself that I like **the feel**, because **the feel** is:  
 * a sign of rising libido  
 * a sign of drive to do something (else)  
 * a stimulus  
 * actually enjoyable  
 * completely forgettable  
One thought about pornography in our time of life, I have heard now from two people, a local famous psychic and couple years later from a local stand-up comedian, and I will cite the comedian, that ""In the old days, when you saw a knee... You ejaculated in your pants. Nowadays it's all choke me daddy and throw me down the roof. And still nothing."" I like the idea, of being like a horny teenager again. But more like a very-able adult.

That's all folks! I, anyway, am going to continue my journey.

**I want to thank:**  
* r/NoFap  
* My barber, that casually said, that ""I don't trust a man that whacks off"" (actually talking to someone else)  
* My gf's grandpa, that casually said ""I do not beat off!""  
* everyone whose actions and sayings have nudged me towards refraining from touching myself",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ag8i6f/have_been_trying_nofap_for_about_two_weeks_now/

17515,Journal Check-In,Daily journal entry: day 3,"I don’t feel so good, not ill but not great either. I can feel sensations in my brain that something is happening because of Nofap. Concentration fluctuating during the day. Still no urges and Nofap is easy so far, I think I’m on a flatline because I feel no sexual attraction to opposite sex at all. 

Update: it’s interesting because I wasn’t feeling great during the morning and afternoon, I little depressed and sad but in the evening my emotions did a complete 180 and now I feel happy. Stuff like this is common, my emotions fluctuate a lot from depression to happiness. This is the result of Nofap since emotions are rooted in sexual energy. ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ag8x0s/daily_journal_entry_day_3/
17522,Question to NoFap,Is this what they call the flatline?,"I noticed that today, I'm acting kinda different. For one, while I still have the power to do work and have the appetite to eat or the interest to take a bath, I feel like kinda unenthusiastic to unnecessary things. However, most notably, I completely lost all interest to fap or watch porn (I was having urges, but I was able to kill the urges, but since today, I completely had no urges. Like, I even considered ""what, no interest to porn? Unbelievable, let me try watching one"" but as I was about to reach for my phone, I was like, ""ah what a waste of time. Who cares. Good riddance, I guess"" I was also on the toilet (I bring my phone to the toilet for music) and while I used to get the worst urge of the day during those moments, I completely had no urges that time. Is this the flatline?

Also, can I add one small question? I always get like, a total of 1 small drop of semen every day through urine. After I piss, I notice that a drop is still coming out, and upon further inspection, its consistency is exactly like semen. This has only happened two times on my previous (longest) streak of 17 days, but it is happening almost everyday now, although on smaller quantities. I'm pretty sure this is to be expected when doing nofap (especially since I started fapping since I was 5, believe it or not--I'll tell the story once I reach 90 days \[and I heckin' swear, I will this time, and even more\]) but just confirming--this is okay, right?

I currently experience no pain, no blue balls, nothing. Just like a normal day--except without PMO. Oh, and without urges as of today.

I would really appreciate hearing your opinion on this.

17554,Telling my Story,Life is too beautiful for you to kill yourself emotionally,"Just sitting here this morning after meditating and I started listening to Blackmill while sipping some coffee with my cat in my lap when I realized that music sounded so much better than it usually does. Then it dawned on me... life is beautiful. Life is precious. I don't know, I just teared up because I realized that life isn't meant to be so bland. We have all fucked ourselves in our heads with porn and it's so hard to see out of it. It's so hard because your senses are dulled. You can't experience a full life without full emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

I think a lot of us have started this NoFap journey because we want the ""superpowers."" We want our life to be better, and we want results. Every single time I've done NoFap (7 days three times, 13 and 14 are my highest streaks) I have always muscled through it because I wanted results, with my relapse coming because I lost willpower. Today it dawned on me that it isn't even about that. It's about being a person again. It's about being able to have eye contact and being able to enjoy music and having conversations and learning how to love. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I sound like a hippy. But I just wanted to share this with everyone here, who one week ago helped me with the darkest relapse I've ever had. I was so embarrassed by it I had to make a second account to seek help, but despite that I still found help here from this community, and I think that I am on the right path now.

I am a 15yo teen guy who decided to include nofap in his life. I was impressed by your results and wanted to try it too! Every time after I masturbated I didn't have the power to do nothing, the only thing I wanted to do was to sit on my bed scrolling down on instagram.

Today is the 2nd day of my journey and I feel so motivated to go on! I have much more willing to pursue my goals. The only problem is that I feel sooo horny all the time! I have an erection 24/7 and can't stop thinking girls and looking at insta pictures of them... I don't even touch down there, should I also avoid pictures to become horny? Is it healthy for a testosterone driven teen boy not to listen to his urges? I'm a bit confused because many people say that fapping is healthy and normal. What do you think?

I feel a lot has changed in these last 45 days. There is a major shift in perspective. Some of which i have listed below:

I am much more peaceful and content than ever. 

I have started to ponder deeply upon real issues and problems with life and have started to come up with practical solutions to those problems as well. 

Instead of wasting time on mindlessly fapping and watching porn I have started to better utilise every resource that universe has endowed me with.

I have stopped complaining, effortlessly.

I am less irritated, almost never depressed, and I have started laughing a lot more than ever.

I feel much more focused for the task at hand.

I don't know how to explain this… but i feel more ""clean"".

I suddenly got a confidence boost and i feel like I can solve problems on my own. This feeling gives immense inner strength.

Thanks you so much guys.... It's all because of you all and yours stories and motivation. Lets keep going and lets keep improving.

17659,Question to NoFap,No Girls...,"So I'm starting my second semester at college and I've just realized something that's kind of making me reevaluate my life choices. I am a CS major at a school that is already like 60% guys and 40% girls. Now I've gone to 2 of my classes and I've only seen like 4 girls. I definitely don't revolve my life around chasing women but the fundamental reason why I struggle with PMO is loneliness and lack of female contact. Literally just having female friends makes it so much better for me. Hugs and human contact are something I crave that guys generally just aren't comfortable doing with one another. Also the dudes in most of my classes are not socially outgoing in the slightest and I don't feel like I have that much in common with them. I don't want to make friends with them as bad as that sounds. 

I don't want to not have a social life because of my major so I've got 2 choices: I try to join clubs and such where I can meet other people or I switch majors. I think a big reason why I'm feeling this way also is because my roommate switched to pyschology and he was very quick to inform that ""it's where all the hot girls are at."" I can't believe I'm considering changing my life plan for this but I spent one day here already and I was incredibly lonely, thinking that at least once class started I'd be able to make some friends and join some social circles, now I'm not so sure.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/agbikh/no_girls/

17681,Multimedia,Reading - I am Legend,"First off, if y'all haven't read this book don't worry I'm not  going to spoil anything I'm only like 40 pages in. Reading this book has been extremely eye opening because of the struggles that Neville goes through in regards to his sexual urges. I'll give a quick synopsis on where the story picks up, basically everyone is a vampire (virus) and Neville is alone in his house. He collects supplies during the day but at night boards himself in his house. The vampires in his neighborhood (old neighbors and friends) come out and yell at him to come out (they want to eat him or suck his blood idk).

His wife and daughter died before the book started, not sure how ATM probably vampires. He's been alone and so he watches through a peephole as the vampires prowl his lawn. Well one of the women notices him peeping and they begin to start doing very lewd things in an attempt to coax him out. He's been without his wife for 5 months and the horniness is almost unbearable for him. I won't go into detail because I don't want to trigger anyone but they in my mind are the equivalent of porn. He knows that they are false, only offering him sexual reprive so they can eat him. And yet he still considers it, it's a constant battle in his head. Desire fighting with logic. How insane is that? They want to eat the poor bastard and his brain is still trying to get him to go out there. That is porn. We know it will eat our lives and yet our brain still tells us to go to it. The pressure is so intense that we don't think logically. It won't even sate our thirst, we know. It only intensifies it. And yet we listen to the sirens call because our hormones overpower our higher brain function. Neville doesn't give in and neither will I.

17692,Telling my Story,ED Fucked My Life Over!,"Just fyi, i am not new to nofap, i've been on nofap since last november and my streak is according to my flair. i've also been on reddit for some time but just made a new account. 

this is kind of a long story, just bear with me.

alright, some backstory, I am a 15 year old dude, got in a relationship with a girl during the summer of 2018, long distance. 

We met online on a sort of app for meeting new friends/girls. We were chatting and things progressed in our relationship very quickly. she lived in another town so i didn't meet her irl until a little while later. she was very quick to call me ""baby"" over the phone and send quite sexual photos of herself. she later after a few weeks asked me If i wanted to be her boyfriend. Me with my virgin dude-brain said yes and all of a sudden we were a couple, online. Then she started talking subtly about us having sex, not mentioning it directly, just like ""hinting"" towards it. 

I also talked about this alot with my friends when all of this was happening and they started saying, like guys our age do, you should totally go to her house and sleep with her. I allways thought ""I really like this girl, If I'm gonna meet her, it should probably be because of an interest in her personality"" but in the back of my head was allways a little goblin telling me to ""LOSE MY VIRGINITY"". I didn't admit it but this put alot of pressure on me. 

fastforward a week, we decided to meet in her town over the weekend so i planned on taking the bus. we planned on meeting in town then going to her place to chill. i packed myself a pair of soft pants and... a condom, just in case. 

everything went as planned and when i arrived, there she stood. We hugged, kissed and talked and everything was alright. we walked back to her house, about a 30 min walk from the station. we got into her house and i got dressed in the bathroom and she got dressed in her room. i walked into her and we sat down on the bed and started making out. i immediately got a boner, rock solid, and i thought ""woah, i might actually get laid today"" 

we made out and cuddled and sorta rubbed up against eachother for like an hour, and i think she actually came a bit. then i just went for it and asked ""Do you wanna?"" and she said ""yeah"". I got up from the bed to retrieve my condom from my backpack, now i was really nervous, still rock hard though, while she was under the covers taking her panties off. I removed my pants and put the condom on, now i was like 90% hard. i got under the covers and the moment she touched my dick, i went into panic mode. my heart started rushing, i started doubting myself, i started sweating and my dick instantly went completely limp. sadly, we didn't have sex. instead we just cuddled for the rest of my stay and made out and basically just fooled around until i went home.

i never made any advancments to have sex all through the relationship till we eventually broke up.

she treated me very badly during the relationship but i won't go into that right now.

NOW, The reason why this shit has sort of fucked me up is that it has created this huge mental block for me. as soon as i think about me having sex with a woman the same feelings as that time come creeping up on me and i lose my erection. 

I could really need some advice, perhaps someone has gone through the same thing, do you guys think nofap will cure or atleast help with this?

Benefits so far:

-Better sleep. I don’t need to sleep 9 hours anymore, 6.5 is all I need to feel energized and ready 😎 I also have a lot less daily fatigue and can fall asleep faster.

-More self-confidence and self-conscience. I have been more aware of my appearance, how I dress, how I talk, etc. Approaching the opposite sex has become much easier. Better conversations with people in general. Socializing is fun again!

-Increased self-discipline and will power. Doing this coupled with meditation has pit me in a space where I am much more aware of EVERYTHING I do on a daily basis. Meditation actually made me decide to commit to NoFap in the first place! I have an easier time planning things out and sticking to them. I also decided to quit smoking weed, something I never could have pulled off in the past. 

-Improved overall mood. I don’t feel as blue anymore, just blue-balled 😛

-More energy!! This is my favorite part. My gym runs are more intense and I have a diffferent mind set. I don’t run out if breath as easily; a 30 minute run is NOTHING compared to when I was masturbating.

I'm working on trying to deepen my bond with this girl at work, I've been there about 3 months. We were making some progress sharing lunch together and nearly got to drinks but she's gone a bit cold this week. She asked me for drinks midweek last week and I couldn't do it as I was running on 3 hours sleep, so I asked her again Friday but she wasn't up for it now since then she's not really been looking over, but I think she's just got something else on her mind. So, I'm just backing off a bit, occasionally letting her know I'm there in case she wants to talk but otherwise just giving her some space.

I've got other female friends I'm working on chatting to more whilst I do that.

Anyway, I'm digressing... Fact is - these last few days I've thought... I don't even want sex at the moment, I just want a deep bond with a girl I'm attracted to so I feel some catharsis when we hug.

Because these relationships are growing slowly, I feel a bit low and lonely so all not getting my hug.

Surprise surprise I want to ""hug myself"" in the only way I know how.

So I start grazing Instagram and my pants come down.

But I've stopped before anything could happen and instantly went floppy when I left Instagram.

I won't let it happen. I'm just really tired and need to sleep now.

Beginning of a flatline I think.",14,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/agdl4j/there_are_no_hacks_to_needing_a_hug/

I've seen a post about feeling all those emotions and pain You tried to keep down with fapping some time ago here and I totally get it now.

You might be wondering why I said I felt good today but also that I feel a little frustrated and maybe even depressed at the moment, so let me explain. I finally got to just...DO stuff. I'm 19yo and I finally had my first driving lesson, I renewed the floor in my apartment and started to work out as well as taking walks nearly every day. So that's the good thing: I just feel more alive and I feel the potential I have and I already got a little more confident around other people. Bad things are that I still am pretty lonely and it actually depresses me that it might take some time to find myself in a good and healthy relationship again.  
I felt this extreme urge to just fap. I didn't even watch porn or anything, I just wanted to fap. I even caught myself thinking that ""it's probably okay if I do it without porn"" and stuff like that. BUT instead of just giving in I thought about the feelings I have now and my feelings will be if I am done fapping. So I actually got up and took a walk to get my head clear and took a nap afterwards. I won't lose this streak just because I'm anxious. Fuck this. I feel better every day without PMO and I won't lose any kind of progress.

18042,Motivation,This is a tough addiction,"As an alcoholic who recently got clean, I have much more temptation to jerk off than to drink. I'm at 48 days and am going to keep pushing through. Sometimes I have the thought to do it just once to get it out of my system but I know that will swiftly lead to me doing it everyday again. When the cravings come just remember it's only a thought and you don't have to act on it. Instead address the thought, assess it, understand why you're having it and what it means to you, and then it's your choice to act on it or dismiss it. The two biggest causes of suffering are craving and avoidance and that's exactly what pmo is; it's craving sex/pleasure/dopamine or whatever you get out of it, and it's also a way to avoid and get away from problems/pain/feelings/unpleasantness temporarily but all those problems are still there when you're done but now you have even less willpower to deal with them.  I guess all I'm trying to say is this is a challenging addiction to overcome especially now with smartphones and access to pornography 24/7. Our brains haven't evolved to deal with the instant gratification and the excessive amounts of dopamine that internet pornography supplies. I'm of myself for my second longest streak of 48 days and proud of all of you for coming to the realization pmo is a problem for many of us today and are doing something about it.

Go out...get yourself a lady...or man if you swing that way. Then if you don't want to do that at least do something productive like going to the gym. 

So in a way...thank you porn ads for making me feel lonely? Strange flex but okay lmao

This past week has been quite good. I've been very careful of my thoughts, and have quite successfully cut off any unhealthy pathway that leads to the small but snowballing hits of dopamine associated with my addiction. Daily meditation (Satanama mostly with some other variations thrown in) has been instrumental in controlling my thoughts, and of course the applied knowledge from my readings. I have made a very good start in my triathlon training, with rapid improvement of running endurance during drills on the treadmill. I have made a small effort to begin my stationary bike training but will hopefully make swifter progress in that area in the coming week. Unfortunately the pool is still out of commission so no luck there (a little frustrating). Another slight pump in the road has been my (old, from 4 months ago) bicep injury flared up during my weekly bouldering training and really hit hard during my upper body resistance training the next day. Thankfully the dopamine hits from running have been quite helpful, it feels good to get rewarded for something actually worth while for once. Classes are Ok, although I'm finding it hard to motivate to work on my project. I need to better organize myself so as to stay busy and not slack-off thinking I have all kinds of free time. Thankfully I have not indulged in any wasteful activities during this time (i.e. video games/Netflix/Social media), all of which further sap motivation for me through incentive salience. I have been productive socially throughout the week which has also greatly helped. In the coming week I would like to work on my productivity and organization, while maintaining the progress which I have made.

18189,Motivate Me,Nofap and bipolar disorder,"Anyone deal with this or any other mental health issues and currently taking psychiatric drugs? I’ve just given up on myself since being diagnosed and feel like what’s the point of nofap. I’d really like to hear some experiences, advice, and gain some motivation. Even start a conversation around the matter. 

My will to live a meaningful life is really low at this moment and I’m stuck most days doing nothing and feeling terrible all the time. I feel like a failure due to past decisions and embarrassing things I’ve done during episodes I’ve had. 

Before diagnosis i was determined to change and achieved long streaks. I unfortunately was abusing drugs and alcohol at the time to subdue my urges and wasn’t doing it the hard and disciplined way. The abuse I feel led to an episode and diagnosis rather then being something genetic. I feel deep down I may not have this disorder though. The meds on the other hand I feel really changed me for the worse. 

 I do realize though that nofap can be the catalyst for changing my life for the better. The countless reddit posts and experiences justify that. I’ve been trying for years now to permanently quit pmo. I knew about this community for a long time now and read many stories and experiences. Even watched a ton of YouTube videos on nofap.

I feel by abstaining from sexual desires and doing nofap the right way, can even allow me to live med free and live a wonderful life. I feel it could even change my brain on an organic level, changing the chemical makeup and neuropathways in my brain to potentially undo the damage I’ve done. Even potentially changing my diagnosis.

Could that be possible? Is there any hope? Anyone have that experience?

I’d be willing to try to see if it can be done and share my experience to help others but deep down I’m scared of who I could be. 

I’ve lasted only a few days before I relapse. This has been happening for a long time now and I’m basically just caught up in the same cycle. I’ve been in a depression going on 2 years almost. 

Just a question if someone can give their opinion please (I know it’s best to ask my doctor) 

Should I start a serious streak while taking the psychiatric drugs or wait till I’m off of them? In about 5 months or so I’ll be trying to be drug free with doctor supervision.

Three is also a feeling of tightness in my throat which I hate. On long streaks like the one im on currently my voice I can project my voice a lot clearer and with assertiveness and repectably deep.

&gt;when pmo-ing regularly I develop pimples that leave dark scars on my face. My face is riddled with these scars and atleast brings me from a 8 to a 6. This has given me seriously cripling self esteem and confidence  issues. Right now on my streak of 2 weeks I haven't gotten a single new pimple and my scars have seemed to fade away.

&gt;when pmo ing regularly I get no dreams whatsoever. My dreams recently have been vivid, intense, realistic and a lot of times disturbing. Yesterday I had a horrible dream of murdering a person by stabbing them in the throat and then shooting myself in the head to kms. I've never done anything in my life that violent so I'm slightly concerned. I also get dreams of people I haven't seen in 4-5 years.

&gt;Greatly reduced my time playing vidya. Went from playing 4-5 hrs a day down to 1-2 and my rank on rainbow six seige has increased a lot which I could attribute to mental clarity.

18432,Telling my Story,I'm Ready,"Yesterday, I relapsed again. Only after one day this time. This second relapse has made me really think. At first I was doing this just to challenge myself, just to see if I could not watch porn and masturbate to it. And I see now that I shouldn't be challenging myself. I should be using this opportunity to better myself. Looking back at the past 13 years or so (I'm 21) I've been a slave to masturbating to porn. It was a way for me to escape from reality; like how someone would watch a movie, play a game, pick up a hobby, etc. It got to the point where I started to spend money on it. I've probably spent ~$400 on it minimum. I know when compared to some people that's not much, but for me it's too much.

Porn and masturbation was all I could ever think about. I couldn't wait till I got home from school just so I could rub a couple quick ones out. And the weekends were the worst. I would spend 3/4 of the day doing nothing but masturbating. It consumed me for more than half of my life.

But now I'm ready to be done. I'm ready to start living my life.

So as a result I've spent the past half hour going through both my phone and my computer, and deleted everything related to porn. After I deleted each item, I felt a pit in my stomach. I felt, and still feel, anxious. But I know that by doing so, I that much closer to getting rid of this addiction. I'm done lying to myself, saying that what I'm doing is perfectly fine and normal. I've added the day counter to keep myself accountable.

I know from scrolling on here that it's gonna be rough, and in fact my first post on here was asking for some advice as to how some of you make it through the first week or so.

1. Started waking up at 4:20AM (no to blaze it lol) to study. Earlier I used to sleep until 8:00AM.

2. Started running. Because I don't really have a hobby and there is nothing I am particularly good at (except driving) so I thought why not give it a shot. 
Started running from yesterday and it felt awesome. Tonnes of energy. 
I used to run 2 years ago but then... You know what it is. Also I noticed that fapping reduced my endurance to 50% of what it was before. Will work on endurance a lot.

3. Ultra hard morning woods. Its so hard that its kinda hard to get it down.

Still to do list:

1. Cold showers: Yeah yeah I know. Its f-ing 6 degrees here in India (and btw thats really cold according to Indian standard) how am I supposed to do that.

PROBLEMS
1. STILL NO WET DREAM. 
2. Still not much attention from opposite sex

The first relapse happened before I knew it, granted I was peeking and that led to light touching but then boom! It’s all kicking off and I’ve got to deal with a sticky situation. Since then it’s been too easy to slip back again. 

I was determined to not make an issue of it, treat it as a little mistake and carry on with my progress. Every time something like this happens it reveals just how impulsive I am and that PMO is the root of it all. 

Now I’m starting to crave a joint first thing in the morning and going back to watching things I don’t even enjoy until I can barely stay awake. I even put the dial on the shower back to the red zone. 

I don’t know what I need in order to stay disciplined, whether it’s some form of punishment or reward. I know there’s no quick fix but there has to be a way to help yourself resist.

18613,Advice to NoFap,A word of caution and encouragement,"Fellow members of this community, I implore you not to pay much attention to posts that engage in deliberate detraction. I found myself reading two or three posts and articles which discounted the existence of benefits, and I was bummed for the rest of the day. Suffice it to say, it brought me very close to relapse. But I persisted, and did not relapse.  


My advice: Avoid reading articles which question the efficacy of the process. We all need some amount of imaginative push to cross over the hurdle of addiction. Humour yourself a little by enjoying any real or perceived benefits. Bottomline? You would at least be cured of porn addiction, and that is itself a reward beyond measure.  


I am new to this community and proud to say it has been the single most important source of information and motivation! I feel confident I will go all the way just because of the existence of this community.  


I don't need to reiterate that the benefits are indeed real!

18619,Motivation,"Attention control story, yay meditation","TL:DR; Anything that requires you to simultaneously maintain intense focus and near total relaxation works as meditation. 

So if you don't fancy sitting, do whatever you do the 'zen way' - only focus on what you're doing and bring your mind back gently to what you're doing. It's the same thing you do in meditation but now it's more tailored to your life. If you hit a rough patch this can make a difference between keeping your cool and getting out of the rough quicker or losing your shit and sinking deeper.
Praise post for meditation/mindfulness/'directing attention'/'attention control'/'deep work'. This sub led me to genuinely take up meditation and to apply it to my life so here's a bit of the benefits and story - hopefully those who read can benefit as I did.

From 2004 to 2011 or so I had a dream to be a professional musician and practised for hours every day concentrating intensely. I no longer want that because reasons and that's irrelevant to this post, but here's a cool thing that came from that: the ability to maintain focus or to switch focus from one thought to another and keep it where I want it to be.

Hit a rough patch working in a few dodgy places with dodgy people for around 8 years starting 2008 and couldn't take the stress as I couldn't practice any more or do anything I used to do due to circumstances. This really set me back as I was constantly stressed out and rushing to get things done, made me irritable and mentally sluggish as I couldn't even have time to read for a few years in a row.

In my case it was a coincidence that pulled me out of this rough patch (or maybe that I was fed up to the point of being ready to start slapping people for being dumb lol) but now I 'meditate' all day, every day. I got this down to the point of just using the technique to calm myself and relax for a few breaths and then get on with my day.
Used to worry about every passing thought and compare myself to others in better circumstances (that was excuse #1 for anything, worst of all it actually fit reality half the time which helped fool myself into not taking action, bad approach). Now I can appreciate others' work and achievements without comparing myself to them. Focusing on a single thing like your breath or your steps when you're walking, or a single instrument in the song you happen to listen to (kick drums work great) really calms you down and builds your ability to enjoy life whatever comes your way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Day 20! Before I found this community or why NoFap made me feel better, around this time I would relapse—so, thanks, to you amazing people for keeping me going!

I think I'm at the [""flatline""](https://www.nofap.com/glossary/), because my mood and libido definitely have changed from the excitement I felt around last week. I feel slightly on edge and not very eager to interact with people. There's a girl at work I always had a little crush on and eager to talk to. Yesterday, I sat alone with her in the lunchroom, I just read a book and I couldn't care less about her. She's wrong for me in every way, so not having any feelings for her is actually a positive for me, but it just felt strange to not care about her.

I don't have a girlfriend, so I'm doing Hard Mode NoFap. Even brief contact with my dick now, like when peeing or when clothes press on it give me a boner. On some baser, animalistic level I feel like I **must** get a girlfriend or shit will be bad. In the past, porn made me think I didn't need a girlfriend at all, because it was easier to fap. I think what's happening now is that bullshit self-brainwashing is gone and my brain is following a more natural pathway and thinks I should find a proper ""mate"". I'm keeping myself busy with hobbies and I hope this feeling of having one stuck in the chamber will pass.

**But... there's no going back**. I've signed up for classes for my hobbies, and I know if I fap, I'll stop going and that'll hurt my skill progress. I'm much friendlier and *actually talk to* several of my coworkers, and I know if I fap, I'll become an antisocial hermit again. I currently feel like I'm an open, friendly, and empathetic ""boss"" to some of the coworkers I manage, and I know if I fap, I'll become a lot more difficult for them to deal with. I think part of me feeling a bit down right now is because I'm starting to get used to the new me. I'm starting to forget how much of a neurotic, antisocial shit fapping makes me.

In any case, my sights are now set on Day 30. The first month of NoFap. And I'll end on a very positive note: I now feel very at ease and comfortable talking to hot girl strangers. In the past, I'd be this creep who'd stare and if I had to stand or do something next to a hot girl, I'd present this pissed-off persona, where I'd be just doing what I was doing and ignoring the hot girl entirely. It changed now. A couple of days ago, I was at the store looking for some furniture. On the shelf, there were a bunch of white stands that were exactly what I was looking for, but I didn't like the color.

Lo and behold, next to the shelf is this super hot girl standing with the same furniture I want, except in the dark colour. I immediately asked her where she got it and when she said she took the last one off the shelf, I said, ""oh well, maybe I'll go with these smaller dark ones. Thanks!"" Yes, it's just a little small-talk that's likely nothing special for many people, but for me freely talking like that to attractive strangers is definitely a barrier to overcome.

I walked around to other shelves and then came back. The girl pointed to her stand and said ""if you want it you can have it"". I said ""are you sure? Awesome! Thanks!"" and I was really happy and smiling and she too smiled a lot back at me. I think this was one of those instances where it's perfectly appropriate to ask someone out on a date—I didn't, but it was mostly because I didn't think of it rather than that I was shy, like I'd normally be when I fapped. But this little experience definitely showed me that I am comfortable talking to attractive girls and the next time opportunity presents itself, I'll try asking them out on date :)

Stay strong people! Day 30, I'm coming to you!

18646,Journal Check-In,Combination Time... Day 1,"I've just come off the back of a pretty poor run. But the more I study myself, and porn, and masturbation, and the way the world is set up, the more I realise something important...

**Society is set up to brainwash us into mediocrity.**

It feeds us bad foods that make us overweight and lethargic, it feeds us sexualized media, it feeds us distraction and fear and negativity.

Now... I could play the victim here and say there's nothing I can do, and it's not my fault.

**OR I can man up and break free of the chains.**

I can say:

NO LONGER WILL I STAND FOR THE BULLSHIT THAT THE WORLD IS SERVING UP TO ME ON A DAILY BASIS.

Just the simplest thing... I was preparing a meal for me and my wife last night and as I made up the gravy I looked at the jar... first ingredient... Maltodextrin.

What the fuck is Maltodextrin?

Sugar.

In fact, it's *worse* than sugar.

And I know for a fact (from waking up to my habits and patterns) that if I have refined carbs I have a 10x risk of relapsing into porn and masturbation.

I came to realise there's a twofold attack needed here... not optional, but necessary.

**Nutrition and NoFap combined.**

And that's combined with (as we all know really) being OK with myself. Building self-image and self-confidence.

And I believe that comes from saying 'no' to the BS and brainwashing. **Standing up no my own two feet, choosing the decisions that work for me, ignoring the so-called 'experts' who tell me massively conflicting stuff, and finding my own route to success.**

I was thinking about the nutrition thing...

I'm not *ignorant.* I know what foods I shouldn't eat, yet I still eat them.

And that leaves only two options... I'm either *stupid* or else I *hate myself.*

And here's the rub... I *know* I'm not stupid.

**So the only conclusion I could come to is that I hate myself.**

There's the core issue right there.

Until I can learn not to hate myself, I'm going to be trapped in the cycle of shitty food, shitty PMO habits and a shitty life.

SO how do you go about not hating yourself?

My plan right now is to slowly achieve stuff. Set small goals and see them through. Prove to myself that I am capable and smart, that I have a place in the world, that I am valuable and that I matter.

And not take myself too seriously.

I'm on a mission right now to really heal my self-confidence... another post to follow on that.

I should have known better though because all the picture online showed was her fat juicy ass and said she was 27. I get to the hotel room where she incalled me and it was a 50 some year old lady. Shs had a big ass mind you but she was old and smelled of cigarettes. Next we started a body massage which made me bust 10 mins into the encounter and it pissed me off. She was ready for me to leave and I was so disappointed that I told her the hour isn't up and so we spent the rest of the 35 40 mins rubbing oil on each other to try and wake me up but the best I could manage was a semi hard state in which after putting the condom on and fuckinh that way,wasnt that enjoyable.  After leaving I felt depression set back. Now all I can think about is if I got an std cause when we were rubbing up against each other I could have sworn my dick went in unprotected but she was like don't worry its not. Also it didn't help me in any way about getting over my ex wife of which much of my current anxiety stems from.  All I could think about when she was sucking my dick was if my ex was doing something like this to another man and even trying to fantasize about it to get me hard because that 50 some year old lady wasn't doing it.  I then woke up this morning deliberatly leaving my phone in the car so I'm not tempted to pmo (cause urges hit me hardest in bed morninhs and night) and just MO'd to thinking about the escort's ass in my mind.

But as you saw from the title, I recently moved to a new place and I'm not taking it well. Though I haven't started fapping  twice or more a day, I'm having PMO  about once a day and I really dislike that.

I don't hate my house or anything, in fact I rather like it, I think that it's just when I originally got into porn it was a coping mechanism, and I don't need it anymore but it's hard to break out of. I am a much stronger person than when I started watching porn.

I’m feeling I have better control of my emotions, I can feel the energy building up. I wonder how long I can keep this up before it starts getting difficult. I have a theory that I will do the 90 days easily this time because I overcame a significant piece of my trauma during childhood which was what caused my addiction to sexual arousal and instant gratification. Each day I find more repressed emotions coming forward, I’m doing my best to process those emotions so they don’t cause problems. It starts with my dreams, I have been getting dreams of the trauma I’ve repressed and I’m working myself into resolving them now, I’m finding my happiness has increased significantly since I’ve been doing this work.

18846,Telling my Story,What's Done is Done !,"My First Day in Reddit..&amp; also my first day after n×n no. of relapses..So I just wanted to share my past so far..

I started mastrubating on my own since very young and I found porn  for the first time when I was 12 yrs old.Now I'm 20.
I got into P by myself. I first felt crazy thinking I was the only one doing M but when I later slowly found out that everyone of my age was doing it I felt a relief which later lead me to believe that P&amp;M is a  normal thing to do.
As months passed,my P use increased and also my taste varied.I got addicted to Extreme,Abusive,Violent &amp; Rape categories.

I found nofap last november.I always knew that I was addicted to P and I would somehow manage to get over it in the Future.But when I found out what P really does to my brain I considered myself a serious addict and started to take action.I found out that many of my personality problems were only due to P..problems such as lower confidence,Anxiety,severe Brainfog,weak physique,etc .I've been through a lot of embarrasing moments in my life because of these symptoms.I always wanted to be an alpha...dreamt of it every time...worked for it everytime...but I couldnt be because of those side effects.

Hence the last couple of months has been like a war..fighting and failing and the loop goes on.I went through a lot of emotional downs...giving up my fantasies and wanting to live in the reality.Now everytime I fuck up I feel more guilty and shitty because now I know whats Exactly happening to my brain and that I'm still not able to take a concious decision when the heat goes up.

Whats done is done...and it cant be undone.We dont have control over our past...but we can influence the future by choosing our respnse in the present.The Only time we can control is NOW.

NoFap is fantastic don't get me wrong. However, I think that you can only go so far by solely not masturbating. Use NoFap as a start, and combine it with other extremely beneficial things such as cold showers &amp; exercise and the benefits should take you even further.

It has been a roller coaster so far, some easy days but also some very difficult hours. Last week I unsubscribed from all lewd subreddits and I avoid to click on sexy thumbnails on YouTube, obviously I also never visited a porn site since then.  This is what I noticed so far:

* I feel less tired throughout the day, meaning I can work better
* my body feels more energetic and I can feel stronger
* I am more aggressive, not in a violent or angry way, but in a way, where I **want** to accomplish stuff
* also I do push-ups and stretch exercises whenever I feel the urge

For now it's too early to notice any changes in social life, but my goal is to raise my self esteem and to think more positive about myself. Hopefully this will lead to a better interaction with women, as I am very lonely (though having a lot of friends) and I wish for a serious relationship.

\- No PMO

\- Will avoid looking at any explicit images

\- Dopamine Diet (No Social media / Entertainment / gaming etc. Only this Reddit Journal is allowed)

\- No fast food

**My Story:**

\- Age: 23

\- Have consumed pornography since age 13 ( before I could ejaculate)

\- Currently masturbate 2/3 times in one session every 2 to 3 days.

\- Hair thinning on top (sides are fine)

\- Low confidence/ self esteem

\- Lack of motivation to talk with women. (Never had a girlfriend.)

\- Social anxiety

**End goal:**

*My goal is to get a girlfriend and overcome the above.*

**Day 11 of 90:**

While yesterday I was super horny, today I was completely flatlined. No horniness, no anything. One thing I have noticed is that the rate at which the hair on top of my head is growing has increased just like my facial hair ( as mentioned before). I'm not sure if it's the fact that I haven't eaten any fast food since starting nofap or whether my body is recycling all the nutrients which I would have lost from ejaculation.

My biggest problem appears to be my insecurity in myself. I'm insecure about my masculinity. I think I don't look masculine enough. My voice isn't deep and feels kind of high and I'm only 5'9. This has been stopping me from approaching women my whole life. In fact the older I get the more ""normalised"" I become. I feel like I'm losing my personality and the charisma which I feel like I had before, when I was full of life.

The effect of my biggest problem is that it stops me from approaching women. I feel like nofap won't be able to force me to approach a woman...I wouldn't even know where to start. I'm going to have to really push myself outside my comfort zone. I really feel like I cannot afford to become like everyone else, no charisma, no individuality, full of conformity.

18949,Success Story,I finally hit day 90 - my advice,"After countless attempts I’ve finally hit 90 days and after attempting this for years I’ve finally found what works for me.

1 - Tell people:
The one thing with the biggest effect was telling my friends about the fact that I was on nofap.
While my male friends thought I was a bit odd (their loss) all my female friends were super supportive and impressed, additionally every time I was tempted after that I remembered their trust and resisted for their sake.

2 - Make a change:
Change a substantial part of yourself or your environment.
Is there a particular chair or bed you relapse in? Change it somehow.
Do you have long hair? Cut it.
Do you have a beard? Shave it.
Make a concrete change that splits wanker you from new you mentally.
Separating your new and old self helps break habits.

3 - Forget about nofap:
Immerse yourself in your study or work.
Find a hobby that really motivates you.
Don’t try and repress sexual thoughts, replace them with healthy thoughts to improve yourself.
Don’t sit and browse nofap for hours, go for a walk or cook a meal or something.
Reach the point in your life where not fapping feels natural.

It’s my 18th birthday in just over a month and I’m so happy I will be able to enter adulthood leaving my wankerhood in the past forever.

18964,Motivation,How to live a happy life - Guidance,"I am only 20 years old, but i've studied life for years now. I still have A long way to go but here's what I've learned.

&amp;#x200B;

It all has to do with the 'state' you are currently in. You don't specifically need a happy state, you just need a state where you are in THIS moment. This moment, you are reading this. I am typing this. This very moment is the only reality what exists; not tomorrow when you are going to do things, not yesterday when that guy said something about you,

&amp;#x200B;

**You can achieve this state by the following set of rules:**

• You HAVE to meditate every morning. Every evening. If you do this, after a couple weeks already you'll notice the differences.

• You DON'T, in any circumstance, watch porn. Nothing. 

• You need a tiny bit of routine in your day, or you will have no clue what to do every day. For example when you wake up you make your bed, take a cold shower, eat and drink something and begin your day fresh.

• You need a goal in life. That can be the perfect version of yourself, or an accomplishment,... Know what this is, may take some time. Achieving the goal, will take years.

• EVERY day, every single day, you do at least something to pursue that goal. It doesn't need to be hours, but at least something.

• You never lie. NEVER. You have no excuse. Lying is bad in so many ways, I think we can all agree on this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some quotes**

• To understand what reality is, you have to become reality; This means in order for you to understand what life and reality is, you have to be in this exact moment, and you'll understand it without having to think about it.

• Reality is happiness minus expectations; Having expectations about everything, is what's killing your happiness. You need to start living without having any expectation about your day. And be in this moment, I cant stress this enough.

&amp;#x200B;

**Inspirational people**

• Alan Watts - Philosopher (this guy's IQ was over 9000)

• Koi Fresco - Spiritual philosopher

• Terence McKenna - Philosopher (Hippie-style, but also extremely smart)

• Joe Rogan - Normal guy with a decent talkshow, interesting because of the people he talks with. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Interesting topics**

If you have no clue what you find interesting, and feel like there's absolutely zero purpose in your life

• Science is always a great option. You can't deny science thats the best part.

• Spirituality - if you have a feeling you want to explore more than this materialistic world

• Sports - Working out, jogging, swimming; It's all super healthy for your biological body and mind.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have many more rules that I try to follow, these were only some. If you guys are really into this, I could make this **a lot** bigger. But at this moment I don't think many of you are interested in a random guy's perspective on life. Let me know what you think.  Also i know a lot more YouTubers which are very interesting. Just tell me what you guys want to know.

If I look at a girl that I think is attractive I dont get hard but I get horny which probably dosent make sense. I dont get wet dreams (I should probably add I havent had any wet dreams since my dick worked) and when I do have a dream of having sex I have an orgasm in the dream and wake up but I never cum. Also the only part of my dick that works still is the head of my penis but theres bumps on the top of my head that I havent had before (im a virgin btw) and when i rub it it burns or just feels really uncomfortable and dosent feel good at all. My frenulum (the loose skin on the back of the head of my penis) is pretty much the only place that feels like anything. I also noticed I dont have any sensations in my shaft and im starting to loose the ability to get hard when rubbing my dick and if it does get hard its a soft erection. I’ve also suddenly lost the ability to cum and if I do cum barely anything comes out and I basically have to squeeze the cum out (which still only makes a little bit come out). I started masturbating when I think I was 13 and i remember it feeling so good like amazingly good and I felt guilty af after I did it. I do it almost every night before I go to sleep or even when I’m showering just because im naked so I might as well (also sometimes day) now just out of boredom or because i have nothing else to do or just because I wanna get an orgasm (yeah I know I probably just answered my own question) and when I watch porn i dont get aroused/turned on. Also I literally just noticed that my dick kinda twitches (i cant explain in better words) like its trying to get hard but it cant. I know the answer is to just stop fapping but its so addicting and I cant stop. I just wanna know what happened to me and advice on how to fix it. Did I break my penis? Help, please.

Because of NoFap I made it to 1 Million Subs!,"So I joined this subreddit 1.5 years back(with a different account that i dont want to disclose,its the same name as my channel and i am a little insecure about that), but I am so grateful to you guys. I started off with nofap an year back but it was not like a clean run I had a lot of rough patches but out of the 365 days I would have gone around 300 without fapping.

  
Nofap was not just the only thing but it was definitely the one that started everything, i started to look and critique the things i did, i started to learn new things , try out new stuff, create discipline in my life.   
I will be honest I failed in most and i still am failing but every-time things get better and I learn a lot.   
I was a very insecure guy who didnt even speak, pretty much a geek who had negative friends. 

I worked on it and changed everything step by step , from small conversations with strangers to speaking in front of class to doing stage shows to literally performing in the biggest auditorium in asia. I also started a youtube channel which is about technology and earlier i used to think that because i am a geek i dont get girls but after starting the channel about tech stuff and showing my interest in it openly and showing publicly that i do spend most of my time doing tech stuff and i dont have a social life and i am still very happy, people find it cool and i never though girls would be interested in this kind of stuff! I am making more money than i ever imagined , a lot of brands have partnered with us and I have built up a team of people working on the channel, website and other handles! Right now I am 23 but when ever i meet people who were friends with me when i was 19-20 they are baffled by the amount of change that has happened.

Today I made it to 1 m subs on my youtube channel and I wanted to thank you guys for initiating the process! I dont think this is a destination but its a journey that will go on just like no fap. you cant just not fap for 100 days or 365 days, it becomes a part of your lifestyle and it allows you to do better things and initiates a lot of positivity.

I hope you guys achieve great success and all i would say is just take one step at a time, its all that it takes! Instead of opening instagram which will lead to browsing pics of girls to videos to porn,just get up take a walk and do something that would actually create a positive impact in your life. I would say plan it before hand, because if you dont have anything than it gets a lot harder!

NoFap has been a big part of who I am and It will stay for the rest of my life!

19042,Relapse Report,Update - Being on and off,"Hello guys, 

Here is an update of my journey and **some thoughts on relapsing.**

&amp;#x200B;

I was on my 2 week mark last year, but I relapsed and did it last day of 2018 and first day of 2019. Since then I´ve been on and off on porn and masturbation and here are some thoughts about it:

* If you relapse:  
\- Accept it.  
\- Remember that you´re not bad. What you did is bad for you but you aren´t a bad person for fapping.   
\- You just failed, don´t punish your self for it.   
\- Read about the damages of fapping. Remembering how bad it is will help you.  

* Dates shouldn't matter too much, if its December 31th or 1st of January, what matters is starting again.  

* After a relapse. Once you do it once you´ll feel the urges to do it again and again and again, but that's your body asking you for easy dopamine. Don´t do it!! If you do so you´ll be hurting yourself. Remember that the repetition of these acts will be bad for the health as it will be rewiring your mind for easy dopamine.  

* Start over: Start again and analyze which are the situations that made you fall into the trap again. Analyze it and recognize them. Next time you will know  if you´re in one of them.  

* As soon as you feel the urges ---&gt; Distract yourself from those thoughts, stop them. You can tell your mind what to do in case you forgot it, so STOP those urging ideas. Literally move out of the room. Go and do something else

19195,Telling my Story,Just had sex (with an escort) after 12 days of nofap to test my deathgrip,"  1. It was great after just 12 days, I was using nofap to cure my death grip. Just 3 weeks ago I tried to have sex and I could barely get hard and couldn't cum or feel any sensitivity from a bj or sex and would go soft when the condom was on. After 12 days I can't say I'm cured but it is on the way, I could only get about 90% hard this time but felt enough sensitivity to cum, also felt sensitivity when getting a bj which wasn't the case the last time so imagine how it will feel if I make it 2bor 3 months.

 

  

  2. Honestly I didn't even do nofap right, I edged pretty much every day and browsed porn on Twitter and literally I have never thought about sex more and wanted to do the freakiest shit. But when I get home I'm deleting all the porn off my laptop and am never beating off again, I felt like a man after feeling like a eunuch knowing I couldn't pleasure a woman.











  3. Another thing I noticed was I went for seconds and couldn't, for some reason on the second attempt I reverted back to my death grip so I ended up fapping and cumming on her while she licked on me, I don't think that counts as a relapse tho.... so maybe I need to take it slowly and not rush back into since I clearly still have a ways to go.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ags3rv/just_had_sex_with_an_escort_after_12_days_of/

19250,Question to NoFap,New to this - 30(m) - married..,"On Day 4 here of no PM (not trying no O as married and we both need the release!) 

Never spent hours watching porn but since 15 or so have likely watched for 5 mins a day, usually to M and help sleep. Can’t remember going more than 1 day without PM in years...

That being said, given it was daily I feel it was starting to affect my sex life/drive and given my wife and I both have high sex drives (despite having 2 little ones under 3 which makes it challenging!), didn’t want to get into Porn ED territory. 

Not too difficult so far (not sure how some of you guys do “hard mode”!) but wondering if anyone else in a relationship still gets the benefits from no PM? 

So far on day 4 have already had sex more than normal during that period (3 times) so I feel that no PM is helping on that front...

Also feel slightly more alert but that might be a placebo effect I guess.

19325,Relapse Report,10 days streak gone - I don't have any outlets,"Went to the gym after work for the first time ever after not going in for about 3 weeks. I struggled with motivation when I got home after work so I figured it would be a good idea to just go straight to workout after. And of course I overdid it. My muscles are shaking and I felt like throwing up afterwards. I got home just feeling so tired and defeated. I've been having bad urges every day for the past 4 days and I relapsed when I got home. To clarify, it's only M&amp;O, I've never had an issue with quitting porn, but it seems like from the years when I did watch porn, the images fuel fantasies in my mind.

I just feel like I'm on auto pilot when it happens. And afterwards everything feels so empty. But knowing the pain it causes, I do it anyways. I can't stop, and I don't know why. 

Then I realized as well, I don't have any outlets for my sexual drive. I can't have a girlfriend without the goal of eventually getting married, (religious reasons) can't have a fwb, and it's just not a good idea at my age to get married. (Monetary and mental health issues)

What am I honestly supposed to do? At 21 I'm at my peak sexual performance and I never seem to be able to make it past 10 days.

I just feel lost in life. Nothing feels right. After high school everything has just been a blur. Maybe go here and do this, give this a try, etc. But I literally have no drive to live. I do the things I do because I know of nothing else. It's hard to be motivated in life when my religion says that this world is going to end soon and be replaced by a better world. I fear everyday that I won't make it, I have constant guilt about my thoughts and feelings. I feel disgusted in myself. I don't know what to believe.

19335,Telling my Story,I’m back at it,"2018 was a great year for me until the end of it. I started nofap December of 2017 while staying in the shadow of this subreddit, never posted or supported anyone with kind words, and I’m disappointed in that. Last year was very successful for me thanks to nofap. It led me on the right path. I deleted all social media, focused on my health very particularly, made my relationships better and created new ones.  I lost 55 pounds of fat (220 Lbs. to 165 Lbs.). While keeping my muscle. Lots of good things happened, lots. Can’t even describe how good life was. Then November came, and I found out I had Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. I was in total shock. I’ve never been an super unhealthy person, ever. I was only overweight because I was bulking for muscle, nothing bad health wise. I almost immediately started chemo after I was diagnosed. It was tough to give in to doing chemo because of all the negative things I’ve seen it do to people I’ve been close to and I over thought about how it would effect me mentally. I relapsed like I had never even started nofap... it’s like that whole year is gone. I’ve gained 18 pounds within a month and a half. I’ve kept my strength physically but I’ve lost it mentally.  I feel weak, like my power was never there. I’m heading for my 5th round of chemo this friday and I’ve decided it’s time to stop feeling sorry for myself.     
Nofap was the entrance to the life I started in 2018 and I’m very grateful for everything I gained from practicing it. I’ve seen how good of a community this is and how it is treated like a family. I’m ready to recover and fight these next six months of chemo. I’m going to get back on the path I was following no matter how difficult, and I’m here to support and help anyone who is ready to start their journey or is having troubles in their journey.

Well, all these things are starting to influence my music tastes. Up until now, I've listened to a bunch of Hip Hop with whack lyrics. I love the beats, don't get me wrong, but a lot of it just isn't sending me the messages I need. (No diss on Hip-Hop, just a diss on whack lyrics ;)

So I've been pursuing music that motivate me. Music that make me feel better, that isn't oversexualized and remind me that I'm on the right path. Here are some lyrics I wanted to share with you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

""Transform, reciprocate your mental state  
Now make a date to overtake your objective  
Show that through light, that everything is connected  
But not in categories, that's the Devil's story  
Symbols of cannibalism, ruin your vision  
The thoughts formulate in your mind with no precision  
So reenact, a rebirth, now you're the Phoenix  
When shorties see it, now that's the time they believe it  
Achieve it, your goals in life, don't be a casualty  
Infinite and intricate, monument""

19501,Question to NoFap,"Fitness, Rage and Nofap","Hey guys. Last time I had a real good stretch of no fap was in October with 28 days. Record is 43. Past two months I have been doing this outrageous workout program “Insanity”. As a result I’ve shaved off about 20 lbs and put on some muscle to boot. I gotta tell you guys...

Fat cells contain the enzyme aromatase which converts testosterone into estrogen.  Therefore, with lower body fat you have higher testosterone. 

I’m on day 4, I wanna punch a hole in a wall and I feel like a bomb ready to be set off.  Something pissed me off today and when I walked the dog I had ideations of smashing in car and storefront windows. I would never, but I’ve had problems with explosive anger/aggression with no fap before but not at this intensity this early. For those who feel aggressive on no fap, I’ve got day 17 aggression and it hasn’t even been a week. I’m scared and don’t know what to do other than to exercise like hell to tire myself out. How do I channel and refine this wonderful masculine energy to communicate productively with other people? I don’t want to come across as sharp tongued or rough around the edges.

19557,New to NoFap,I’ve always told myself I wanted to stop but I never really believed it.,"I’ve lurked here for some time but never posted and actually made this account a few days ago. About a year ago I told myself “Alright this is the last one before I give it up for good. Just one more to get it out of my system!” I have told myself the same lie probably weekly since then and caught myself in the lie again about an hour ago. 

I’ve wanted to stop for so much of the 8 years I’ve been addicted to this, but I never really believed I wanted to stop. Ever since that one day I discovered porn when I was 11, my life slowly started going downhill physically, mentally, and emotionally. 

Tonight I had a breakthrough of sorts. I forgave myself. Not for lying to myself or even cursing myself by giving into this addiction daily, but for hating myself for so long. For not having the respect for myself I should have and not believing in myself that I am better than this. That I’m not the problem but that there is a problem within me. 

It’s late and I wrote a lot and don’t expect many people to even see this much less read it all but tonight I’ve been inspired to stop feeling sorry for myself and to stop hating myself when in reality I need to hate PMO. I have to hate the addiction not the natural drive I’ve been instilled with that I squander down the drain daily. 

This is a public statement from a random account on the Internet that people may not even necessarily see. Regardless I’m getting it out there. I promise to myself, God, and the greater forces of the Internet that I will actually begin this journey of self-correction and self-betterment for real and stop lying to myself. 

Notice I’m not saying I won’t mess up because I’ve tried that before and that didn’t work. I’m vowing that every day I will progress in some way. Everyday I’ll work to make myself 1% better than I was the day before that. “Inch by inch.” I am taking the first step in the opposite way I’ve been walking to start this journey in the right direction.

Brothers and sisters I’m looking forward to beginning this journey with y’all. ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/agv7k4/ive_always_told_myself_i_wanted_to_stop_but_i/

First few days we didn’t talk as much, but then as she walked into class one day she smiled and said “Hey James how are ya?” And we just talked and talked, after class she gave me her Snapchat, and I felt invincible, considering I’m super shy and I grew up with anxiety problems. On the bus ride home I felt victorious and anxious, saying “this is probably too good to be true, but imma just enjoy the moment.” Anyways, the next English class I was surprised, we talked and talked again, we’ve been having deep conversations and such. Same thing with the next class, we’ve been talking and talking. After that class I told myself “time to break out of my bubble, imma take a chance on this girl, if she rejects me it’s alright, there’s plenty of other fish in the sea.” So today, I put on some cologne, shaved, and made myself a little nicer than usual. After English I said “Hold up Kaitlyn” and she smiled and said “what’s up?” And then, as my heart was beating like a timebomb, I took a deep breath and said “We’ve been talking for quite a while now, and to be honest I really like you, wanna go out and see a movie Friday night?” And to my surprise, she blushed, smiled and said “I’d love to.” Even though I’ve only been at it for 9 days, I was in awe, once I got home, I ran up to my room, and yelled “FUCK YES!!!”

19582,Confession,I found my problem,"I found the underlying cause of my fapping addiction, ironically after masturbating.

My problem with PMO comes from a long time ago. I noticed I have never let my emotions out and that makes me want to get ""comprehended"" by someone (in this case porn).

All this time I had been thinking PMO was the problem but now I know I have the responsibility of all this porn addiction.

So what I discovered was really helpful to me, because I can now fix my emotional problem, which is deeper than I thought, by so may years of not letting me project my emotions.

Unfortunately the only way I could notice it was by reflexing after looking at porn and losing my 23 day streak, but I think this may be the beginning of a life full of gratefulness, joy and happiness for people who surround me and for myself

19595,New to NoFap,Questions regarding the streak.,"Hello my Brothers/Sisters,

As a newbie here, I have a few potentially autistic questions about the rules of the nofap streak:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Does the streak also have to be reset due to fapping to orgasm **without** pornographic materiall? 

For example if we fap using the higher powers of imagination or fap as a form of fornication with a significant other.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Is reaching orgasm through getting it on with a prostitute considered a reason to reset a streak?

&amp;#x200B;

3) Is using a sex doll considered unlawful as well? 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if any of these questions sounded retarded to you hardened veterans of nofap, no pun intended at all.

Even if I'm new here, I can agree that porn is an abomination, truly the ""new drug"" that future generations will regard with more malice that we regard cigarettes or cocaine, one which has claimed more lives than we give credit for. I have let this disgusting heresy slowly hijack my dopamine over the last four wasteful years, its just too fucking much at this point. 

All of you are truly one of the few most phenomenally supportive and positive communities that could grace Reddit. You guys are just so fucking awesome. I couldn't have found this at a better time.

She understands my situation, and she was once my keyholder, and I gave up my chastity to her to help me with this nofap journey.

However, she broke up the D/s relationship with me on 15th January 2019, because she is now legally married. On that day, I was allowed to jerk off one last time under her feet.

I can barely walk and I feel super tired. Now, my mistress and I are taking a break, not meeting each others until February. But we can still be friends. Without any fwb relationship nor kissing stuff, only BDSM hookups sometimes after February.

Actually I am really depressed. I am so get used to have someone control over me, caring about me and my dick! And now I have no one.

19629,Question to NoFap,Placebo effect,"As a fapstronaut once majored in Psychology, I am struggling and need your help to overcome the fact that a lot of celebratory type posts within our group carry the heavy odor of placebo effect atop some, only natural, community hype-mongering that, the support we graciously receive from each other is for the most part, purely anecdotal and questionably unscientific.   


I don't say this to be controversial but only to be as real as possible, as someone who shares a problem with this community and is after a proven outcome. I do believe that self-stimulation is self-simulation and that by over-masturbating we remove ourselves from goal-oriented realities, hijacking our own chemical reward systems into a state of detachment and isolation. This is why we NEED this community to re-adhere ourselves, and this is what I'm more basically looking for or requesting:

Are there ANY formal studies that document populations like ours, before, after and during an masturbatorily abstentious state, as tested against different degrees of control group, i.e. ordinary uninformed men and women, maybe those merely suggested to reduce, and perhaps even a group who masturbate a large number of times but otherwise have no issues or obvious guilt about their own behavior.

I just think that it's time for us fapstonauts to be true scientists because it wasn't hype and helium that put a man on the moon.  I want to see this become a supportive and widely accepted community, solid of credentials and community science.  I want this community to work for everybody here. Everybody.

I have been wanting to stop doing “it” for several months now, but after seeing everyone’s progress, I am more motivated than ever now. Before, I thought it was just kind of petty and didn’t see a point in quitting, but after reading the symptoms of depression some of you guys have described getting rid of mostly due to NoFap, I have realized that I have a lot of these symptoms. It’s hard to explain. Like, I don’t necessarily feel depressed, but I definitely feel different. Not like I used to. One night recently, I just broke down crying because I felt lonely. My family helped me get through that initial part, but I decided once I stopped crying that I would do something about this. At first, I didn’t even think that fapping would have any correlation to my improvement. Actually since then, I would do it probably twice a day. After each time, I remember I just sat there, feeling bad about what I had just done. It was only today though, that I connected the dots. So, while I don’t necessarily feel depressed, I want to quit before it gets really bad. I may be posting on this sub a lot because you guys are the only people that really “get it”.

I didn't click on it, but I guess just seeing the title gave my brain an idea to have a little PMO in my own dream—and it nearly drove me to tears.

In the dream, I decided to fap and went on a porn site. I released almost immediately, and felt no pleasure whatsoever—only massive regret. I started freaking out and saying to myself ""why the fuck did I do this? It's going to take me at least two weeks to get to confident and non-shy self again!"" And then I remembered that I signed up for these classes for my hobbies that I'd feel very shy to attend now, and that I'm playing this elaborate multi-day joke on this hot girl and now I won't feel confident enough to deliver that joke to the punchline. I got so upset that I nearly started crying and then... I woke up!

It took me about a minute to reassure myself that it was just a nightmare and that I did not actually relapse and everything was fine. I grew up with abusive parents and despite being in my 30s now, I still on occasion get nightmares that I'm back in my childhood home. When I wake up from those nightmares, I'm so distressed, I have to get my cat with me in my bed and I bury my face in her and stroke her to calm myself down—she's like my support animal. Well, this night I had to get her as well, I was so distressed about PMOing in my dream.

The problem with porn is that we often do it quickly and focus on our pure enjoyment, in my case I would browse for long but finish quick. Because of that, you brain become automated to finish quickly in order to get to that good sensation. I am saying this because I have been having issues on lasting long with my GF. The sex is good but I just get this urge to finish and get my reward. The most fucked up part is that when I use to masturbate I would most of the time finish whenever the girl is about to come so now i have the same issue since my brain is programmed that way. Whenever she is about to finish, my brain kicks in and wants to finish also. I think the ED part is pretty common and everybody is aware of that. Your usual level of excitement is much higher because you watch so much porn so even when you see a real body, you might be excited but not enough from the perspective from your brain since your level are much higher and dont respond to your fantasy.  All of this made me realize that I really need to reboot my brain and make him learn on how to like and enjoy sex with someone. For those reasons, I try to focus on different things about her and the little things too so my brain knows that those are the real and best things and not the fantasy that I had in mind from porn.

But today, i randomly fapped for no reason. I don't know  why i didnt control the urge but i just wanked like that. I didn't even have any porn tabs opened or any fantasizing thoughts at all. It is quite scary for me to say the least..

19796,Advice to NoFap,If it was easy everyone would do it.,"

I’m pretty sure you have heard of the quote from title a thousands time before. Everyone knows how difficult it is to do NoFap especially if you’re a beginner like me. One moment you’re so “motivated” and all and next thing you know you are edging and giving yourself excuses like “it’s just a peak I won’t j*rk off” or “I’ll just stop in 15 mins” or typical “my streak won’t end if I don’t touch myself”. We all know where these will lead to eventually. 
It takes real self-discipline and next level commitment. It all comes down to how much you are willing to sacrifice. How badly do you want to achieve? We all say these things about how we would love to have self-improvement, clear mind, more attractions and so on but are we really willing to pay the price? Heck, some of us has already experienced the benefits ourselves yet we keep falling to same trap over and over again and back to square one. Is it really worth it? The guilt that comes with PMO by doing it even though you clearly knows it is fking bad. If you hate PMO so much then why do you still do it? 
Ask yourself these questions. 

Some advices:
Don’t be a fking beta. 
Become alpha as fk. 
Be the extraordinary.
Walk on your highest path. 
Be the noblest you can be. 
Be aware of the true purpose in life.
Do what others say i’s impossible to do.
Gain full control of your own main and strengthen it.
WAKE THE FK UP. STOP BEING STUCK IN ENDLESS LOOP OF RELAPSE. BREAK FREE FROM PMO CHAIN. BREAK FREE BECAUSE YOU DESERVE FREEDOM.

19834,Question to NoFap,How does these drugs use affect your PMO addiction?,"I'm 44 days in. However my life consists of regular partying on weekends and that mostly involves substance abuse with it. Can we please talk about how these substances effect the recovery process? Considering the participation in these substances is a purely social intent and is not a addictive dependance.  

Ciggrettee/juul smoking (once a couple of days, addictive stimulant, nicotine - dopamine) 

Alcohol (weekly parties, Depressant)

Marijuana (biweekly, Depressant)

MDMA (once a term i.e. 3 months, humungus dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine rush, withdrawal follows temporary depression - very vulnerable to PMO relapse to cope) my last use was during my PMO addicted cycle and my temporary depression lasts 2 weeks compared to 1 day of the people who I did it with. 

LSD/magic mushrooms (once a term i.e. 3 months, psychedelic, medically correlated to helping against addition due to its ability to block serotonin receptors for the long duration of the trip) Every time after my trip, my brain doesnt even want to think about porn, juuling/smoking, addictively play video games or even watch netflix - I believe it hints how my involvement with all those activities is purely hormonal dependance rather than any productive explanation. However, gym, reading, and work become a priority.

I've seen plenty of advice on the topic, but the majority of it leans towards getting out of the house or talking to people, which isn't feasible or practical after like 9pm on a weekday. It's too early to just sleep. The gym I have access to closes around that time too. One of my main hobbies is making music, but that's also not practical at night in an apartment building. Books/TV shows don't hold my attention if compulsions are strong enough, and usually the second I stop reading/watching I feel just as dead as before starting. But what else is there to do?

19892,Confession,Forgive Yourself !,"Done with Day 2 . Easy day...spent it with my friends. 
I have been addicted to violent porn for many years,degrading and objectifying women.When I started Nofap,having mastrubated to those rape fantasies made me guilty and scared that what if someday I hurt women in the reality.Thoughts like 'would I really like to rape women?' conquered me.I couldnt answer that after mastrubating to rape porn all these years. 
Then I slowly started realising that this is not me.It was all because of porn.I didnt start my habit by watching Abusive categories.It was due to the resistance I created for normal porn which made me choose the violent ones.And so far I havent hurt any human being sexually...I even get scared,not angry,whenever I think a girl becomes uncomfortable with me and I respect that and I dont even get the smallest intention of doing anything against her will... so I felt it was wrong of me to be scared about all those thoughts and the right thing to do is forgive myself and keep going.
So it is very essential to first forgive yourself,for your past, to move on.If you are not on your side then why should anyone else be.

19900,New to NoFap,The first try to stop my addiction!,"Ok here it goes: I am 22yo geography-student who has a massive problem to get shit done!

Although there are lots of nice people in my university i keep them on distance for reasons I can´t even explain to myself.

Whenever I am in university (which I attend unregulary)  I just count the hours until I can get home, read, watch netflix &amp; (of course) masturbate. I have trouble getting out of bed, learning or even call back friends who asking me if I wanna do something. In fact, more often than not I just don´t answer their calls/messages...

 Down below my apartment is a baker, with a cute girl, who seems to be really into me but i can´t get myself to make any moves on her. Whenever I get to a pint , at least somewhat challenging or difficult I don´t even try to overcome it, but go back home and watch porn. ""Why even bother.."", I tell myself

This has been going on like this for the past 4 months (well, my pornaddiction started with 12, but its been 4 months since I moved to a new city to attend university).

Then, last week, I stopped masturbating for 3 days. I didn´t know about this Community or the #NoFap movement in general (I can´t even explain why I stopped exactly), but the change in my life was tremendous! I started learning for my exams, reconnecting with friends, heck, I even exercised!

Everything was going great! I felt like, finally i could be on part with the pace my life is proceeding.

Then I relapsed..... everything back to normal.

It took me  about 4 days to make the connection that not fapping bettered my life. I always considered myself normal. ""Everybody jerks off 1-2 times a day, you´re totally fine"", I said to myself.

Well, although it is true that the majority of man(!)kind shares our addiction (I believe), it doesn´t lessen the negative effects on our Life.

Thankfully, I found this subreddit just today and I am baffled by the positivity and support you guys give each other!

I am glad that I can be part of this community.

Now I gonna start again! I am really eager to stop masturbating, but I know this path won´t be easy.

19937,Advice to NoFap,Stop gritting your teeth through NF! Here's my method.,"After relapsing so much in many areas of discipline, I've devised a slower method or approach to this problem. Before reading, I'll let you know:

a) I'm not a professional, and this is mostly untested as of yet (I'm preparing this method as I write this post, will be testing it afterwards). b) This will resonate better if you're like me, that is, very addicted, very undisciplined in other areas, and single. You might get something out of it either way though, especially if you adjust it to your own specific needs. c) This is really slow, thus the danger of relapse is decreased in one way with gentle habituation, and increased in another way with the danger of indulgence, so beware. d) The main goal of this method is complete abstinence from Porn and Fantasizing, not necessarily (this is up to you) from Masturbation and/or Sex.

**\[2 STEPS TO NO FAP\]**

**STEP 1 (BASIC RELAPSE PREVENTION)**

I noticed that when I relapse, it's usually because I'm very stressed, bored or horny, of course. There needs to be prevention in order for these feelings not to overtake you. Let's talk about stress and boredom first.

**GENERAL STRESS:** Firstly, regarding stress, we need a minimum of discipline in our lives. Focus first on 4 things: Sleeping as early as possible, Eating healthy, Exercising if possible (see a doctor first), and above all: Meditating at least 10 min a day (but aim at 30 min). If you skip this, three things will happen: 1) you'll get too stressed, then you might relapse, 2) your capability of finishing NF is diminished since your discipline capability itself is too low, 3) if you're already so undisciplined, then relapsing will not be as important as it is in theme with how you do things. Discipline is like a muscle, and if yours is too weak, you can take it slowly, but these 4 habits you need to have a bit of a sense of urgency. Not something you can dilly-dally for too long. You can take it easier with other habits. This will cover stress from before you start NF, the stress aftwerwards (NF related) is addressed in the next step.. In any case, if you got this basic discipline covered or mostly covered, you have already done a lot! Your cravings will most likely diminish as well. (Though don't worry too much about them, they pass without being acquiesced to). Now you can move along and do something to prevent the bored part (You can do the bored part along with the stress 1 part, just don't let it take your focus from the stress prevention, it's more important.)

**BOREDOM:** Meditation will help with not being bored that easily, but you need something to do (besides work) that gives you joy. Don't allow your day to be so empty and lazy. Find new hobbies and activities. You need to get to a place when you can forget you're doing NF. You'll have to learn how to be with boredom eventually, but first you need to focus on other things, avoiding boredom which will lead to relapse. You'll probably have loads to do, since you probably neglect some to many tasks. Try not to get overwhelmed, and try not to do too much quickly, or else you'll have too little to keep you occupied as the discipline settles in.

Obviously, though, even after you address stress and boredom with discipline like this, they still will not be entirely eliminated at all. You need to be on the lookout for tense moments and feelings arising and adjust you behavior accordingly. Have at least a general idea of what might work when you are at peak stress, peak boredom. And know that differents things might work at different times.

Regardless, these two things will lay the groundwork on your path to NF, and just a more fulfilling life in general.

\[A word of warning: Be careful of 'addiction replacement', try to avoid it if you can. Know that while some addictions are less harmful than others, they still cause you some stress. If you have a life-threatening addiction, then don't even bother with NF rn, take care of that first. (But I hope everyone's aware of that)\]

**STEP 2 (THE DIVIDE AND CONQUER METHOD)**

I had this inspiration yesterday. I was just watching Porn for a while, then felt the urge to Masturbate, but didn't. Then it got to me: Porn is kinda boring without Masturbation. It is *very* titillating with it, we all know it. But without it, without orgasming, it is like watching a movie that is too raunchy for it's own good. It gets embarassing just sitting there watching people have sex. I figured maybe, *maybe*, we can focus on taking the power of Porn first. So here are the 'sub-steps' in this method. These are cumulative, that is, you can't do step 1 after a while, then quit to start 2, or anything. It goes 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, etc.

**1- Separate Porn from Masturbation, Orgasm**

If you have no actual addiction to Porn, you can skip this step. Those that are addicted or close, then you have likely acquired a taste for just the Porn watching itself. Well, let's watch it for a while, with restraints. You may watch Porn for less than an hour (ideally less than 30 minutes) a day. You may also watch other titillating material. You may not touch yourself not only while watching, *and also* not even the same day. Get a calendar on your computer (a physical one might make someone question you), and mark Porn watching days with one color, and Masturbating/Orgasming days with another color. **Warnings:** **1)** If you orgasm easily, just by watching, then you should just write porn right out. If you feel you can handle just masturbating well, then continue, otherwise you can follow this step, you just need to switch from Porn to something else that is titillating but not explicit. Whatever *doesn't* get you off. **2)** This is temporary, don't spend too much type on this step. When you feel you can do without it without much upheaval, and that your viewing is decreasing, by all means move forward. Being not as stressed + keeping yourself busy + taking Masturbation out of the equation should make it decrease. If it's getting worse, try meditating more, focus on being more at ease. If it still doesn't work, skip it, go to n. 2.

**2-** **Separate Masturbating from Porn fantasies and images**

This is the other half of the previous step in a way. Not only has Porn been associated with Masturbating and Orgasming in your brain, but also while Masturbating without Porn, you might have frequent Porn fantasies. You have restrained and dissociated Porn, for now let's allow Masturbating and regular Fantasizing as well. (Regular Fantasizing means something new that you create in your brain, not what you have seen in Porn). You might see a gradual diminishing of urges to Masturbate as you go If it increases, it's probably stress or boredom; you must take care of that to avoid an altogether relapse.

**3- Separate Masturbating from all Fantasizing**

The truth is: Fantasizing too much is not only a waste of time, it might lead you to relapse to unrestrained Porn, and very importantly, it leads you away from reality. The main goal of all this is freedom from the fake world of sexual gratification we live in. Now, you are only allowed to Masturbate while focusing on the sensation, not tripping out on elaborate fantasies.

**4-** **Avoid Porn**

After watching Porn so many times and leaving unsatisfied, it won't be as hard to give up this boring activity. You already don't need it for sexual gratification anyway.

**5-** **Avoid all titillating material**

You *can* watch movies, and TV shows, YouTube, gaming, etc. Just try to avoid material that is too titillating. Forget about watching or seeing anything that could be labeled 'sexy'. There is so much else to enjoy.

**6-** **Avoid Masturbation**

This is where you'll likely have more difficulty. If you are single, you are going to be without sexual gratification for a while. But this is when you'll have not only a chance, but a certitude of reaching a point where you'll finally start living in the real world. It is up to you to be aware of yourself and see if you have reached that point and can go back to Masturbation or not. I highly encourage to not go back to neither Porn, nor Masturbating/Orgasming nor Fantasizing. But *especially* not Porn and Fantasizing. It is quite easy it is to fall off the wagon monumentally regardless of how long it has been.

This is the end of the method.

*Regarding counters*, I recommend them, as you can see you are gaining something every day. However, you might end up with 6 counters. Decide for yourself if you are or aren't overwhelmed by that. I easily get overwhelmed, for those that do also, a tip would be to start a counter at step 1, another at step 2 and so on. That way you'll still get that tiny sense of accomplishment while still on the first steps, but it will be less confusing and it will seem less excessive. Or you can just start at Step 6, since that is the culmination of the previous steps.

*Regarding relapses,* count them as well! You can and should try not to, but if you do, don't worry. Just try to understand what happen, and after lesson learned, forgive yourself, and move on. Don't be so downtrodden, no one said this was easy. Realize that every day you were 'on the wagon' has meaning and helps you on this journey. As to your counter, you can start over from the latest step you were in or just continue. See for yourself which is better for your morale, and how many and what kind of relapses you tolerate if you do tolerate them.

**\[A TALK ON NF MAINTENANCE OBSTACLES\]**

Yes, methods for disciplines are fine and dandy on paper (or screen), but we need to well aware of the obstacles we will face. I'll only discuss the nature of these NF obstacles. The actual solution to these obstacles is in following the above correctly.

**NF STRESS:** What is NF stress? This is a type of a stress that arises when you start NF, because of the pain of habituating, and it adds to your general/otherwise stress. This is why you must take care of your general stress levels first. You may even consider going to therapy, if you have it real bad. If you don't address your general stress levels first, then the NF stress will have you near despair.

The main problem I've had with NF is: it's too much, all at once. When you are addicted one day and abstinent the other, you have no time to adjust to it. This will raise your stress levels to the roof, then you might come crashing down into your addiction back again. This is why my method is slower.

**SEX/PMO DRIVE:** The lack of habituation is a big problem, now add to that a high sex drive, or more often than that, a high PMO drive! Let me start by saying this is something that meditation will help with. Not that you will have zero sex drive, but it will be a calmer sex drive. Nervous sex drive is what is dangerous. You don't care much about the consequences when you have that.

You'll likely never get rid of the sex urge (nor most would want to anyway), but you can and should greatly diminish your PMO drive (or at least your P drive). While you still haven't, this will greatly contribute to relapses, more than lack of habituation oftentimes. We have hopefully learned now we don't need to go about this gritting our teeth.

**CONCLUSION**

I have been attempting to become disciplined for a little over 10 years (that's right). Like Thomas Edison said, I have not failed, I just discovered many ways that don't work, and trying non-essential disciplines when you don't got the basic ones covered is a big one. The other main one is: quitting cold turkey/expecting huge changes to happen easily, almost overnight. So this is what these two steps were all about. Other lessons learned are sprinkled throughout this post.

The main philosophy of this method is that letting go is easier if you have something to fall back on, and you are not as attached. A silly analogy, but quitting PMO like this would be like breaking up with someone you don't love anymore, instead of forcing yourself to stay away from someone you actually see much value in. The goal is taking power and focus away from PMO little by little.

I'm open to all kinds of suggestions and constructive criticisms. Overall, I really, really hope, at least another person will be helped with this. Because I already feel more inspired, motivated and very importantly, calmer regarding my ability to reboot. I'm starting it right away, and will post results when I have them. Once I reach Step 2, though, I won't be active then because I'll be focusing my attention elsewhere.

I credit the tip of not focusing on NF too strongly to johnotcena, who credits someone else still in his thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/8rw7hn/most\_of\_yall\_doing\_this\_wrongly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/8rw7hn/most_of_yall_doing_this_wrongly/)

The most important thing lately has been the large distance to my triggers. I actually have to remind and warn myself of them existing. I don't think about porn or excite myself because I know it is not real. This way I do not only teach myself discipline and patience but also save time and thought for other real things in life.

I've experienced a lot while trying to quit PMO even before finding this community, but I feel like NoFap helps me analyze my journey and progress.

But the strange thing this time is that I'm not saying this from a high. When I was high on nofap I was feeling the sexual energy and thinking how I won't fap because I'll use the energy for building bonds with women or to put into my work.

Keep pushing if you’re still on your streak. Relapses have no purpose except to make you feel like sh*t and go back to your unhealthy habits. I learned this the hard way and don’t want you to be stepping in the same paths as me. Get back up and keep trying again, the only person that can change your life if yourself.

20057,Journal Check-In,I Feel Like A Dog Chasing Cars.,"Well, in December, I relapsed a couple of times after losing a 71 day streak. Since then I've had a couple of two week streaks, and I've been working on getting everything back together, but it's been tough. It's been rough all of 2019, actually.

In the past month, I've been talking to a girl. I don't know if she likes me. I sort of had a thing for her, we hung out once, and I didn't make a move for personal reasons. We were supposed to hang out again (an all-day thing) this week, but things ended up happening and we had to reschedule for a second time. When we rescheduled things the first time, I was disappointed and stressed about it, but I had some hope. Finally, when we were supposed to hang out the second time, I confirmed things with her two days before, and she ended up canceling on me again the night before. 

This is where things sort of begin to get strange, and I begin to notice things about myself. Yes, I was disappointed and frustrated. I never like to put all of my eggs in one basket, but this felt like it was gonna be something good, and I let myself get my hopes up. It's not often that I find someone that could legitimately develop into something, so I began to run with it.

When I confirmed things with her and it looked like we were all set, I immediately became nervous and anxious for the next day until disappointingly, I had my hopes crushed. I had a gut feeling that she was going to cancel on me, and of course she did. Despite this, as I was thinking about everything the day before, I began to question why I cared so much. Why did I really want this? DO I EVEN WANT THIS? It got me thinking about that line that the Joker says in The Dark Knight: ""I'm like a dog chasing cars, I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.""

It reality is...I don't know what to do when I finally get things that I really want. I put in all of this effort and stress and worry, and then by the time I get something that I thought I wanted, it doesn't even matter any more. I don't even like the chase. It's stressful and disappointing. I know that the dating game is not something that most people consistently win at. Even those ""players"" who seem to constantly be hooking up with others, or getting a new girlfriend every week are constantly rejected and disappointed, but they carry on without getting discouraged. 

Perhaps I've hyped up all of this in my head. In fact, I know that to be the case.

20061,Telling my Story,Certain kinds of pornography are ruining my life. Anyone else having this problem?,"So here's the deal: I'm an artist, an animator to be precise. Cartoons and animated movies are what have inspired me most in life.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a teenager I used to have a pretty bad porn addiction but got out of it by abstaining from it and was successful with this approach for years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my early 20s now and I slipped back into it because the work I do. If you have ever heard of newgrounds you probably know how most of the best independent animators nowerdays are making all kinds of gross media. it's either gross-out humor kind of stuff, or, you guessed it, porn.

So recently, when I got the courage to follow amazing animators I know from youtube for inspiration and guidance, I quickly came to find their pornographic stuff. And that quickly lead me down an awful path.

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning I was confident I could tolerate it, because if you've abstained for a long time and developed a more healthy relationship to your sexuality, your tolerance for it is higher. But indulging in this world has quickly dealt a devastating blow to my psyche.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an artist because I love beauty. I'm an artist because I love the characters and stories that are told with it. I don't understand why someone would dedicate their life to become an artist just to take a huge dump on it. Why would you take a character you like and actively put them in these absolutely disgusting situations?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it's not entirely true that I don't know the reason. There's a lot of money in it. And it's easy content to make because you always know what you wanna show. But it cannot be healthy. I can't believe these people aren't paying personal price for it.

&amp;#x200B;

But regardless, the fact that they are amazing at their craft and insanely successful is ultimately what is giving me the most dread. I admire them on one hand but deeply resent them on the other hand. Every time I come across work of theirs, even if it's cencored, is making me angry. Incredibly angry. And full of dread. This cognitive dissonance is tearing me apart.

&amp;#x200B;

I have gotten better now that I'm completely abstaining from porn again and also cut myself off from exposing myself to these peers. But now that I have a grave reminder of the existence of all the smut that is taking a shit on things I hold dear on a very deep level, it's making me angry on the surface and incredibly sad beneath. My personal well being has suffered as a result and it definitely has soured my enjoyment of my work as well.

&amp;#x200B;

i hope by abstaining from all kinds of pornography over time will get me back on track. If you've read this, thanks for taking the time. I'm sure reading your thoughts on it will help too!

20065,Motivation,Reminder: Give back to the communities who have helped you.,"I think most of us here understand that it would not be fair to simply receive help from somebody and not offer to help them out as well. However, in a community such as this, or any other community that helps with addiction, that concept is significantly more important.

Probably the most important thing about helping others get over the same struggles you are trying to free yourself from, is that you are actually helping yourself out as well. The more you guide people through tough situations, the more you yourself learn how to navigate your own struggles.
Here are some suggestions on how to give back to this community while helping yourself:

1: If you ever feel inclined to succumb to your urges, instead come to here and talk others through their issues. It will get your mind off of your urges and like I said earlier, it will help you navigate your own issues
2: Sort by new. I see many peoples pleas for help and motivation go unanswered. Ever single person who legitimately wants help deserves help here. There are hundreds of new messages here every hour that need to be tended to. Sorting only by top or hot will only bring you to posts which already have had their pleas tended to.
3: Take time with your messages. be willing to initiate a discussion with the poster to give them the best possible advice. Many recovering addicts feel worthless due to their addiction until they are pretty much recovered. By taking the time to really listen to your fellow fapstronauts, it will make them feel like they are worth something, and you will feel like you are worth something knowing you just helped somebody in such a big time of need.

All in all, this is an absolutely wonderful community. We all understand that we are all in the same boat here. Hopefully this post will only improve this community and bring it together even more",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ah3366/reminder_give_back_to_the_communities_who_have/

20299,New to NoFap,Time To Take My Stand,"I’m 22 years old, been masturbating over 10 years now, been stuck with and trying to get rid of porn for a long time as well, while also spending as long as I can remember dealing with a video game addiction.

Masturbation started for me as simply a pleasurable activity.  As I got older, learning about sex and being raised a Christian, sex wouldn’t be a part of my life until I was married, and I saw masturbation as “the closest thing to sex” and merely a harmless way to satisfy these new urges.

I spent a lot of time masturbating without any particular purpose behind it (“in innocence,” if you will) before I happened on porn.  I was introduced through YouTube (back when I remember being excited that a second Annoying Orange video was released, to give you a sense of timing).  A lot of famous Youtubers’ comments section had pornographic avatars, which stirred up a curiosity.  I didn’t think it was full-blown porn back then, and I justified my guilty conscience by saying that it was “natural” to have these urges and want to see MORE.  

When I discovered that the two went hand-in-hand and began to feed my ever-growing curiosity, it all went to hell.  My gnawing curiosity snowballed into a ravenous hunger, and my innocent pastime became a constant source of guilt, anxiety, paranoia, and self-loathing.

I do take solice in the fact though that I’m nowhere NEAR as deep as some other stories I’ve read:
I HATE these disgusting practices with a fiery passion.
I want them GONE from me.
Porn makes me feel disgusted and sick to my stomach, as does every time I masturbate.  They don’t bring me happiness any more.  
My conscience isn’t dead either, nor am I COMPLETELY desensitized, and my heart’s not deviated too far from where I want it to: when I do cave, I refuse to watch ANY porn that goes deeper than simply sex between a man and woman, and porn doesn’t fully satisfy my sexual urges anymore.  I long for a healthy emotional and physical relationship.  My brain refuses to let go of the good part of me that still views women with respect, and my sexual instincts are in the right place and relatively untainted.

I’ve finally reached a point in my life where I feel I’m ready to enter a committed relationship, and there’s someone I am interested in to that end.  I don’t want this to cast a shadow over a potential relationship, and the undeniable effects on your sexual performance that these practices have is something I DON’T want to bring to the table.

While in the past, I’ve always let the depression and anxiety beat me down and keep me from summoning the strength to BEAT this stupid problem ONCE and for all, I’m determined to overcome this and WIN. 
 I’m TIRED of the self-doubt, anxiety and depression.  
I’m TIRED of guilt gnawing at the back of my skull and anxiety clawing at my brain.
I’m TIRED of the effect it’s having on my mind and body.
And I’m TIRED of feeling DIRTY all the time.

I’m ready to reset, remold, and improve my mind and personality.

The longest PMO-free streak I’ve consciously kept track of is 13 days.

No video games, pornography, or masturbation.

20560,Motivation,The key to life and happiness,"Hey guys thanks for being apart of this community and proud of everyone for all the positive changes everyone is trying to make. 

To anyone out there who is really struggling in any way, whether that’s with depression, anxiety, relationally, financially, everything, this post is for you if you’re seeking answers.

First of all, there is a big flaw in the premise of attaching our confidence and self belief to the streak that we have or to how many days of no fap we’re on. The reason being, if we relapse we let that be our excuse to go back to living a negative life. The streak is a good measure but it shouldn’t be the measure of your happiness. 

I understand that there’s a lot of people who have a lot of guilt and shame surrounding their sexual expression of all sorts, and that’s okay that you feel that way, but it’s never as bad as we “think” it is, and guilt/shame is never productive to our growth, no matter how guilty or shameful you feel about whatever you’ve done. No matter what you’re experiencing right now, you and only you are responsible for charging up your negative situation based on the the incessant negative thoughts you keep telling yourself about your situation. 

You may even be at the point where you’re losing everything in your life, and sometimes that’s what it takes for us to wake up to the truth of the universe, and as hard as that pill is to swallow, you can rebuild even from nothing, even when you have incessant suicidal thoughts you’re closer than ever to happiness.  

You’re never too old, or too young, too broken, too depressed, or too whatever to make a change. However, the most important lesson and the key is to be happy NOW. Or to soothe your pain NOW. The best way to soothe your suffering is to stop your negative thoughts. (Its impossible to think positively or be hopeful or anything in the momentum of the negative thoughts or in severe depression or anxiety) so the best thing you can do is stop it. Here are some natural techniques to stop the thoughts of you are in need of immediate relief that prescription medication cannot give you in the moment. 

1. Take 20 conscious breathes through the nose and let your awareness be on your stomach rising up and down with each breathe. Repeat for as long as you need to to feel relief. This will work if you give this your full attention. 

2. Take a shower. Water helps soothe. Take a warm shower while listening to your favorite music, and then turn it cold at the end and feel the cold and try your best not to judge the feeling.

3. Journal, just write it all out how you feel. Be vulnerable with yourself. It will soothe you. 

4. You know yourself better than anyone else so trust that if you want to soothe yourself you can find a way. 

5. Just keep repeating the steps as much as you need to. 

Once you stop the train of negative thoughts, you can then be more solution orientated and move momentum the other direction, you can do more positive things to help you feel better. And just keep feeling better until you can say truthfully that you’re happy.

Now what you have done is attained happiness in the present moment, which shows you it’s possible to be happy, and since you got it now it  is the only moment there is. So if you can just hold on to that feeling, and extend it longer and longer, you can create a new reality for yourself. 

That’s the real streak we should be keeping our eye on is how satisfied and full and how many  happy days we can have in our lives because that’s really all we want, is to be happy now, not in the future but now. 

And some of you might say how can I be happy when all of this and that is happening? It’s easier said than done to come to the realization that you can be happy in the present moment regardless of what’s happening, but in reality, unless you’re in a complete fight or flight scenario, your present moment, what you can see, feel, hear, taste, touch, there’s not much to be unhappy about. It’s only in our thoughts that our unhappiness lives. 

Our identification with pmo being bad and feeling good when it’s good is just another thing we allow ourselves to beat us up or to build us up with. You’re the only one giving what you’re doing meaning and you’re the one holding guilt over yourself for whatever you’ve done. 

Forgive yourself and let go of the thoughts. It’s easier said than done because we’re addicted to those thoughts of guilt and shame because we’ve created those neural pathways that trigger those emotions our negative body craves, but just like how you have the strength to overcome your pmo addiction even for a day, you have the same strength to overcome all resistant and negative thoughts. 

Your true identity is that you’re a spiritual being, and you’re perfect. You’re the awareness and the consciousness behind your thoughts and emotions. It is in the judgment of ourselves that this unworthiness, or unloveableness lives, we’re comparing ourselves to others and we’re comparing ourselves to a standard we think of what is good for ourselves. Drop that. Drop everything you think you know and just be. 

Defeating porn is defeating a hard addiction to beat, but the biggest addiction to conquer is the addiction to the thinking that is causing harmful emotions to ourselves, keeping us in a stressed out and unhappy state. That’s the actual root of the issue, our lack of self awareness to our own thoughts and emotions. The thing is nobody else is living your life and only you know what you’re thinking and feeling. So if you’re thinking and feeling is bad, and if it’s bad for a long time then you’re addicted to thinking and feeling bad.

Your goal should you choose to accept is to slay that dragon of your negative thoughts, and it is possible you’re completely unaware of your negative thoughts because your conscious awareness is not at a level where there’s enough space for you to see. But if you’re reading this your inner self will resonate with this at some level and spark up a light inside of you.

Set your new goal to be thinking and feeling good. Stop the momentum first of the bad by any means necessary then start on the worthwhile journey of happiness. 

There is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. The journey should be happy leading you to more happy. There is such a path. And if you’re not on it, find it, because it exists. If you seek you will find. ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ah7j9l/the_key_to_life_and_happiness/

20569,Telling my Story,My 120 days No-fap journey - Help me - AMA (18 Jan 2019 - 18 May 2019),"**To make sure if I understand what NoFap is:**

No-fap is the deliberate abstinence from the cycle of porn-masturbation (colloquially fap) -orgasm (or PMO). The main reason behind the no-fap movement is to rewire the brain to stop seeking the [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) high from the PMO. Due to the [Coolidge effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect), the brain gets used to the usual dopamine release from one single partner. However, with a new partner, the brain gets a new dopamine high. In the age of internet porn, the Coolidge effect takes a new form, where new virtual partners are only a click away. This affects the brain adversely and due to the nature of this addiction, few people talk about it. Thanks to the internet and forums like reddit, communicating about this issue is helping a lot of people *(which is what I am hoping in this post)*. 

**My personal case and why 120 days**

Personally, I've been in the PMO cycle since the onset of my puberty. It had never bothered me functionally in a society but lately I can feel the lack of drive to socially interact with people or even pursue a mate. From jerking off 3-4 times a day I am about to quit everything for 120 days. Why 120 days? Because for a lot of other people in the same subreddit or simir forums, it took the brain 90 to 120 days to reset itself in terms of dopamine craving. **If you find an actual scientific research paper supporting this claim please do so**. Seems very pseudoscientific but from what I know about neuroplasticity, it kind of makes sense. This is not my first attempt. I've tried NoFap at least four times in the past and my highest record is 19 days. However, this time I am confident that I will achieve my goal.

**What cums after**

Will I give into PMO after the whole ordeal? I might. I hate thinking in absolutes. The same way I will enjoy my occasional glass of wine or a peg of whiskey or two without abusing it. Even in terms of smoking I'd do it once or twice a year but smoking and drinking 3-4 times a day is a serious issue. I will indulge myself with some occasional self-pleasure just like everybody else but instead of internet porn, I will try maybe reading erotica, my own imagination or better yet, share the experience with an actual human being. One thing for sure, moderation will be key. But for the next 120 days, I will abstain the fuck out of everything.

# Day 1: 18th of January 2019 - 119 days 15 hours and 17 mins left

Doesn't feel so bad. I am feeling the occasional urge to jerk-off but I am keeping myself busy. In fact, in order to cope with it I have started this reddit post. I am very much aware of my past failures, but I am also aware of my past victories. In the past I used to have this extreme sugar addiction. I used to pour 4-5 table spoons of sugar in the morning coffee alone and I used to drink this concoction 3-4 times a day. Four years later, I drink maybe three or four cups of coffee per week with just a splash of cream. No sugar whatsoever. Never did cold turkey. I managed to cut back slowly, but with PMO, I feel that I have no other option. I will survive today for sure, but the next 3-4 days will be extremely jittery. I will keep you all posted.

**TL;DR:** Guy started 5th attempt nofap routine for 120 days. Talks about first day. Asks for the community to get enganged and help out.

Today I am grateful for having the chance to be a part of this small community. You guys give me hope and inspiration. Deep down I've always known how destructive high speed internet porn could be for me.. yet I got addicted to it.

From now on I will respect my Mind and Body because it's the only one I will ever get so I better make something good out of it.

20573,Telling my Story,Keep going it does help,"context: I fell in love with my best friend, a friend fell in love with her too, she had a thing for us both at the start she turned him down and she and I talked things through and decided to stay as best friends like always.

Then she tells me a few months later that she has been dating my friend for over 4 months or so. I already made my mind about it, I was expecting it, it was a matter of when. Before knowing I was happy, everything was good, after knowing it a few days later I started feeling jealous, overly conscious about it, and guilty because I wanted to support their relationship but I was having such thoughts, my denial ended up causing so much stress that I was nauseous for 3 weeks, because I somehow couldn't accept that I still had feelings for her in that way, until I basically cried for a while.

Sometimes it hits like a brick, I can be normal I see a photo of them going out and suddenly I feel sad. But what matters is that, my brain wired it to fapping, it's not like I used fapping to cope with the situation, but still if I fap one day then I will be overly conscious about the situation, would start over thinking things as to wether they went on a date or if they are fucking and such, 

tldr: my brain fucking hates me.

Its been some months already, I started feeling nauseous because of a driving photo, it wasn't as bad as the start, I went through the same medical check ups and then more and everything turned out fine... This is pure emotional stress and fapping became a catalyst to making things worse.

I'm just wondering if I'm able to pull through the 3 months my brain will reset, also to put my mind out of this weird thoughts, And no I haven't cut contact with her, as I choose to not go for it, he did and she chose him as simple as that, if I were to run from this I will be losing her and to make it worse, losing an irreplaceable friend not because I risked going for it but by doing nothing.

The only way for me to lose is if I don't pull through this situation and somehow nofap is helping me to do it. Dunno about superpowers or the like but as you might know the point of doing this is to change ones lifestyle heck started working out and I've felt much more relaxed and for MUCH more time, I'm not interested in looking for women or the like anyways even if I'm a virgin. I only feel something for a person if Im extremely close to the person, if not it wouldn't matter if she were a model I would just go ""oh she is pretty"", and forget I saw her. 

What I want is first I wanna leave a starting spot for this, I haven't been serious and I'm extremely fed up with this, and also motivate people to not break their streak, truly not fapping has its benefits specially if you do it regularly. In my case I stop feeling anxious and conscious about this situation, I feel like I'm truly making progress. 

It's hard, but you can do it. Hell I've been feeling extremely shitty lately but decided to release all that frustration in other ways, If I was truly serious about it maybe I would have gotten over it at this point who knows, but if you are here and this rambling helped you with your urges or to truly try it then that's enough for me.

20645,New to NoFap,1st attempt - 10 days,"I first reviewed the NoFap notion  in depth 10 days ago and decided to give it a go right away.
I definitely believe that porn consumption has incredibly bad consequences on one’s mental health,
but the idea of abstaining from masturbation altogether surprised me. Masturbation was always portrayed as an ok 
and natural thing to do, therefore seeing how many people praise the amazing results they achieve by denying themselves
this action seemed truly remarkable and I figured I’ve got nothing to lose and that I’ll give it a chance.

Obviously one has to avoid fapping for quite sometime to start noticing a difference as I’ve come to understand from my research.
So I didn’t expect to feel differently during these 10 days and the discomfort of quitting an enjoyable habit would shadow any 
sense of satisfaction or achievement.

This is my 10th day and I broke (no porn, just good old imagination). I am not too disappointed with myself, I did not expect to succeed on my first attempt 
especially when a lot of other commitments (university exams, running daily and avoiding sugar) drain my willpower.

I will give it another go and hopefully I will manage better. 

I do want to take this opportunity to consult you guys. I’m in a sexually active relationship. Giving up orgasm in sex seems like too fundamental,
too good of a privilege and a too integral part of life to give up. My question is - is it worth it ? Are the benefits so great? Isn’t refraining from porn and masturbation enough ? Is it fair toward the laddies?

20674,Victory,90 days!!,"After years and years of trying, I've finally bloody done it! 90 days done. How? Well to begin with I switched to a healthy diet which I believe helped no end. Once you introduce one good habit, others seem to follow. You start to feel healthy and as a result happier with yourself and want to make sure that continues and progresses into other areas of your life. 

What I would say is: 1. Never give up, you will succeed eventually. I've been trying to reach 90 days for about 6 years now and this is the first time I've ever succeeded. Persevere!
2. Try to find out what is causing you to fap and try to tackle it*. Often the cause of the addiction is rooted in some sort of inner sadness. I personally was suffering from a disease and taking lots of meds causing me to never feel healthy, which consequently made me quite miserable sometimes. I used fapping as an escape. Luckily, I found an online community which had treated the illness with diet. I switched to a healthy diet and my symptoms eventually disappeared, without the use of meds, (this was a long process, but well worth it!) Now I feel healthy and happy and want that to last. I won't let porn destroy this feeling of true wellbeing. 
*I realise this is a lot easier said than done. Try all you can.

You CAN do it, no matter how long it takes. You CAN! I am proof of that. After every relapse just keep buggering on. :)

Good luck people!

20692,Journal Check-In,"I am back, day 20, hard mode. The struggle is real.","Another year went by. My addition came back harder than before in 2018.

I kept going between this and pornfree, but I always feel better results when I do nofap hard mode.

I was at a rate of 3/4 relapses a week, with a few random ""multiple a day"" too.  Way too much for me.  
So I came back on reddit to try to fight another time. I forgot how hard this journey is.

I'm on day 20 hard mode. First full week was shit.  
Then I had morning woods for 3 or 4 days. A very weird wet dream too.   
Then they stopped and felt like a flatline. One day of the second week I had huge headache, but not sure if related, but never happened again.  
Day 14 or 15 IIRC was worst, was not alone but felt a physical urge and was basically fighting my body. Hands/arms were  shaking as the conscious me was trying to fight the urge.

After that I was just busy with friends/life and forgot about PMO really. A few days went through easily, I felt way better, full of energy, no shame, eyes way more open than before. Started to really notice it at the mirror.  

Until today, day 20, another huge urge. It may have lasted half an hour. it was incredible, but I didn't relapse.

My brain knows that every x days I have a day alone at home. I knew it, I was browsing like everyday but this time was triggered by some ""sexy""  pictures on the news and felt the urge, out of nowhere. It was hard, I was getting out of my head. Worst day until now, worse than the 15th.  


As soon as the urge went by I started planning other stuff to do that'll keep me busy for quite some days.

While this streak I started playing piano, the easy things, chords, easy scales, notes and music theory.  Not really sure I like it.

Then found a guitar around, put some new strings on it and picked back that too ( I already had basic lessons in past).I may drop the piano and just master guitar, since it's really what I like.

Now I am working on robotics too, building a few DIY  remote controlled (from the internet) robots from old electronics parts :-)

At a point I felt the peace in my brain. Total silence. It felt good, after years being rushed to watching porn on every free  moment... I feel I am more laid back. Wait, not in the mean that I'm not doing stuff, I feel more relaxed while doing lots of stuff. Less anxiety. But today's urge nearly caught me off guard.

All of this stuff could've done much earlier if I only wasn't losing all that time and energy fapping to a computer screen.    


I am aiming at least at the full month PMO free since I never reached that much on hard mode. I hope to reach at least 40 days. But really would like to reach like 6 months or more.

WE NEED HELP.
And ultimately this subreddit won't be able to provide this help for all of us.
If you have a bad conscience about not telling anybody of your loved ones or your friends, you should swallow your pride and realize the importance of getting help.
Just 7 days ago I was finally able to explain my fears of being addicted to my phone, porn and masturbation to my girlfriend. I didn't tell her how many times I have been relapsing or how I thought of  porn as a solution for all these years. I simply talked to her about being lonely, stressed and bored and what my go-to's were for a long time. I told her about possible reasons for that behavior like family issues and bullying and how that could have affected me to choose these things over the years.
A few days beforehand I did another important thing. I recorded a video of me talking into the camera about what I think would happen if I told my parents, friends and my girlfriend. At first I spoke about getting punished, being seen as a disgrace and left alone. But while I was speaking I realized that all these people would be upset if I didn't tell them. They would be sad if they would never know or their reaction had been expected to be as terrible as I thought.
The talk with my girlfriend opened up a new door and I would love to see that this insight can help you too.

20908,Telling my Story,A message to young men.,"For young people here, especially those in your teens.

I'm a guy. I have had 30-day streaks. They helped me clear my mind, and find more motivation, and even fight my neuroses. But even without NoFap, I have had the unfortunate privilege of being a natural misanthrope, giving me a certain perspective on life in general. I have realized that I've wasted so many years of my youth on a toxic mentality that gave me nothing.

I can remember my 17, and I can say that I was still a dumb, ignorant kid who hasn't discovered his true passions yet. I'm almost 30 and still feel the same.

I struggle every day, streaking or relapsing now and then, but that's not my main problem.

This is what you should avoid: cowardice. I was a damn coward in life. I never put a foot outside my comfort zone. I never actively tried to make friends. I was terrified of rejection. This led to a vicious cycle in which I was terrified of people, and blamed them, hated them for the fear I felt.

Laziness plays a role, too. No passion in school, no interest in a career, no people who might be interested in you as a friend. I hated people for this, the belief that no one would give me the time of day if I wasn't fitting societal expectations.

I don't know how it might benefit you personally, but NoFap alone wont solve your future problems. 

No girlfriend?

#No problem.

Girls and women complicate a man's life too much. You'd worry about pleasing them, buying stuff, dates, even - god forbid - the risk of children _when you dont want and cannot afford any._

Besides, you shouldn't just barge in peoples lives looking for happiness in other people, but you shouldn't expect it to happen without putting in any effort. I went to college expecting to find friends and happiness, but that was a self-delusion because passive life doesnt give anything.

Don't ne a jerk, don't be a creeper, don't expect girls to owe you affection, or even friendship. That's how you risk getting a creeper reputation and maybe even your own #MeToo victimaization from women if you screw up. If you happen to live without succeeding in winning friends or a relationship, it's not the end of your life. You owe it to yourself to achieve day to day satisfaction.

Not even happiness, because what is happiness but a momentary state of mind? Dont believe those jerks on Instagram who only post about happiness, gratitude, #blessed, or show off how lucky they are to be loved or whatever. People who present themselves like that come off as desperate to present themselves as such to escape/avoid any sense of negativity, and any possibility that it can end. And they end, all right. Maybe in divorce, maybe from neglect, maybe people just get bored and want to move elsewhere, etc. They lie to themselves.

Not to insult those attitudes, just that you have to take the bad with the good and not focus exclusively on good. Focusing only on good things is a toxic mentality that leads to impossibly held standards that you would always fall short of, and hate yourself for.

Live balanced. Don't expect anything from anybody. Live for your own health, your own self-improvement. Don't take shit, don't give shit. You're still so very young, so please save yourself grief.

Don't let the rest of your youth be wasted on the shit I talked about.",73,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahd5rt/a_message_to_young_men/

20946,Journal Check-In,I relepsed today and here's what I observed.,"This is an excerpt of my journal entry for today. It is a little long and I'm sorry for that but I have faith that it might help to read this for anyone who is struggling with escapism through pornography and masturbation.

TLDR : Porn will keep showing itself in my life as long as I keep escaping reality and inhibiting my own progress. It's always just a moment of weakness away. The only way for me to escape porn is to escape escapism itself. 

 I sat down with my laptop to put the movies I downloaded on my phone into it and then I browsed Reddit where I got myself into a porn subreddit which was an honest mistake. Then it started. This was the day that I brought porn and masturbation into 2019. I felt bad when it happened, that I destroyed this absolutely wonderful scheme where I was going to leave this destructive habit in 2018 and simply not let it get into 2019 with me. I watched some Reddit porn, went onto xvideos, watched some porn, masturbated once, and then twice to some crappy pornography. No porn is good porn, it's just the desperate mind which makes it up to be oh so sexy and oh so arousing. Then I realized that this was bound to happen. And it will keep happening. Porn is not the underlying reason why it's in my life. When I quit watching porn back in December I started focussing on working out and making progress with studies. I had a purpose, to study and prepare for the exams I was about to give. A few days ago I stopped studying because I had to study some complex topics which I never really understood and I'm also  under some  time  constraints to study them which adds to the pressure. I started spending almost all of my productive time escaping my reality and especially doing the actions which would lead to progress in my life. I ran from responsibility just because it was hard and there was resistance in my path. This escapism made me weak enough to be enticed by pornography. It wasn't as if in my pursuit of illegal downloads I hadn't been accidentally exposed to pornography before. I simply brushed it off back then and got back to the important things of my day. But this time I had a moment of weakness, and there's no escaping these moments, when you stop making progress towards a higher goal, these moments will be there to coax you into going backwards in life. I went back about 4 weeks, and could've happened at 20 weeks easily, or even at 52 weeks porn-free on 1st January 2020 now that I had a 2019 devoid of porn and I just miss it so, so much. Now I feel a little worn out and I'm going to underperform at the gym tomorrow just because I did what I did and I deserve all of it. I have quit again, I did it properly this time, in the store room where I masturbated for the first time. I put on a bad video where they make the girls do a lot of objectifying shit and I jacked off. I acknowledged that there is pleasure in this activity for me, but the pleasure I feel is short term and it will make me become worse as a human being and cause me a lot of grief in the long run, that this pleasure isn't worth it at the cost of my true happiness and fulfillment. When I was finally done and all cleaned up I felt happy for myself, the kind of happiness I felt when I quit smoking - largely self-induced. I just have to keep moving forward in life and this moment of weakness will never show up the way it did today. If it does show up again, because there are times when everyone becomes vulnerable, I'll just have to focus on doing something that is better for me than this. This is a psychological fight I have lost many times in the past. But I know what to do to win now. Just anything other than porn. I have known this all along and I've even done it many times, but I've been weak in those moments as well, giving up the ""charade"" and going back to degrading myself and all these people I saw in the videos. I still don't know what I'll do. But I'll just have to figure it out then. I have quit watching porn for life and I have made a conscious choice to also stop masturbating. I've been masturbating ever since I hadn't even started puberty. I don't want to do it anymore. This is my final departure from the world of PMO as the fapstronauts over at r/NoFap like to call it.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahdo79/i_relepsed_today_and_heres_what_i_observed/

21010,Journal Check-In,"NoFap for 66 days, flawless retention for 20... I’m miserable much of the time and am discouraged","I work and live at an art community space...

At one point I was living in a Silicon Valley tech community and I was insanely popular there, even when I fapped 3x per week. 

I feel like socially I keep failing over and over again. While the benefits of NoFap are obvious, I have a hard time observing my absolute social failure here, and have seen undeniable NoFap boosts in the past. 

I’ve experienced the insane attraction and charisma boosts, and have this expectation that it’ll come back at any point...

~

Most of the co-workers and community members have the opposite core values as me. 

To put it overly simple for the sake of brevity, it’s kind of a hedonism vs discipline thing. I’m one of the only people who value long term thinking, discipline, self improvement, etc. 

I’m also one of the few that values monogamy and long term relationships over polyamory and hooking up. 

~

Anyway, I do feel very strongly for now that I’m meant to be where I am and work at this organization. 

I’m on the fence of just studying charisma to ease my social experiences. In the past, I’ve been quite successful when I studied charisma... (listened to and studied the Art of Charm podcast) 

I just didn’t want to go this route because I thought it would be unauthentic, and I honestly thought my NoFap and retention would naturally boost me in this area to my satisfaction. 

If things don’t improve, I’ll most likely return to studying these charisma improvement methods...

~

Final note...

I have a good amount of body health issues and I wonder if the life force preserved by NoFap is simply going into imperceptible body healing.

Afterward I was instantly thought about how previously I would’ve drowned myself in a pool of overthinking before even approaching her. A few things have changed in my mindset I would like to share with you guys.

1. Girls are just humans. If you can talk to your mom, why not that girl?
2. The true mindset with girls should be that chasing them should not be your main focus. There are many more important things in life to worry about. With this mindset you will find more success with girls as you will not be afraid about failure with them, rather, just indifferent with the outcome.

\- No PMO

\- Will avoid looking at any explicit images

\- Dopamine Diet (No Social media / Entertainment / gaming etc. Only this Reddit Journal is allowed)

\- No fast food

**My Story:**

\- Age: 23

\- Have consumed pornography since age 13 ( before I could ejaculate)

\- Currently masturbate 2/3 times in one session every 2 to 3 days.

\- Hair thinning on top (sides are fine)

\- Low confidence/ self esteem

\- Lack of motivation to talk with women. (Never had a girlfriend.)

\- Social anxiety

**End goal:**

*My goal is to get a girlfriend and overcome the above.*

**Day 13 of 90:**

Another flat day today. Didn't feel horny at all. My subconscious was still trying to push anxiety and negative thoughts into my conscious mind but I was able to recognise and disarm. Whenever I am getting a negative thought or feeling I reverse it and compliment myself. Two weeks of no fast food takeaways has to be a record for me as I think I've been eating fast food multiple times a week for about 4 years. I think I am definitely improving internally. It will take time to change the wiring of my brain from negativity to optimism because I've spent my entire life being a pessimist. My brain is definitely not used to operating at dopamine levels this low.

Other changes I have definitely noticed is my hair is growing at a faster rate (on top) and also my nails. It's hard to differentiate whether this is due to not wasting half a litre of nutrients from ejaculation over the last 13 days or whether it's the improved diet. I also noticed that I am a lot calmer, I now take my time when doing ordinary things. I am able to relax even when travelling in extremely busy public transport.

While I had a low sex drive today and most of yesterday, last night I had a sudden spike in libido, I felt really horny to the point where hands were nearly trembling. I was able to overcome.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahf583/nofap_day_13_of_90_another_flat_day_hair_growth/
21064,Emergency - Help!,Dealing with performance anxiety,"Hey, first of all, my counter is set to when I started this and quit porn for good, but since then I still masturbated (once a week max) because I get very painful blue balls after a while.

I've had sex a few times since starting this and recently I'm seeing this girl and we had sex in 3 opportunities so far.

I think quitting porn and masturbating less has improved my libido, but sadly, it still haven't changed a great deal on performance issues.

I do have more frequent random boners, but when I'm with a girl there's still this thing blocking me from being aroused normally and performing well.

I feel aroused and get hard when we start to fool around, but when it gets to penetration I start getting soft and lose it. And it takes some other attempts for me to get semi hard and actually have sex. But it seems like every time is getting harder to make it work, because I feel more pressure and anxiety and I feel bad for the girl, even though she's comprehensive about it.

I feel like every attempt is exhausting for both of us, even when actual sex only lasts for a few minutes, and this is making me want to avoid sex.

I have normal blood tests and get rock hard erections by myself, so I'm certain the problem is in my head, so I wanna know if anyone got tips for this and if therapy is the way to go. Also if I should try a Psychologist first or go to a Psychotherapist for some anti-anxiety stuff.

21073,Success Story,365 days of NoFap Later... Accepted into Medical School!,"Hey NoFap,

*I thought I'd share the story of my NoFap journey with you. I am now sitting on 365 days and I am so glad to have reached this point. I've also included some takeaway tips too for you, the reader.*

Exactly 1 year ago, I was one day away from my MCAT exam. This exam is critical for medical school applications. I had just relapsed on the 17th, and my test was on the 19th. I was feeling terrible. Dejected. This wasn't my first time taking the exam. It was my 3rd. I had applied to medical school two years ago and didn't get accepted anywhere. This was probably my last chance to do well on this exam. If I didn't do well, I'd have to give up my dreams of becoming a doctor. Just having relapsed amplified my nervousness and also made me feel guilty for throwing off my focus.

I called my best friend, Cameron, and we talked about the upcoming test. I told him how shitty I felt for having relapsed the day before. I felt like I was wasting my energy on PMO when I could be studying and focusing for the biggest test of my life that I was about to take.

**Tip #1: Talk to your close friends about your NoFap journey. Even if they don't do NoFap, even if they don't understand why you'd want to do it, it will help you stay committed to being a man or woman of your word.** 

Cameron didn't understand why I'd want to do NoFap, but he commended me for my efforts. We joked about how crazy this journey is and it made me feel a lot better just to talk to someone about it.

The next day, I went in to my exam and wrecked it, scoring above the 96th percentile. 

I came home, and thought about celebrating finishing the exam by relapsing. I even fired up a video. But halfway through... I realized this is foolish. There's so many better things that I could be doing. In the springtime of my youth, why am I staring at pixels moving across a screen when I could be going out into the world and palpating its flesh with my own hands?

I thought about what was important to me. That being: Becoming a good physician. Raising a family. Being a loving (and interesting!) father and husband. I decided to fill in the time that I would have spent PMO'ing by pursuing, and developing, old hobbies. I got better at basketball. I improved my guitar-playing, learning new Bossa Nova songs.

**Tip #2: Remember what is important to you. What vision you are pursuing. Do it! Why not?!**

Next thing I know, I'm about a week in and I start to really feel the cravings. They were tough. At the time, I didn't know if I wanted to go a full year NoFap. I thought, ""Maybe just once a week and things will be okay!"" Here is when I discovered NoFap. I also have to thank my cat, who likes to chill in my room. Why would I masturbate in front of my cat? He probably thinks I am so foolish.

Joining the NoFap community was a life-changer. I lurked, lurked, and lurked for this whole year. I loved reading your stories of success, and vicariously felt the pain of those who had relapsed. The motivational quotes and images inspired me. I could feel something resonate within me. This community is full of like-minded men and women who all want to better themselves so that they can live the best lives they can. We are allied against the common enemy of our own individual selves, and our craven desires. Everyone is fighting their own battle, but we were helping each other out with that.

**Tip #3: Join a community! Read about the stories of your peers!**

Instead of opening up a new incognito tab and going to you-know-where, I'd open it up and go to /r/nofap. Soon it became a knee-jerk reaction to go to /r/nofap if I ever got urges.

Side-note:

Now I know all of you like to talk about ""superpowers"" and attracting women and whatnot. What has my own experience been?

I think NoFap makes you hungrier. Which is a good thing. You have more vigor to go and pursue the things you want, whether it is fitness or women. I shoot shots. I have stopped being timid in thinking about whether or not to ask a girl for her phone number.

I've learned that...

**Final Tip: Regret is much worse than rejection. Regret is much worse than failure! Shoot your shot!**

I'm excited to attend medical school this Fall and walk the path of my dream to become a physician. 

I wish all of you in this community the best. You can do it.

Love,

marimariposaposa

Daily yoga and some occasional weightlifting has helped me find some physical release when the cravings get bad, but honestly this sub has been a major source of motivation for me... just being able to see my streak on here and ask myself, ""do I really want to reset that?"" has helped me say no to masturbating and move on to better things.

21197,Telling my Story,Why I’m doing Fap Free 2019? A lil bit NSFW...,"I’ve got a girlfriend who I love and she happens to be a virgin. Being with her as a sex and porn addict has been the toughest thing on me. I’ve gone out and fucked other bitches while still dating her. She’s forgiven me twice for cheating and it made me realize how much she loves me. 

I’m on probation currently, but we still together. She wants me to work my shit out and see if she can take me back fully. I gots till February to show her that I want her back. I want to stay clean to a point only she could turn me on. She told me her pussy will only be mine and I should look forward to that day when she’s gon be giving it to me anytime I wanna. 

When I started thinking about that I realized that she can in fact turn me on. And the more I detox from porn consumption and masturbating, the more I can see my girlfriend in a healthy sexual way and preserve my semen for the lit sex we gon have together in future. 

Plus I’ve kinda bragged about my sexual stamina to her a lot. I wanna make sure I got that juice by the time I marry her. So this journey really means a lot to me. I wanna enjoy sex with my girlfriend, I want her to feel loved in those ways. I don’t want to be a nut case struggling with porn and side chics when I got a loving woman!  

I know getting there won’t be easy because I gotta fight my inner demons in relation to porn and sex addiction. I realized talking to her about my fucked up life and desires is one way to let her understand me at a deeper level. And it also brings me closer to her, because when we share our fantasies, we are building a healthy sexual chemistry together. 

These talks with her have opened up my heart and made me feel loved in a way that I didn’t feel before because I was always basking in shame and lying to her about my life. (Jerking off everyday and looking for bitches to fuck when the urge is too much) Sharing such things with her has made me happy of late and looking forward to hang out with her more. 

I’m going to meet her today for the first time this year. She confessed to me that our recent chats have made her so horny and she’s never felt that way with any other guy. I remember on one recent chat how she got me wet by telling me she wanted me to fly to her place and fuck the shit out of her and I ended up relapsing because I just couldn’t settle for the pre cum. 

I told her I ain’t gonna do that until I am clean and in control of my mind. Plus I want to know how to love her like I’ve never loved any other woman! Like she the only bitch in this world! I want the day I fuck her to be the best day of our lives. Probably during our honeymoon. 

Just felt like venting this out, sorry guys for fucking with your time.

I’ve done just about everything to make P extremely hard to reach or out of sight out of mind.  It has helped. But due to the changes my body is going through, by day 7-10 I’m desperate for any sort of dopamine as I feel like shit due to all the changes going on with my body. 

I feel that if I go out of my way to show my wife love and respect and create desire and affection and sex is the result, that’s fine.  Agree?   I feel very different after sex vs PMO.  (Sex would be like eating at a 5 star restaurant whereas PMO feels like a stale hamburger that’s been sitting out all day at a convenience store.)

But if I’m asking her to basically use her body for 3-4 minutes so I can O, and providing nothing in return, this seems like it’s just a thinly veiled MO.   Sometimes I just know when to ask, and sometimes I just annoy her to death until she submits. (I’m such a prince.)

Seriously, I'm so lacking in urges, that I can't be bothered to watch porn even if I wanted to. My penis feels like it's non-existent, except when it gets hard for no reason.

Except that I don't feel any kind of depression, which is weird since I've always read that the flatline is accompanied by depression, although I don't think I'm depressed.

21313,Relapse Report,I have goofed ladies and gentlemen.,"Today, on the 19th of January, I have officially relapsed. I am disappointed In myself, but even though I failed, I'm sort of happy, too. My longest streak before this year was 7-8 days, and since the 3rd of January I managed to run a reasonable 15 day streak. (Today would've been day 16)

Although this may not seem like that much of an achievement, that's double my best streak, so to me, that is a decent feat.

Expect more from me in the future however. My next goal is to last a minimum of one month, and if I can help it, a year. 

There are a few tips I have accumulated throughout my research and through Reddit posts that have helped me.

1. Going outside for walks and basking in nature is highly effective in stopping urges and forcing you to forget about pmo-ing at all.

2. Exercise will also release sexual energy and cause urges to dissipate.

3. If you are caught in a tough bind, exhale all the air from your body and hold your breath. This will put your body into panic mode and force your brain to think about survival as opposed to pleasure. (NOTE: This is mainly used for quick, powerful urges, in the long run however it is best to go out or exercise)

4. Cold showers help to build discipline and kill immediate urges, but they aren't magical. Although I do recommend them, they won't turn you into a stone faced God who bathes in light and purity whilst vanquishing evil from afar. (This statement doesn't apply to actual gods)

5. Whatever you do and whatever your circumstances, DO NOT BE LAZY AND AIT ON YOUR PHONE ALL DAY!!! It's ok to do this sometimes, but too much and you'll either be tempted into failure or be bored enough to do some crazy things. This a what killed me last time so be VERY careful. Try to be active or socialise with family or friends, as this forces you to be active.

In closing, I would like to wish all 'fapstronauts' not only luck, but strength and endurance to use in these troubling times. Although now I am feeling disappointed and plainly stupid, I will push on and continue fighting this addiction.

Sincerely,
Mack

21494,Journal Check-In,Feelings on Day 2,"After recently committing the vacuous move of relasping right before musical rehearsals a few days ago, I've been going through a labyrinth of wondering how I'm gonna pull through. I suppose an obvious objective would be to enhance my passion and ambition to become an overall better performer than I've been up to this point. 

On the other hand, my outlook on my appearance will definitely be something tangible enough to strive for. It's only the second day and my female friends sporadically decided to take candid pics of me when I was simply sitting down, for I 'looked like a bad boy model' in that moment. However, because my lack of exterior compliments disabled me from fully projecting confidence, I resulted in unawarely making awkward facial expressions to which my friends pointed out I was 'derping out' again. Nonetheless it followed with a hangout comprising of another compliment that went along the lines of 'you look happier' from a close friend. 

As proud as I am for making it this far without falling back into that binge hole, I can't help but feel so frustrated at my past mistakes of wasting so much potential on feeling and looking so much better than what I am now. I constantly grew up believing I was the black sheep of my family and that I was destined to be single, misunderstood and unattractive; but now, I only realize how much of the reason why I felt unhappy truly derived from my actions. I understand that's the point of the NoFap journey but I can ed extrapolate it's my internal ambition motivating me to become a much improved version of myself.

It is the most important factor of a pleasing personality.

It gives quality to the tone of voice and enables one to convey through the voice any feeling desired.

It serves, as nothing else can serve, to give motive-power to one’s desires.

It keeps the nervous system charged with the energy needed to carry on the work of maintaining the body.

It sharpens the imagination and enables one to create useful ideas.

It gives quickness and definiteness to one’s physical and mental movements.

It gives one persistence and perseverance in the pursuit of one’s major purpose in life.

It is a great antidote for all fear.

It gives one immunity against discouragement.

It helps to master laziness and procrastination.

It gives one physical and mental endurance while undergoing any form of opposition or defeat.

It gives one the fighting qualities necessary under all circumstances for self-defence.

In brief, it makes winners and not quitters!

21622,New to NoFap,Controlling the Ps,"A few weeks ago, I was reading through different sites on the harmful effects of prone masturbation - I had been doing it since I first started masturbating as young teenager. As I was browsing through those sites, I stumbled upon r/nofap and quickly read up on what the community was about.

I don't think that I'm an excessively heavy user of pornography, but, I hadn't realized to what extent porn could damage a person's long term well-being, and realized that my life needed change. One comment a nofap user wrote summarized the problem well. It said something along the lines of  ""if you can't even abstain from PMO for 1 week, that's probably a good sign of addiction.""

On that day, I resolved to do three things: (1) give up prone masturbation forever (I had read about the negative effects a while ago, but hadn't completely stopped doing it), (2) challenge myself to abstain from PMO for one week, and (3), ultimately gain control over my penis.

It's been about two weeks and, I can confidently say that I'm proud of what I've done. I haven't engaged in prone masturbation at all and am still resolved never to do it. As for the week long abstinence challenge, I ""relapsed"" on day 6, and masturbated for the next few days (without porn), but decided to start a new streak, with the goal of abstaining for two weeks.

The seemingly superhuman powers that certain users describe are not what I'm looking for. But I can definitely see how abstaining from, or at least greatly reducing, PMO can be beneficial in the sense that it frees up time and increases self-discipline. I can't say for sure what I want to do with this, but I'm going to try my best to finish the two week streak and then I'll see what happens from there.

21702,New to NoFap,Fapping vs Sex vs Age,"I have been following you for a while and I still cannot understand why fapping should be worst for you than sex.

I am a 40yo business man, divorced few years ago, and currently with a stunning 22yo girl, which also allow me to have sex with other girls in some special occasion. Of course we have a lot of sex, but I still like masturbating. Sometimes I selfishly masturbate 30min after having sex, even if I know that my gf would love another go.

Sure sometimes I take a half viagra before a big session, and sometimes masturbating prevents me from wanting to have sex, but I am very open with her and I simply tell her that that day I prefer to just watch some porn...

Recently I went on a business trip for a week and I tried not to masturbate at all (it was tough!!, I feel you guys!) and when I came back my gf gave me a fantastic night of sex. The day after I had sex with a different girl, VERY tight and I struggled really hard to last more than 5 minutes.  This was the first time in years that it happened to me and I did not enjoy it. After the first session I had lunch with this girl and she was ready to get some more sex, but I preferred her to leave and masturbate on my own...

Am I just not the right person for this sub? I remember when I was 15 to 25 and I know I was masturbating way too much, is no fap referring mostly to that age bracket?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahkhba/fapping_vs_sex_vs_age/
21705,Relapse Report,Day 18: reward relapse,"Context to date: not addicted to porn, don't like it, doesn't get me off, don't crave it, will never use it again and it's been quite some time since I have. Used it probably 4 times through 2018 with exponentially long breaks in between. It's just not what I need.

Started this current streak end of 2018 with it in mind I would do a 90 day challenge with exponentially long breaks in between ejaculation rewards. After the 90 days I was going to consider based on my experience in this experiment to see what the best time between ejaculations is to feel my best.

My goal is to return to an active sex life. I have not had sex since 2014 and I'm 30. I'm not happy with this situation and believe I've got to comfortable in it, so I'm doing nofap to break that comfort.

The first marker was 14 days, when I said I'd buy myself a stroker/masturbator to use on my reward days. 

In these 18 days I've taken 3 key wisdoms away:

- Speaking to [multiple] girls is key. If you've had a decent conversation with a girl you find attractive, you feel better about yourself. You need multiple girls to have good conversations with so that you can keep up that momentum when one is being less conversational.

- I 'need' a hug, not sex as much as I thought when I was a regular fapper. What I actually crave is female touch, that doesn't necessarily have to be sex.

- My hand isn't cutting it anymore, which is why I thought of the stroker, but by the time I got to 14 days I also considered the stroker useless too, as what I'm trying to achieve is better relationships with females and to escalate that into touch and so on into emotionally invested sex.

- I flatlined between day 14 and today believing I was pretty low on sex drive, getting nowhere with women still and generally unattractive. I missed the 4-10 period where I felt very sexual and authoritative, like the masculine edge/aggressiveness. I didn't feel completely depressed or unsexual... But I felt a bit undesirable and deflated.

- Tonight I got a bit fed up of this and seem to be making much process with this girl I'm beginning to like at work. I started letting myself fall into scarcity wondering if I'll ever be able to attract a girl again, then into deeper insecurities about dick size etc.

- I decided to cash in on my day 14 reward I'd missed. I did it in a bit of a strange way because I started edging with my hand thinking about body parts of this girl at work and largely her face and mannerisms... I knew my hand wasn't what I wanted so I ended up wrapping my dick in toilet paper, folded my pillow in half and fucked it (even mimicked the CAT). I started with my hands on it like it was her arse, then imagined myself over her in missionary as I held myself up got the hip action and grinding in like I was fucking her, imagining her under me seeing her face and hearing her moan. I'm not going to lie when I came it was up there as one of the best orgasms, my whole body went weak and I had to drop my weight literally like I'd just finished some good sex. I guess it was kind of worth it as long as I keep up my exponential challenge, it's shown how ejaculatory abstinence is useful for great orgasms when you do, as well as the other benefits during the abstinence.

- It's about 45 minutes after and my balls ache a bit.

- So, my next allowance for a reward will be when my (just reset) counter reaches 21 days. It's a longer challenge than last time, but only 3 days off where I got to this time. After that it'll be 30 days and so on. It will be interesting to see what the extra 3 days bring, possibility of not needing the reward next time.

It'll also be interested to see whether I get my 4-10 day 'masculine edge' as a consistent occurrence or whether it's psychosomatic.

No matter what happens, it's a daily quest for me to spend more time with females; increasingly touch them (not necessarily sexually, maybe just hugging friends or showing emotional connection like innocent touches on the shoulder etc) and then when there's a prospect it'll feel natural escalating that to more provocative touches like neck touching, hips, legs, arse, maybe even breast, like I was doing in my prime 5 years ago.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahkja4/day_18_reward_relapse/

21734,Advice to NoFap,Something that really helped me.,"My girlfriend an I made an arrangement that has really helped me stay clean. This requires you to have someone to confide in about your struggles that takes it seriously, but not necessarily a romantic partner, although it probably helps.

1. She makes me promise her everyday that I won't PMO.

That one is pretty common I guess.

2. She also makes me promise her that if I am about to relapse, I will text her beforehand.


The thing about the second promise is that she will not say or do anything to try to stop me from doing it. And that is the important part. I am released from the first promise the moment I tell her that I am about to relapse. But I have to tell her that I am going to PMO before I do it, and that is precisely what stops me every time.

3. The next day she asks me if I kept the first promise and enthusiastically cheers me and tells me that I make her proud.

This also helps of course, but the second step is the one that keeps me clean. ",155,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahku7b/something_that_really_helped_me/

So I’ve been porn free for more than one month now, maybe two, but since some weeks I’ve been waking up with super urges. Sometimes (but rarely) if I am somehow really awake I can control it, but most of the time I don’t really realize, and I remember about it only 30 minutes after I wake up in the morning. 
It’s starting to be very annoying. I am always able to control my urges during the day, but these one,  when I’m tired... I don’t know what to do guys. I guess it’s part of the process, so I wonder if you might know some advice/trick. I’ve already started taking cold showers, even putting cold water on my balls before going to bed.

I keep relapsing, The most I have gone is 3 days, I’m 22 years old and I have PMO for over 10 years so it’s not a good habit.

It’s not like PMO effected me a whole lot, it didn’t get in the way of daily activities and didn’t affect my personality much but when I was bored I used to PMO. 

Like before doing PMO I prioritise certain things such as health, business family, I try not to let bad habits control my life. 

I am wanting to improve myself as an individual and see how this works as I know watching porn isn’t realistic and it’s not a good way to learn more about women and adult life. 

Can anyone give me some advice

21802,Telling my Story,My Story!,"My journey with PMO began when I was exposed to porn at the age of 11. It seemed harmless at the time, but little did I know that daily exposure to porn was actually an addiction. A few months later, I was able to make myself orgasm and before you knew it, I was hooked to fapping to porn. I am writing this to remind myself why I will NEVER fall victim to PMO again. I’m done with it, for good.

The first few times I ejaculated was a euphoric and enjoyable experience. However, I soon noticed that I began to desensitise myself to porn. Things which would of blown my little mind now became normal, and I found myself watching more and more “unrealistic” sexual acts. Interestingly, each time I have relapsed after a long break, the ejaculation takes me back to that amazing first sensation I felt the first time I PMO’d. That is the addiction’s trick into reeling you back into the vicious cycle. 

As the porn addiction continued, depression, anxiety and a near complete loss of self esteem and confidence overtook my body. My teenage years were spent literally giving in to this addiction. It had become so routine that it felt like a normal part of every day life to fap on a daily basis.

Irrespective to my age; the times where I have been happy, confident and “alpha”, were the times where I could not fap for whatever reason or have abstained from it. But the demons of the addiction would always creep in and tell me, “how can fapping, such an innocent and natural activity cause depression and anxiety”. I began to believe that fapping was a relief to my depression. Do not be fooled. Fapping to escape from your feelings or to avoid problems is in fact an awful thing to do. The post-orgasm blues that occur following ejaculation, only further amplifies the problems you had in the first place.

The longer this addiction has gone on, the worse my depression has become. I was a virgin until 16, and only found a girlfriend when I stopped fapping. I am not ugly by any means and I would say I am attractive. Getting laid is very very easy for me, but as a teenager felt like the most incredible task due to simple human anatomy, girls tend to be sexually attracted to alpha males. Fapping in my experience would bring me closer to the beta spectrum. Depresssed, upset and frustrated. 

I only broke my initial fapping addiction after I was prescribed an anti depressant, which would inhibit my ability to ejaculate. At the time, I put down my new energy, motivation and “alphaness” to my anti depressant. Looking back, it is highly possible the fact I was able to find a girlfriend was due to the fact I stopped fapping.

Eventually I stopped taking the antidepressants, because I was very sad that I could not fap and was experiencing withdrawal symptoms from masturbation. I was beginning to suffer with erectile dysfunction at 16, and this is when I came across no fap. It became apparent that PMO was starting to stop me from having sex and this is when I began to stop fapping. My morning wood returned to me and I became an absolute beast in the bedroom. If there’s any motivation I can give to people to try NoFap, is that it does significantly improve your sexual performance.

One side effect of NoFap to me is, an increased sexual libido. This would seem like a bad thing, but couple my attractiveness with a new found feeling of being “alpha”, I ended up having sex with many women and experienced a couple of pregnancy scares. My high sex drive led me to developing a sex addiction, and I began to abuse sex as a form of escaping the same way I did fapping.

I was not content with being so promiscuous, and returned to fapping. I have done this because I KNOW that fapping will cause me to be a shell of myself - beta and therefore unlikely to have any desire to have sex. Which has been true I have been sex-free for two months. What has resulted has been quite extraordinary, my depression and anxiety had gone to an all time high and I have become extremely demotivated and unproductive; also side effects of PMO.

As a user of marijuana, it amplifies the dopamine rush of the orgasm, and the blissful feeling led me to be even greater dependent on PMO. The beauty in this was, it also amplified the extreme depression, anxiety and beta behaviour which occurs following PMO. And this was an eye-opener as it led to me realise, PMO has been the root of all my issues! I have now realised that I have been using it as a form of dealing with stress, not realising that fapping has indirectly caused many stressful events in my life. I have started NoFap again and the results are simply staggering. My energy is up, my anxiety has significantly diminished, my libido is rising again and I am more productive. To give an example, time I would have spent fapping to some porn is now being spent writing this on here, something I would have never had the motivation to do before. 

This isn’t a science, it’s all personal experience, but it works for me. You may experience some withdrawal symptoms to start with, but that is normal, stick to the process. Try to limit ejaculation solely to real sexual encounters, and you will see your quality of life truly improve.

Some benefits I receive from no fap:
- feel more alpha 
- lay 10x more girls (literally)
- improves social life
- improves mood
- more energy
- more productive
- improves memory and cognitive function
- reduces brain fog 
- improved erections and libido
- greater self esteem
- A deeper voice 
- I exit my comfort zone (no more fapping to turn to, I am forced to try new things) 

There are likely to be more but this is what I could recite from the top of my head. If you can relate to this, stop fapping and invest that energy into something productive. Your mind and body will thank you.

I was doing PMO for the past 5 years and deep indise my heart i knew that at points where I failed in ma life was because of this addiction. But still to overcome that depression or sadness again masturbated and the cycle went on. In this journey I met 2 girls and with both of them I kinda had physical thing(not sex). But the thing I noticed everytime was that before kiss and all.. I felt my dick erecting and just after kissing for couple of minutes or getting intimitated for some time.. It goes back to normal and I lost the drive. I no more want to kiss but just out of lust I kissed her. Today m all alone and when I recall those moments, I feel awkward and confused. Was masturbating regulary once or twice a day made me like that? Why I lost my drive suddenly just after a kiss? What would had happened if I got the chance to get laid? I guess I wouldn't be able to get it up😓😕.. Today m on 7th day of nofap.. And m having mood swings.. Please suggest guys why that happened and is it normal to have mood swings during this period?

- 90 days is pretty accurate. Al though I didn’t fully feel rebooted until around 110+ days 
 
- Porn really isn’t that bad. There’s other coping mechanisms that are worse in my opinion such as binge eating and drinking.

21819,Telling my Story,Approaching woman....But my situation is awkward. Wha you all think?,"Hello guys! This is actually my 1st post in reddit, I want to approach woman I encountered lately but I am really new in this regard and have no experience at all so I'd love to have some advice from you guys :) My story could be a long so I don't expect many people read it but it's a really fun, interesting and very awkward one, especially at the location happened, and I'd love to have you guys's support and advice for it. I really love this community so decided to ask you all. So, here are some basic info of mine before telling the story: (For TL;DR, please go to CURRENT SITUATION heading directly down there, which might still be a bit long lol, thanks)

# My Info

I am a 24 asian male, 5""11, 68kg, who graduated from uni 2 years ago, who has no single experience of dating, kissing, holding hands, sex or literally any intimate things done with female 1v1. (Yeah it is quite pathetic but I'm not gonna look back at it right now). I'd describe myself **fairly intelligent, was working in a big-named bank (Now I quitted it so I'm currently unemployed), but look really pale and skinny, am a 3/10, sunken cheeks and eyes, and shows no emotion most of the time, give resting bitch face, with bad health who coughs a lot**, probably because of **chronic fapping since 10, around once a day,** probably always giving a **bad vibe** to others (You know... that fapper/creeper vibe, especially when laughing). I also have several huge dreams (like investing to get rich so I can improve quality of life since I'm relatively poor) wanted to achieve. I always think I can achieve it because at **young age I was really good academically, intelligently and extremely popular, well-liked by literally everyone, girls treated me like a celeb walking by back then before fapping, I also was a at least 9/10** probably (from I was always told), but have been having no motivation and plans in this **decade** to back them up since started continuously fapping.

# Friends/Love Life

I think I did have few girls interested in me throughout uni life. And in this year after graduated a while, even several girls messaged me out of the blue on FaceBook to befriend with, even wanted to ask me out through an investment course ""excuse"" as I told them I love investment (Yes, because I don't look as bad as 3/10 in photo, maybe misinterpreted as a 5/10). But I have been so bad and oblivious of reading hints in real life and texts , and I was uninterested in anything except video games (Just got rid of it lately), generally physically and mentally tired in real life all the time, because of pmo. So I literally rejected all the offers from friends and girls. I also had few crushes at uni and but I did literally nothing and I really regret that. Now I have very few friends on hand. I can't really count, maybe 2-3 I can think of to get helped right away if I'm in serious troubles. But literally no female friends anymore. And yes, pmo could lead you to that.

# Lately Improvements

So lately, I started Nofap, have been failing on 1st few days, 9 days (currently having) is my longest streak. I decided to change my life in aspect of life. Including reading books (I've been doing it on and off before), cold shower (from you all :D), working out (got fitter body already), reading reddit for several self improvement threads. Ultimately, so I can live my best life and maybe possibly get a girl for companion (Yeah don't worry, I don't put them on a pedestal, you guys taught me that, I'll no doubt focus on my own life, which might also somehow attract girls in any way if lucky) But honestly, I also want a girl, coz after nofapping a while, you don't have pornstar with you anymore and you go back to real life, you tend to get bored without any romantic things going on, especially when I'm currently unemployed so most of the things I do is just self-improvement at home, which lacks human connection other than family.

Got to say thank you if you read this far, really appreciate it, so here's my story and current situation and I really need some help down there:

# Current situation

It's a situation which might lead to eventual approaching in the end.

So 2-3 days ago, there was a lady calling me on phone at around 12pm which I just started to sleep not long ago before that, because my sleeping schedule has been messy since 14 (Yeah I'll fix that later) and was sick. She was a human resources person, headhunting me for a job (I post my job profile online for finding jobs). Usually I received tons of headhunters' calls every day a lot from 9-6 which usually annoys me because I will be sleeping at that time usually and I already got a conditional job offer from a favourite job which mostly will have no problem (I don't like the job actually, but I have to go this way because I aim for the position after 5-10 years for career path). But Excepting this time, its straight from a bank's human resources but not headhunter. I was a bit shocked they directly found me (Seems I'm valued) but still a bit annoyed because it woke me up. Anyway, I tried to listen what she said, but I'm not especially interested in the job position and duties but I gotta admit she has a really nice, clear and soothing voice which kinda differentiates her from those usual headhunters' cold call. She was inviting me for an interview, I was like ""Well there is nothing to lose to go for an interview, especially for a guy like who has been lazy at finding new jobs, what's better than someone knocking me in the door and ask me for interviews?"" So I decided to give each other a chance and I accept the invitation which I will be going on the next day's morning. Meanwhile, I also compliment her voice out of the blue and said ""From your voice, I could tell you are really young."" She laughs at it and so did I, even though I don't know if she likes it or thinks its a harassment, but anyway. Yes sometimes, I could be tempted to accept invites by unknown headhunters if she has a good voice while not too aggressive to push for sales (They do it for referral fees, not sure for straight from banks tho) and show care of how my employment life going on and career aim and stuff like that. She also told me there will be a male line manager (That I'll be reporting to if landed the job) along with her in the interview.

On the interview day in morning, I got everything prepared but I was a bit sick so I have to tackle with my running nose, and I was almost late for interview (arrived 1 min before appointed time). When taking the lift to interview floor, I told myself not to be nervous because with nofap for 5 days (Which I have never done that before actually), my confidence quite skyrocketed at that time even I was sick. So I call her extension with a phone out there of their office. She came out, My initial reaction in the brain was like ""OH SHIT! That was an attractive lady!! That's a legit at least 8/10"" (Yes I shouldn't grade females from 1-10 but I wanna let you all know how she looks like). I was immediately attracted to her more than the job, and honestly, it's more like a love-at-first-sight **(LAFS)** (Different people have different tastes, but I guess when most people encounter someone as LAFS, it's hard to get away from their attraction seriously).

So, I followed her into the interview room, meanwhile I was thinking about her more than the interview. We sat down. Our physical distance was closer than when I was shaking her hand during greeting. At that time, I just realized she was even more physically attractive than before, she probably turns into a at least 8.5 or 9 when close-up. Big eyes, thin lips, decent nose, but a really nice face complexion and skin texture (Kinda like ""superpowers"" aura you gave to others after nofapping for long time), generally a very young cute type of girl that will be well-liked in most places. It's really unimaginable an interviewer would look like this from a bank's human resource department. While she's asking for my documents, I was thinking ""Man, better that male line manager comes up not too soon so I can stay with this LAFS girl longer in this enclosed room."" At that moment, I was already attracted to her and out of the blue I told her ""You look really young like I guessed in the phone."" She laughed and so did I. But I also thought it could actually be awkward, she just didn't show it on face coz being polite and friendly.

She collected my documents and went out to find the manager. After sitting for 10 mins by myself, they came in and we have formal greetings. The male manager is around 50, decently looking. And I was told to start with self-introduction in English (It's not my native language but I'm relatively good in my country compared to average). I kinda messed that up in terms of English fluency compared to the level where I usually could perform, maybe because I was sick as hell, and I didn't prepare anything for the interview. It was quite awkward with my running nose in that moment.

After several questions being taking turn asked by them, which actually I did pretty decent, when answering one questions later, I started to notice this girl started to look at me in the eyes, in a way that an usual female interviewer wouldn't look at any candidate like that, kinda like an ""attracting me to explore and I should get to know her"" way, I was like ""man you better not looking at me like that during an interview, especially you are cute like that :/ Subconsciously I'm quite into you but I don't wanna risk my job chance either even tho I have only very little interest in this job"". After a while, my brain's logical guard was down because of her attractiveness. I decided to turn my approach of talking from looking into both of them once a while to looking straight deep into that girl's eyes. Once I started deliberately looking at her, her eyes turned away immediately, but I was still looking at her. Then she looked to me again after 3s to check if I was still looking at her. I still was and she started to seem look shy, but didn't turn her eye away this time, kinda like head and eyes going down, but her pupils are looking up towards you. At that point, we locked our eyes for like few seconds. (Thanks Nofap and you all every day positive articles for boosted confidence!!) I was feeling nervous and attracted internally right away because of her beauty but didn't show my face expression out as I was able to control it coz there is another male there and this is an interview after all. Also I am thankful for a god/parents-gifted fast-loading brain that I didn't mumble and stop speaking, even though at that moment the only thing I was thinking is her but not the interview at all.

For some reasons, I really want to impress her starting from that moment. So, all of a sudden I speak very positively (also the question asking towards me kinda related to it) about my passion, what I want in life ultimately when I was older, also my lately self-improvement in general. I was performing really well and suddenly she looks at me again, with enhance stare along with a newly-added smile throughout my speaking, I guess she's impressed. I notice her looking at me with that impressed face with sexy smile so I decided to do the same to her. When our eyes meet, this time the feeling is even more intense and different. We both subtly laughed with shyness because noticing each other laughs. I feel like there is an attraction, which could possibly be mutual. At that point, I was like ""DONT LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT MAN MY INTERVIEW COULD HAVE BLOWN UP"". It's the first time for long time, maybe even as so long as before fapping, or even ever, I have felt such attraction. My heart literally melted when looking at her, never had any girl giving me such a feeling. I told myself: ""Dude you must have to do something to get to know her"". In between, there was one moment I stopped speaking for few seconds because my heart melted too hard when looking at her, and my ""fast-loading brain"" finally stopped functioning for once. It was awkward for a sec but I turned back to be logical very quickly since it's quite inappropriate and not respectful to the man next to her also. Throughout the whole interview, our eyes locked and we smiled subtly again later, for probably more than 5 times.

The interview ended. The manager told the girl to bring me out to the HR office so I can take the lift. At this point, I really didn't want to leave as I know I will miss her so much. I really wanna speak something up so she will respond and I can hear her voice for the last time. But more than that, I wanna ask her if there were any way to contact her again, like a phone no. or stuffs. Kinda like ""Well we are around same age, do you wanna be friends?"" &lt;--- This kind of out of the blue stuff. But I decided not to but that would be awkward as hell. Well ofc my intention was always wanna close her number or directly ask if she's interested in grabbing a cup of coffee. Then in just few secs, I realized there is no chance I could do that, coz I am being interviewee meanwhile my interview assessments have just started. If asked, my job application would deem to fail even tho I have no interest at that job at all, especially I was applying for a job in banking industry. WHAT IF they blacklist me from entering this bank or even the industry forever? I can't risk that. Secondly, the location and timing seems extremely appropriate. We were around the door to be opened or closed (Which is a door that will separate each other). And most importantly, she is WORKING. If I asked for her number or done other awkward shit, she must think that I'm extremely unprofessional. There is no way she would want a stupid guy who has no environmental awareness to behave what he should be doing, to add into her life (assuming she is single). I figured out the chance will be 0% if asked. At least I wouldn't lose both job and that girl if not asked. So I decided to pop something up and said ""Thank you for the invitation and you really look like my cousin (in which case she does)"". She was awkwardly shocked for half sec and replied with a "":O"" face then laughed about it. At that moment, I know I shouldn't have said it but its done anyway. Suddenly she told me, I will be contacted within 2 weeks if the application were successful. I said ok and asked her what if unsuccessful. She said then I won't be contacted. I was like okay then we say bye to each other. On the way of leaving that office, I told myself ""If anything, it would be another time to approach but not at that moment, I'm happy I made this decision.""

After the interview, I went to another female job headhunter for talks for job in Starbucks. She was quite pretty (also found out she's single) and I was also able to hold eye but I'm not particularly interested because I was still thinking that early interview girl a lot. She didn't introduce many jobs to me because of incompatibility and I still asked her awkwardly in case of no job application being sent by her for me, ""do you still wanna hang out as friends sometimes?"" You know it's awkward because I provide her value initially that she asks me out through phone to introduce a job for me so she got referral fee, but after no job compatibility at that time, I should have no value for her but I still asked this. She responded ""Talk about this later."" I know I messed up a big time coz she could have been one of my options if I explored her deeper later even I didn't really have a lot of interest at the moment. But anyway thats' not the point.

# Opinions?

I went back home and had a long sleep after a long, tiring and awkward day. After I woke up, I still couldn't leave the early interviewer young lady behind. I thought of several ways to have opportunistic time to contact her so it would be more smooth, at least not too awkward. I remember she will contact me if job application was successful. So after she called me, I'll follow up with my approach to show interest and ask for her phone number. And in case she didn't call me, it means the application is unsuccessful. But I actually got her office phone number because she uses it when she invites me for interview. I will use an excuse of asking for how did the interview went and hows the result of appliaction, then follow up with the approach. What do you all think!? I also got her name from several mails she sent me before interviews. But I am pretty sure she wouldn't reply through gmail if I show interest in her there. So I search her name on FaceBook and found her. I think it's one of the ways to contact her but I think it could have been creepy, even if I said ""I wanna befriend with you because you are nice in the interview, so I decided to search your name on facebook"" vibe. Would be even creepier if I said ""I have interest in you, so I decided to msg you here on FB blah blah"". It's creepy as hell if you notice someone stalk you from way far, especially to a girl i guess.

Personally, the phone call seems the best option as it's smoother with follow-up questions. And she will also give me a straight forward of yes or no, instead of not replying through any other way, so I don't have to guess forever. Also, while speaking of so many approaches, I'm still not confident that if I should approach her this whole thing. My confidence rises up a bit after checking out other relationship advice thread, but I still struggle big time. I wanna do it because I don't wanna have any regret in case there would be any chance she could be my date, especially all the ""hints"" she has given to me throughout the interview. (But Yes, I might have read them wrong totally, could be have just her confidence to look at people and being friendly to smile, that i misinterpret them as flirting, coz I haven't had feeling and emotions before nofap, its my 1st time and I have no exp. at all). I also have a bit of rejection fears and ""blacklisting me forever in jobs"" fear even tho I realized I don't care about that bank chance and any job. But I tend to want to do it.

If I do approach her, I'm thinking about to say similar stuff through the phone like (Put her responses in between conversation in your brain yourself lol) : ""Thanks for the invitation for interview. I feel honored and appreciated a lot! And with slow and sincere tone: In addition, I actually have another thing wanted to ask you. I don't know much about this and I've never done this but I feel like I need to just for this time. Actually, throughout the interview, I found you pretty cute, there's something that I might called ""attraction"" seems I felt there. Other than wanting to befriend with you, I wanna say, actually, I'm quite interested in you. And I'd like to know if there would be a chance I can know you more? So, see if you are interested?"" I'm thinking about to do this in a slow way so she might feel I'm sincere and not that actually creepy. But also a bit worried she thinks this slow and hesitant approach is not manly and confident enough. // Btw her FB cover photo is with several girls, and her profile picture is actually by herself but captured seems in Disneyland. I don't know if this could be a sign that she already has a boyfriend. Also I saw the photo that she likes dancing and wear fashionable clothes, and few photos of being in a huge group of people, seems she is very outgoing, which is completely opposite to me, basically a loner and nerd which does not have many habits and friends until now after started nofap. Simply a guy with no life at all comparing to her.

I know the don't put all your eggs in one basket and there are plenty of fish in the sea stuffs, and I will never put any girl on a pedestal, including her. But I really feel like I'm attracted to this girl, and I think I should really do something about it, especially there is a possibility it could be of mutual interest with the expression she has given to me. But I'm not that confident and am quite a sophisticated guy. What do you guys think?? Should I approach her? If yes, in what what ways and what to say to increase chance? I really need some help and advice guys. Any feedback will be welcomed and appreciated. Thanks you all!

My boner drove me to google images. I fought the beast for half an hour attempting to stop my fingers from googling anything nsfw. Lost big time!

Luckily only Fapped twice but the damage has been done. I’m not mad at myself or disappointed as I am but a simple man. I forgive myself.

What I learned:

- Don’t stay in bed until 1pm on Saturday. Plan your day the night before.

- If having a moment where you feel any form of weakness/ anxiety/ feel like a bitch, avoid all internet at all costs.

- Recognise the root trigger and get the fuck outta there before it manifests into an uncontrollable urge

It's true that there were some moments that I felt dishearted, but I'm glad I have gotten back to NoFap. Now the number speaks for itself! Instead a year full of fapping, now I have a ~**73%** year free of it.

I am now have a healthier body, my grade is getting better and better, and the most important thing is that I have found my motivation for my life, no longer doing things aimlessly!

So, this year I will try my best to have a 90-day streak or even better, an entire year clean :)

21912,Motivation,"THE GREATEST WRITING ON THIS SUBJECT MAYBE EVER - ""The Problem &amp; The Solution""","## TL;DR at bottom

Hey Guys! I don't know if this has been posted here before but I wanted to share in case someone hadn't seen it. I began my journey a long time ago (about 4 years) and finally began succeeding when  I went to my fraternity and found out many guys were having the same issues. We started a weekly meeting that we eventually modeled after SA (sexaholics anonymous) meetings that we had attended together, and one of the most helpful parts of it for all of us was the SA readings that we did at the beginning of each meeting. The readings focus on ""the problem"" and ""the solution"" to sex addiction (which includes addiction to PMO in most cases). I've copied and pasted them here as motivation and education for anyone who hasn't seen them before and as a reminder for those who have!

&amp;#x200B;

***The Problem***

Many of us felt inadequate, unworthy, alone, and afraid. Our insides never matched what we saw on the outsides of others.

Early on, we came to feel disconnected—from parents, from peers, from ourselves. We tuned out with fantasy and masturbation. We plugged in by drinking in the pictures, the images, and pursuing the objects of our fantasies. We lusted and wanted to be lusted after.

We became true addicts: sex with self, promiscuity, adultery, dependency relationships, and more fantasy. We got it through the eyes; we bought it, we sold it, we traded it, we gave it away. We were addicted to the intrigue, the tease, the forbidden. The only way we knew to be free of it was to do it. “Please connect with me and make me whole!” we cried with outstretched arms. Lusting after the Big Fix, we gave away our power to others.

This produced guilt, self-hatred, remorse, emptiness, and pain, and we were driven ever inward, away from reality, away from love, lost inside ourselves.

Our habit made true intimacy impossible. We could never know real union with another because we were addicted to the *un*real. We went for the “chemistry,” the connection that had the magic, *because* it by-passed intimacy and true union. Fantasy corrupted the real; lust killed love.

First addicts, then love cripples, we took from others to fill up what was lacking in ourselves. Conning ourselves time and again that the next one would save us, we were really losing our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Solution***

We saw that our problem was three-fold: physical, emotional, and spiritual. Healing had to come about in all three.

The crucial change in attitude began when we admitted we were powerless, that our habit had us whipped. We came to meetings and withdrew from our habit. For some, this meant no sex with themselves or others, including not getting into relationships. For others it meant “drying out” and not having sex with the spouse for a time to recover from lust.

We discovered that we *could* stop, that not feeding the hunger didn’t kill us, that sex was indeed optional! There was hope for freedom, and we began to feel alive. Encouraged to continue, we turned more and more away from our isolating obsession with sex and self and turned to God and others.

All this was scary. We couldn’t see the path ahead, except that others had gone that way before. Each new step of surrender felt it would be off the edge into oblivion, but we took it. And instead of killing us, surrender was killing the obsession! We had stepped into the light, into a whole new way of life.

The fellowship gave us monitoring and support to keep us from being overwhelmed, a safe haven where we could finally face ourselves. Instead of covering our feelings with compulsive sex, we began exposing the roots of our spiritual emptiness and hunger. And the healing began.

As we faced our defects, we became willing to change; surrendering them broke the power they had over us. We began to be more comfortable with ourselves and others for the first time without our “drug.”

Forgiving all who had injured us, and without injuring others, we tried to right our own wrongs. At each amends more of the dreadful load of guilt dropped from our shoulders, until we could lift our heads, look the world in the eye, and stand free.

We began practicing a positive sobriety, taking the actions of love to improve our relations with others. We were learning how to give; and the measure we gave was the measure we got back. We were finding what none of the substitutes had ever supplied. We were making the real Connection. We were home.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone is interested in hearing more about how we structured our meetings and/or how we kept each other accountable outside of them, please let me know in my inbox or the comments and I would be happy to help you out!

22058,Telling my Story,Longtime Lurker -- Some Remarks,"Hey All,

&amp;#x200B;

I first discovered this trial/lifestyle change while driving home from college with my best buddy. We talked about how we were ashamed of this habit we had, and didn't even begin understand the consequences it had left on other parts of our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's a lot of emotion and energy in the subreddit, and I really like that, but let me explain some of my benefits that I have experienced in this last streak of 20 days. I'm going to paint this as a picture for you all in a less mystical and grandiose way ( I know people who are put off by another ""Change your life"" marketing style).

&amp;#x200B;

1. Less self guilt. When I abstain from something I think is inherently evil, I feel better. Not too much of a surprise there.
2. More voracity. This renders itself in multiple ways:
   1. More Energy in the Gym. I've noticed more energy for both going to the gym, and actually performance energy.
   2. Desire to compete in everything. Here's the kicker here, the competition is myself.
3. Self Advocacy:
   1. Given this situation, what can I say/do in the moment to get what is the most sustainable outcome (sometimes this is not equal to what I want).
   2. What outside of this situation can I control? Can I leverage a resource?
   3. Where can I learn to improve my control, my attitude, and communication in the efforts of a more sustainable solution?
   4. Self improvement -- NoFap enabled me to think about how I can improve myself. It made me more active in this, I was not granted superpowers or improvements by the NoFap fairy. I am my own fairy.

In addition to the more pragmatic features of NoFap, I definitely want to underscore some of the phenomenons I have felt:

&amp;#x200B;

1. More ""primal"" energy:
   1. A desire to create, destroy, and improve
   2. Definitely a smaller fuse, but I need one since I bend over backwards for others
   3. More authentic interactions -- say what's on your mind, don't get suppressed by your own fears
   4. A greater ability to reconcile when it is time to turn the other cheek, or retaliate and stand your ground in a combative interaction.
2. Ups and Downs
   1. The ups are real good, but I miss them real bad during the downs
3. The ""Good Sport"" identity. Comes from the idea that life is a series of games. In the event of a win, you may gain something, however, if you lose the goal is to be invited to another game and have another chance at winning. You can read a lot more into that concept in my opinion. Also this concept I stole from Jordan Peterson.
   1. It is much easier to be the goofy and playful dude I am at the office
   2. When I say something silly or stupid (in a bad way), it's much easier to let it go instead of feeling guilty.
   3. In every interaction I prioritize sowing the seeds for a following improved interaction. Whether that's learning what a person is into and creating plans to connect over it, or handling something bad constructively.

So there you have it, for the audience of ""What is this NoFap thing objectively, and how can I use it"", and also the ""Yo I heard some crazy things about this, and I want to learn more"".

&amp;#x200B;

I will say that I have yet to experience the better interactions with girls. Still don't seem to catch girls looking at me, or girls coming up to me when I go out. Maybe I need to change something, maybe I need to wait, maybe it's because I live in a very stand-offish part of the United States. Who knows. I'd lie to you if I said that this is something I don't care about.

&amp;#x200B;

 Also take everything I wrote with a grain of salt, I grew up religious and am actively seeking to improve my relationship with Christ.

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing, I really enjoy how this lifestyle change is framed on [menprovement.com](https://menprovement.com) I encourage people to look here and hear about some great tangible results, and how NoFap showed and fueled other people to get to the next level in their life.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for giving me some time to explain how I have noticed changes. Each streak teaches me something,

22079,Emergency - Help!,"I took a mild neuroleptic drug for 2 weeks and lost my libido, what to do?","I have OCD which have resulted in my doing compulsive online activities like trolling forums and masturbating up to 4x a day even when I had gf. I also had insanely high sex drive mostly caused by my anxiety or somewhat tied to it.

I tried this one neuroleptic drug (Mebicar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebicar ) in a small dose for 2 weeks to reduce overall anxiety and let me concentrate on work. My therapist prescribed it to me. I specifically asked if there won't be libido side effects, he said NO.

One positive thing I noticed that after taking the drug I lost wanting to fap 3x a day to hardcore porn like I was doing for last 20 years or something.

Well...""great"" right? Not really...when my girlfriend, who I really find attractive came over I had problems getting it up and maintaining erection.

I have stopped the drug for 2 weeks and still have no libido.

My testosterone is high, I work out regularly, eat right and am in peak physical shape for my age (27 yo).

It's like the drug switched off some anxious activities in my brain and I can't get them back. I also stopped doing some other unhealthy habits such as visiting specific subreddits compulsively. Now I feel like I should be wanting to visit pornsites, but I don't.

The worst thing? I took cialis and viagra before encounter with GF and even that got me hard only for a little while.

Funny thing - I still have dreams about me having sex with women and wake up with hard on. I forced myself to masturbate to porn which would have made me super horny and I was able to get hard and cum, but it wasn't enjoyable. I feel empty inside. I feel like something is taken from me. Both the bad thing, and the good thing.

I will try to visit therapist that prescribed me this asap and see what he has to say. Side effects did not mention anything about libido, but I think that I have been stressed out for such a long time that my brain learned to associate stress with sex and porn and once I cured the stress (more or less) the sex and porn sections shut down as well.

Now I want to have sex with my girlfriend and can't get hard. EVEN WITH CIALIS!

And I really don't have months to wait until I will ""flatline"" or some stuff like that. She will leave me if I won't be able to give her hard dick.

Now I’m 18, and my question is whether it’s worth doing another 90 day streak after two years. As I say I can easily go a few weeks at a time without M, and it’s very rare now that I watch porn, so I wouldn’t consider myself addicted to either. I do however have some concerns that fully repressing sexual desires for an extended period of time at this age could have negative consequences, so I’m torn as to what to do.

On one hand, I feel that I should push for the full 90 days again rather than the standard few weeks, but is repression actually a good idea with so many hormones, urges, etc at this age?

22137,Motivation,Too all of the newcomers...,"You may feel better and even more motivated after your first flatline has passed but remember, that’s when you start feeling good about yourself again which may lead to relapse, so here are the most risky days of relapsing:

Day 7: Some of you may have an early and quick flatline since you just started this addiction where you will recover very quickly because your body and brain isn’t that messed up just yet. Once you start feeling good about yourself will be the time you start thinking about “just one more fap and I’ll quit forever”.

Day 18— day 25: this is a risky time for long time fappers because theyre starting to control their energies and it’s easy to think that you won, let me tell you you’re not. You will get extremely horny around 3 or 4 weekish from all of the energy coming back up but your body isn’t used to storing it but it’s used to shooting them out.

Day 45—60: Sounds like a long time right? Actually this period of time isn’t as hard as the previous ones. You most likely have learned to control your energy if you can Last this long but you still have to be on your guard all the time, demons could be everywhere in this sleeping society.

Day 70—90: Just when you think you’re about to win, the demons of lust will come back to test you one more time as you have lowered your guard, hold on just a little while longer.

Day 150—170: Just a little testing by your own mind, you now have so much energy in your body and mind to do things so you most likely won’t care for this tiny pleasure of fapping but still, be on your guard.

Day 365: at this point you are most likely healthy both physical and mentally again but don’t go “celebrating” or you’ll lose everything you’ve earned with your hard work haha.

22145,Advice to NoFap,The reason nofap is so difficult,"Nofap is difficult because at one point we had no idea that it was bad for us. Just like with unhealthy junk food when your a kid you don't really understand how chips, sodas, fast food ect is bad for your health and by time your old enough to realize it you are already to hooked and don't wish to stop. When you are bored healthy ways to cope with boredom is to do something productive. But us porn addicts consumed our time with unproductive things. While our peers were developing their social status, personality and facing there fears of meeting women, we were consuming our minds with porn. When you start nofap you will have to find other ways to deal with your boredom and if your around my age and up (24) it can be really hard to get out and start socializing and working to build your personality up because normal people our age already have these things built up and can be in social groups without anxiety ect but it has to be done. Being home bored will lead to relapse and if your hanging out with friends you won't really have the chance to relapse. I personally don't have any friends. I have a gf and a cousin who I talk to a lot but that is it. Porn has caused me to be severely anti social and it sucks because I always wanted to be the popular guy with lots of friends and always able to do something in a group. Get out and socialize no matter how hard it is because this will help tremendously in the journey.  ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahpafg/the_reason_nofap_is_so_difficult/

22183,New to NoFap,Time for a Change.,"Last night I had a killer date with an awesome girl. Lunch with amazing convo, took her on a motorcycle ride to a lookout point, made out, she asked straight away to go back to my place. We were all over each other.

Arrived home, I couldn't get hard. She's sexy, patient, asking me how she can help...I thought it was nerves - first time with a new person is usually a bit jittery. But this was different. I felt numb. And then, when I couldn't get hard, just fucking useless.

Quick background: I divorced my cheating/alcoholic ex less than a year ago. Recently started dating again (but I'm mid-20's, so not a huge deal) and this was my first ever hookup/one night stand (she was on vacation). Now getting over emotional/physical repercussions of my last relationship has been a little rough, but overall, I'm very happy and healthy. I work out, eat well, good job, etc. But...you still try to fill the void with what's available. 

I thought maybe my past was affecting this too, but shit, I've NEVER had a naked girl in front of me and not been able to get hard, or felt numb to a blowjob. Something is wrong. 

Research. Spent like an hour googling similar scenarios last night, and I'd heard of NoFap before, but was kinda like ""that's nice, but I don't think that's necessary."" Wrong. Took a step back, too much porn, too much masturbation....no fucking wonder things aren't working.

So here I am! Starting anew, rewiring my brain so I can be healthier and set the stage for future healthy relationships and...activities. But yeah. Porn fucks you up. And masturbation....I'm definitely wasting time doing that

So this is day 1!! Already feeling better just for making the decision and not indulging last night and this morning. So thanks for being here. I get it now.

TL;DR: Tried to hook up with an awesome lady, couldn't get it up, researched, ended up here. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahpkn2/time_for_a_change/

I dont feel that clear state of mind that I used to feel when I was doing nofap in monk mode. When I wasn't using Internet or smartphone. For the last 40 days I am feeling like I am in a fog. I am loosing my self control. My cognitive abilities have decreased. All of these are happening because of one thing my smartphone. For past 40 days I have binge using my smartphone. I dont go outside, i dont exercide regularly, i am eating good, i dont talk to anybody. All I do is sit at my bed and stare at my phone doing mindless stuff. I feel like I have no control over myself. I am stuck in the grip of my phone. I cant stay away from my phone for even an hour. It is killing my gains that I have gained in last 2 years after starting nofap. In my opinion smartphone addiction is very serious problem and the biggest side effect of this addiction is lack of self control and massive increase in brain fog.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahplow/are_you_sure_100_of_your_brain_fog_is_coming_from/

***Self-discipline is key. I cannot stress this enough.***

Things that help:  
\- Waking up every morning at the same time   
\- Drinking 0,5 liters of water straight out of bed, prepare it the night before

\- Stretching the whole body, after that 30 squats, 20 push ups, 25 back raises, count down from 30 while doing planks and after that inhale and exhale 5 times before you drop your body. 

(This part helps the most. If I don't do it my day is kinda destined to be shitty.)  
\- Wearing an armband which is pretty usual but helps me remember why I even started all of this when some bad thoughts arise.

\- Removed the Reddit app since it consumed a lot of my time

 \- No Instagram or Facebook, THE HEAVEN OF TRIGGERS. Just occasionally go to Elon Musk's Twitter account because it's basically a meme page

22203,Journal Check-In,Daily journal entry: day 7,"A few days ago I thought that I would not have a problem with masturbation anymore because 1 week ago I had a breakthrough. I overcame certain emotions that was a result of trauma I experienced in childhood. After going through that experience I experienced high feelings of happiness that i hadn’t experienced since childhood and after that I thought I had done it. I learnt that addiction is caused by some form of emotional trauma and I thought because I had that breakthrough in my trauma I wouldn’t masturbate anymore but I was wrong. I masturbated today (once) and the truth is my emotions aren’t fully resolved, emotional trauma is still there. This type of relapse has been happening often and it always follows the same trajectory. I go a week of Nofap and during the end of the week I feel immense emotional pain that is too overwhelming for me to deal with so I suppress it using masturbation, this dampens my emotions and I feel like I have no emotions sometimes. My mind has been alternating from very high depression where it feels like I want to kill myself to high levels of happiness and it can happen in the span of hours. My emotions are in flux because of my masturbation problem. I also don’t trust myself which is very painful because self- trust is how a man develops strength, without it I have nothing. I feel broken because I can’t trust myself to overcome my masturbation problem. It’s always, ‘ok next time I’ll have the strength to overcome the emotional pain’ but I always break and I can’t handle it. It also doesn’t help that I have no one in real life to talk about my emotional pain because I need a way of processing them if I want to move on in my life and overcome this. By the way being in a state of constantly being busy all the time doesn’t work because there are times where you can’t work and have to just be with yourself and your emotions, when that happens that’s when it really becomes difficult.

I feel like a complete fucking failure and I want to hit something. I’m so angry at myself for not being a better person. 

This addiction has a tight fucking grasp on me and the only person to blame is myself. At the same time, fuck instagram, and fuck worldstar. Posting stupid instagram thots had me horny while I was in bed. I just couldn’t contain myself.

It started with just going on the NSFW sub on reddit and seeing some porn to try and monopolize on my already horny hard cock. Until eventually I went full stroke.

At the very end I almost raged because I was so angry at myself for failing. I will use this as a lesson to become stronger and avoid instagram at all costs. As well as to never give up.

I’m embarking on this journey for the third and final time. I will not fail. Don’t wish me luck because where I am going I will not need it. If it takes putting a rubber band around my cock to keep that monster soft I will do it. I’m done with this disgusting practice once and for all.

I've been using all my sexual energy in exercise and meditation. I have to admit that I feel much better with the passing of days ✌🏻 

To control the urges, when I'm going to take a shower, i wet my friend with cold water 🚿 

Whenever I feel like watching porn and masturbating, I remind myself that I do not do it because im hot, but because my brain needs dopamine and it's an addiction 💪🏻 

I'm also doing kegel exercises 👀 

And the best part is that I'm convinced that I'll be there all year without seeing that shit and touching my self 😄

I have a beautiful girlfriend and a great life to take advantage of ❤️

22405,Journal Check-In,Journal check in - MJ 1/19/19,"I hope everyone is doing well tonight I’m checking in from a city in upstate ny and am bracing for a snowstorm rn, figures I’d do a check in.

I’m about a month and a half or so into the PMO journey, I hooked up with a girl and Od about 15 days ago and then had a wet dream last night. I am trying to go the semen retention route, if a beautiful women im attracted to lands in my lap I’m not going to sex down but I’m not going to spend any effort chasing it either. I’m trying to get all lustful thoughts out of my head and it helps with the urges. Whenever I have an unwanted thought I try not to go down that fantasizing path that leads to edging that leads to relapse. I keep thinking about how shitty I would feel to lose all this progress, my relapses usually end up with a binge, having suicidal thoughts and then having no energy for a week or 2 after I finally do get back on the horse. Who the fk would want that? Not me.

Anyway I’m a little upset about the wet dream I had yesterday. Been sluggish and have been having a lot more negative thoughts, also have a headache and am not thinking as clearly or as motivated as I was before. I know they are not a big deal and you shouldn’t feel bad over them but the physical and emotional effects of the wet dream are still hampering me. Also little upset bc since Od with the girl a couple weeks ago I haven’t gotten back to the gym, I feel like she stole my energy lol

my thoughts on women after a month and a half or so of no fap are really changing, like I want a gf who would make a good partner and is a good person not someone who’s just sexually attractive..

Idk I apologize for rambling. Peace and love brothas, stay strong and resist those urges to become the best version of you.

22426,Telling my Story,I f**king love nofap,"Nofap was hard, it make me so emotionally weak. Some night of the week I felt so weird, I was thinking about all my relations and the possible one. I realized that I have friend that are not really my friend...
Some night I didn't sleep, thinking how bad my last few years was...

But,
I need to correct, nofap made me alive, with real emotion.
I started remember some child traumas ( basically me causing harm/accident involuntary to friend ) that I have completely forgotten,  and I started to heal them ( helped me with social anxiety ).

I started exercising more, Meditating, and be more in the present moment, enjoy life at it's fullness! I stopped all the drugs ( I am only 17, and I already have a experience with differents drugs ... ).

It's hard! Rewiring correctly, it take times too! Starting fresh from the new year was a motivation!

Tonight a girl, that I particulary like ( but I never really talked to her it was just hello How's going nice ect), asked me if I wanted to see her. So I did went to ses her and It was a really great moment!! I rarely talk freely and it make me feel so good! And I feel much closer to her. I felt a bit weak, and I exposed some of my 'hidden' feeling: feeling of loneliness, of nonsense, 'fake' convos, all peoples on their smartphone ect ect ...

Just wanted to write this post because I really feel good again, and I want to give some motivation for some of you that are struggling.

My point is, Nofap is just the start! You can become what you want, there is no you that are defined, and you can change. Start slowly and try to go out of your comfort zone, even a little, every day!
Life is hard, but it's good, we almost only have connections and relations between friends, family, lovers! There will be deception, things will not be as expected, but keep going!

The real joy and hapiness come from your inside peace with you: don't seek for money, fame or fake relationship.

&gt;I had a previous streak of 85 days who ended in 2 month of constant relapses. It make me feel good but nowhere from this 20 days+ streak. It might be from the use of drug ( cannabis ) during the streak, as well as some peaking.

I start to believe I can do other things, even when everything else does suck. That’s worth more to me and my relationship than anyone who’s not going through this could ever know.

Urges appear and disappear, I've found the panic button pretty helpful.

I'm thankful to Jesus for these resources that help me fight against PMO in my own life.

Recently I've been learning about how to actually get stuff done.

I've been a master of procrastination, and I still somewhat am. Still, I've taken my first baby steps out of that. I've been ashamed of procrastination for what feels like the longest time ever. I know that Bible too talks about sloth as a bad thing, and I've been thinking about it a lot recently. Thinking about how I just need to take action, no words, no excuses, just action. But the stuff that has made the final push for me, so that I've taken my first steps, is the panic button motivational stuff and some of the nofap reddit posts. Just avoiding PMO hasn't made me active, or even active-ish, in the way that I'd stop procrastinating on uni stuff etc. It's been a longer process to me, and it has involved getting rid of video gaming too (of which all thanks to God) and has required a lot of self-analysis and other stuff.

But what's important is that I've become more active, even if in just small portion for now. After all, the first steps are usually the hardest? I guess I'd need to press on no matter how I feel about it.

22759,Confession,free fall,"This   is my first reddit post ever, please be kind. I will do my best to   avoid any trigger words and offend anyone.   I've been floating on the   periphery of this NoFap concept for over 7 years.  I have my doctorate   and believe there is a lot of fact about the addiction science that   nofap and yourbrainonporn have contributed over the years, yet somehow   I've remained trapped in it.  This post will be similar to an   introduction/confession at an AA meeting I suppose.  I will go through   my history of porn progression and personality changes.  I hope this   does not cause a reset/relapse for anyone.

I   can remember being 9 years old when I first met my dark passenger (in   the words of dexter).  It was exciting and I was always very curious   about the female form as a kid who grew up being the only boy with 10   female cousins/sisters.  It was an old school pop-up for play boy from   the days of dial up internet.  From that moment I was hooked.  I would   google image search when nobody was around for models then it progressed   to lesbian videos.  That secret satisfaction lasted well into high   school where I had a lot of friends and was a popular athlete.  I even   had solid girl friends.  I didn't think it was a problem and it   certainly didn't interfere with who i believed i was or cut into my   personality.

In preparation for college I   bought my first laptop and things started to spiral although it didn't   feel like it.  Instead of getting my jollies on the family computer  when  the moment was perfect, I now had unlimited access.  It progressed  from  being satisfied looking at images of women to full on hetero  porn.  I  was in an obsessive relationship at the time and began  college.  Up  until this point I had never had sex.  Porn was the only  ""sex"" I was  having and I justified it because it was keeping me a  ""virgin"" until I  could get married.

Fast   forward 6 months into freshman year of college and I find out the  woman  i'm going to marry, the love of my life is has been having sex  with  other people throughout our entire 3 year relationship.  People I  knew.   I tried to be okay with it and forgive her so that we could  continue  our relationship.  This is when porn became my crutch, my only  reliable  friend.  It was always there for me when she would tell me  details about  what had happened.  It numbed my pain.  I began to  completely change as   a person.  Less energy, less active, less zest,  less adventure, more  sarcasm, more cynicism, more hate, more anxiety,  more drinking.  My  tastes for harder porn grew.  It was no longer love  making on video it  was rageful and humiliating to the women.  It was  about power and  control.

This   progression scared me and I confided in my girlfriend (who i had   forgiven for cheating on me) what was happening to me.  She was   disgusted with me...  Even though she had been cheating, this was   intolerable for her.  She ended it.  I dropped out of college because I   was so devastated.  I went back home with family and began to heal from   the relationship, but porn was still the crutch whenever I hurt.  It  was  so humiliating.

During  this  humiliation I found transgender porn.  I felt shame but it brought  me  pain-free moments.  I romanticized the male submission to female  form.   I wanted the woman to screw me so I could have a physical   manifestation of what I had emotionally been through.   I sexualized my   pent up humiliation.  I started college up again at a new university  and  things continued to progress.  I started to realize I had a  problem. I  started going onto craigslist to look for meet-ups with  trans doms.   This lasted for 2 years and became my hobby; looking but  never following  through.  Until one night I was drunk and did.   \*disclaimer I have  nothing against transgender people\*  I felt awful  the next day,  questioned who I was, and my sexuality.   I turned again  to porn who  introduced me to sissy hypnosis and poppers.  I was hooked.   I wanted to  be the woman.  I no longer felt ashamed I felt so  empowered and wanted  to go out and do all the things I was watching on  the screen.  Luckily I  never did.  I knew it was the drugs talking...  but i felt alive again.

Throughout  all  this time I continued to date women because I knew I wanted a wife  to  be in love with and start a family.  I struggle with the fact that i   had this double life.  Normal dude during the day, sissy at night when   nobody was around.  While addicted i would occasionally read nofap and   try for a day or two then let it go.  I still didn't believe I had a   problem and I liked it.  I didn't feel shame or guilt.  I liked my vice.     I started hitting strip clubs and visiting a BDSM femdom providor.    The hypno porn satisfaction began to drop and it only made me feel   semi-alive.  This continued for 2 years and was very expensive.  Here I   am today 19 years after that pop-up.

Porn   made itself the god of my life and changed who I am.  I never wanted  to  be this person.  I want to go back to being my adventurous energetic   self, but my habits have been entrenched for 15 years.  I am not in   control.  I hope I didn't break any rules and that this post was not   offensive to anyone.  I hope it helps anyone else going through what I   have.  I would like to try to reboot.  Please help.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahtlw9/free_fall/
22775,Question to NoFap,Pre relapse ramifications,"Alright... I've successfully identified what causes me to relapse once in a weekly basis (albeit it's to erotic images and the relapse lasts 2 mins at max), and that is _stress_

Now, what exactly can I do to reduce stress? I know of meditation and exercise, but whenever I get sore I can't exercise or meditate (I run alot so the pose hurts), so that leaves me vulnerable to feeling stressed (no girlfriend, boredom felt in job is immense, can't drive yet despite being 20 due to brain fog, etc)

22784,Advice to NoFap,Theory of Mine," Here’s something interesting I thought about the other day that’s helped me, figured it’d be good to put it out there in case it can help anyone else.

In reading stories about people who have been in these filthy waters way deep and seeing the effects it’s had on them physically, emotionally, and mentally, it made me wonder as to why it hasn’t affected me as deeply, especially considering how long I’ve been struggling with this, and given the fact that the biggest trigger for me is my own head.
  I have a ridiculously vivid and active imagination.  It honestly feels like I have a simulator in my head.  Works GREAT for reading, writing, and art.  But when it comes to porn and fantasies, my head is my own worse enemy in every possible way.  I can feel, hear, and more EVERY SINGLE LITTLE DETAIL.  My brain builds such an accurate simulation based on deduction, assumption, and ANY prior experience it can get it’s hands on, making it EXTREMELY detrimental.
  Yet, a lot of the deeper psychological symptoms aren’t present in me, and a lot of my core personality and values remain in tact, and here’s my theory as to why:
  My own worst enemy might have done me some good!
  Because I have such an imagination, my mind personified it early on as a means to cope and quantify this disease.
  To me, it feels like a beast or monster, sitting in the darkest recesses of my mind, quietly weaving it’s doubts, lies, and poison throughout my mind.  When it wants it’s degrading fill, it crawls out and demands its hunger be satisfied.
  If I deny it, then it digs its claws deep into me, thrashing me, screaming into my face until I relent, sending it slithering back into the abyss until it wants more.  And when so try to resist in that weakened state now, it laughs and kicks me over, greedily devouring its fill before it slinks away and cackles in the darkness.
  But when I weather the assault, plant my feet, and take the pain, it slithers away dejected and sullen until the next time.
  And every time I say “no,” it gets weaker.
  And the weaker it gets, the more violent and desperate its assault.
  But we have to rise above the pain.  Every time you do, you get stronger.  Every time it gets more afraid.
  The day will come when you’ll be able to stand tall, grip that sick little monster by its throat, look it in the eye and say “Enough.”
  Fight for that day.
  That’s my two cents for today.  Spent a good chunk of my (clean, happy to report!) Day 2 pondering and refining this.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahtpdq/theory_of_mine/
22786,Question to NoFap,A question about increased mental capacity,"There are lots of undeniable evidence of people getting more attractive and shining.

22910,Motivation,For those of us in college...,"For those of us in school:

The spring semester is upon us. Work is going to start piling up and the stress is going to increase exponentially.

Now is the time to stay really strong!! If you crack it WILL (guaranteed) take away your motivation and impact your stress levels and potentially your performance in school.

Let's continue to fight the beast in the face of extra stressors.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: In my experience, when I would do it as a break from studying, it would help me focus in the short term, but in the long term (next day or two) my productivity levels would decrease to 10% and **my motivation would be gone**. Not doing it at all forces you to deal with your stress (i.e. conquer your school work in a timely manner). Not doing it enabled me to get things done before the last minute and **CHANGED MY LIFE in terms of the amount of stress I had throughout the semester**. It didn't impact my grades either (no one said you can't get high grades while you jerk off as you study-I've done it before too).

Edit Edit: Also, brain fog is a thing! Your mind is your tool when you study– if you break the tip of your pencil, you can't use it unless you take the time to sharpen it again. Just keep it sharp and you won't have to wait on line for the sharpener like everyone else.",92,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahugda/for_those_of_us_in_college/
22945,Motivate Me,"Day 3 of 120: NoFap - No urges, no twitches... Feeling pretty good","# 20th of January 2019 - 117 days 15 hours and 41 mins left

This was unexpected. Usually, in my last four attempts, by now I'd feel twitchy and irritable. Perhaps this is how progress works. It's never one shot. You ride the bicycle, you fall, you try, you fall again once more, and then you start feeling the bike and start riding it (*Confession: I recently learned how to ride a bike lol*).

I think it also has to do a lot with me posting on reddit. I received some wonderful feedback and the r/nofap community here is great! In my last four attempts I had little support on this matter but this time I am accountable to the people reading it. Which feels great!

I know I will inevitably want to relapse again but this time I am ready. Thank you all. :)

22955,Motivation,You just relapsed ?! Learn from it.,"Did you ever analysed what happenned minutes before you start masturbating and ruinning your streak ?!

Yes, sure. You were trigerred and couldn't resist the urge. Why ?

- If it's by socials medias, TV or smth you can control directly, LEARN FROM IT.
Delete/reduce it.

- If it's by your own imagination, chances you were wandering in fantasy and being bored. LEARN FROM IT.
Get busy improving yourself (books, gym, self developement, new skill, whatever).

- If it's while you're in bed, morning or evening, you probably wanted to reach your smartphone to ""surf this website"". LEARN FROM IT. Place your smartphone as far away from your bed. Buy you a real alarm. Kick your own ass.

- If it's because you felt lonely and want to feel at bit better. LEARN FROM IT.
Go on r/meditation and start your journey to love yourself and be at peace with yourself.

- If you don't know why, describe it by posting it. We can help you with our lights.

*Whatever is the reason why you relapsed, take it as a chance.*

You relapsed because you didn't knew you were sensitive to WHAT hapenned before PMO.

EVERYTIME you relapse, LEARN FROM IT. Write on a paper what happenned minutes before. You'll see quickly what was the trigger, and now you can avoid it.

Everytime you relapse, you getting closer from your lifetime streak.",44,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahuoa8/you_just_relapsed_learn_from_it/
22971,Relapse Report,End of Day 0 Log - Relapse Report &amp; Celebrating my Longest Streak,"I made it 35 nights without watching porn. Along the way, towards the end, there were encroaching bits of sex fantasy and I started masturbating when near sleep, but I went my whole winter break without any PMO (which was my goal when I started posting logs). Things got harder when I went back to college.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I watched porn for about an hour, then fantasized a lot in bed and masturbated. That's a relapse night, complete package. Not gonna discount it anymore. It felt bad when I was done and it felt bad in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, it's weirdly now the happiest relapse I've ever had! Only one hour of porn? 35 nights since the last time? That's improvement! Admittedly winter break made it easier, but it's a big improvement. I've watched porn during breaks before.

&amp;#x200B;

College life is hard, emotionally. I am anxious, lonely, and feeling kind of hopeless about some things, though I think a lot of it is irrational. While I am going to start posting on here again, I am also starting to look for therapy for emotional issues that haven't been severe enough for me to admit that they're problems before. They are problems, and when I really look at them and stop numbing them it's not good. I want to get through tonight, and then make a goal for getting through the coming week. No FPM - Fantasy, Porn or Masturbation, since those are my problems and usually in that order. Posting here helps so I'll be resuming nightly logs. I'll probably also use this as a place to start processing my thoughts about anything else I need to change in life, unless there's another sub that's better for that.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahuth7/end_of_day_0_log_relapse_report_celebrating_my/
22974,Motivation,Something I noticed on my journey that may give you hope.,"So about 50 days ago, I started this PMO challenge. It’s been an extremely tough and horrid two months with me having a total of 7+ relapses, all which I’m not proud of.

I started off not even being able to last 3 days without relapsing. But eventually, I started setting goals. Every time I relapsed on my goal day or more, I set a new goal. 3 days became 4 days, 4 days became 7 days, and 7 days became 14 days.

I noticed that the more I was able to resist the urges, the easier this challenge got to me. I was able to get more self control. For those people who are thinking “if resisting the urges are hard now, it’s gonna be impossible to keep doing this in X amount of days”, you are absolutely wrong! It just gets easier! 

So keep on resisting, beat your goals, and get hyped when reaching them ❤️

22992,Motivate Me,I had Failed you all... [Conscious decision relapse],"I had posted on Friday  that u had sex with a girl but couldn't climax. She called me again last night and ask how Im holding up, asked to meet me and try again more passionately this time.

So we met, and had sex...For 4 HOURS, with few breaks in between, and I just couldn't cum! Now she obviously says she hurts and couldn't continue anymore, was the last straw and left me by myself AGAIN!. I obviously was sad and never before in my life felt so helpless ...All the while thinking what if NoFap has changed me...Which shouldn't be the case because whenever the penetration happens, I was always hard, just couldn't reach the point of climax...After long time fatigue finally took over. It's fucking weird feeling where you still have this strong urge to have sex but just couldn't climax...I could feel this pressure in my lower abdomens building up, very unpleased feeling btw.

So I back home, lies in my bed touching myself, tried to ejaculate. After about 15 mins, I gave up, pacing around the room and finally decided to open my browser and finish the business...The whole process was rather quick tho, and now I'm in my bed, typing this, felt nothing at all, not as tired as before when I finished masturbate. I just feel NOTHING. 

I know I should feel more bad as the relapse happened. But a part of me thinks it's okay to finally release the pressure building up after 2 days of sex with NO ejaculation!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahv17u/i_had_failed_you_all_conscious_decision_relapse/

Back to the point, I saw a post of some girl “showing herself” off; it was somehow a post that was still up even though she was pretty much nude. I was disgusted, yet I checked out her page to check how many followers she had, and I was astonished. There were literally over 400 THOUSAND people following her. I then saw that there were more of these types of accounts, with even MORE followers...it’s so crazy how bad social media actually is at this point. I never remember this happening a few years ago! Most of the time, people didn’t even want to show their face, let alone their whole body. Anyway, my point is, even though there are few of us, it doesn’t mean that what we achieve and what we strive for is wrong. Don’t let anything tempt you. Whenever you see those things, block those accounts. Report those posts — it’s not right and I know none of us like it! Anyway, keep up your streaks guys, I give my best to everyone.

23176,Emergency - Help!,Starting a hardmode again - need some advice - fuming inside,"31M, Was on PMO for 10 years and this is the first time am aware of PIED/ PMO. Have been trying to do the nofap from december/2018 and the streaks were 5 - 22 - 8 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 5 - 7. Was almost recovered from PIED from the second streak, but not PMO. The problem now is I cant keep the streak for more than a week full clean.  On the start of last streak have made an elaborate list of daily activities which make my day busy, tired and was well prepared for it.

On starting a streak, first few days was able to continue as planned by finishing the activities without sparing any free time, from day 4 the sleeplessness gets hitting in, but  I don't see any effect on energy levels, have prepared some todo list on sleepless nights too. The problem is somehow or some day have to diverge from the daily committed activities (injury/pain from workout, visit friends, go for a weekend vacation, see girls/couples on the public - trying hard not to look, still get some glance and later the memories gets rolling in the mind..., lack of sleep - thinking its harmful to go for running or do workout without a well rested body).  


Once I miss the daily must todo commitments on a day, the urge slowly begins on the next day(some sort remorse floods that I couldn't stay on track) and some point starts peeking involuntarily( don't know the right word to put here). The moment I think of peeking, am losing the rational thinking and its kind of entering a deep sleep. After peeking, realize the damage has done, had to end to streak. This has been the story on last 3 streak relapses. I want to stop this cycle and overcome it. Am highly worried as am going for another vacation next week and won't be able to do the daily commitments for few days and I don't want my streak to end. 

&amp;#x200B;

Decided to stop going out with friends (until am confident have recovered from PMO) and get distractions or jealous by hearing their success stories with gals and stop going for any vacations ( the next weeks one which I already committed) If I had to go out for some stuff like shopping, it's kind of going straight to point, get the job done and come back.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to the guys on hard mode is, how do you do it on a daily basis? Is it by following strictly the todo list of self improvements and avoid/reject all other activities which hiders the daily routine? How to handle the remorse when the daily commitments streak is broken?  


To the good note - Over the one and half month time, feeling more confident, can say NO, can spend time wisely, reduced social anxiety but still no where near to public speaking/ talk to random girls, less worrying, can start conversations with strangers, more energy levels, better body posture and more conscious about the surrounding and situations, can quickly get back to new streak, and finally no more ""YOU ARE SILENT"" guy in group conversations that annoys me a lot.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahvv7x/starting_a_hardmode_again_need_some_advice_fuming/

23233,Success Story,Finally hit one month!!,"I discovered nofap 2 years ago, my life was miserable and I turned to porn since I was 10 (9 years ago) and I guess it was circular, I turned to porn because of a miserable life but porn made it that way in the first place.
So at age 17 I discovered this thing, Nofap, and I began to read about it, I decided that I had enough and that I want to change my life.
After many many many attempts and small streaks I couldn't pass 10 days, I simply couldn't, my brain kept making up lies:

- Just a peak won't harm
- It's not that bad
- Everyone does it
- Any other excuse that made me believe it was ok.

But the good thing in all of this was that every relapse I had, made me want more and more to quit.
You see, a relapse feels bad, really bad, if you can you should run from it, but if you can't, learn from it: What made you relapse? What made you open incognito mode? What can you do to be aware of an urge and to fight it?
I learned from mine through my attempts.
It wasn't easy, It will not be easy, but let me tell you, nothing good for you is easy.

23251,Question to NoFap,Longest streak,"So I’m on day 20 now. This is the longest I’ve gone in my adult life (33M) without fapping or even ejaculating. 17 days was my best last year when I was on a road trip. 

When I started, this was difficult - I was fapping to P 2-3 times a day before I started and couldn’t get it up with my gf and was also struggling to get it up with P. Apart from a couple of times of looking, no fapping, I’ve got through and now the urge to look has gone. 

On a side note when I did look I actually disliked the hardcore stuff and only looked at models - this is not justifying it, just saying how my mindset changed after only a few days, it was really surprising. 

While I’m happy - but treading with caution - that the urge to look and fap can be controlled now, my sex drive seems to have gone too. I’m thinking clearer, feel calmer, more productive, energetic, happier - but no sex drive. And it’s really upsetting my gf. We haven’t had sex during this time but I thought by stopping fapping I’d get even hornier and it would improve things between us. But that isn’t happening. I get random waves of horniness but that’s usually alone and I make myself busy so I don’t fail to day zero but I’ve only woken up twice with a boner and that was in the last week - improvement on never waking up with a boner! 

So my question is has anyone else experienced this loss of sex drive during their reset? Is it normal and to be expected? Or should I be worried?

Fapping actually helped me relief stress especially after studying and fulfills my loneliness. 

I've stopped masturbating at some point, but that is only when I had a girlfriend and did not feel lonely at all. Now, im alone and I feel the need to masturbate to relax my myself and stop feeling horny. My thought here is that I would only stop masturbating when I grow up and leave the country.

23285,Telling my Story,An interesting story(read it only if you have a lot of time),"2 years ago I joined a law college ...let me introduce myself to you  2 years ago I was a shy , anxious , acne faced guy with poor social skills and obviously no talent . Making a Girlfriend was a sweetest dream for me actually it was Fantasy for me ,and yeah I was great Fapper (fapped around 3times a week)  I was literally sexually attracted every Girl who behaved nicely to me . 

         With my poor social skills I still tried to make friends and socialize with people around me but everyone just tries to ignore me I was craving to make friends and then I made friendship with a guy (who was super rude but I still Sat with him because I literally had no self respect) he was in a friends group with 2 other girls with whom I also became friends , one day A girl who was famous in the college came to me and asked my name we talked a bit and then she started becoming very friendly with me.. And me as always i started fantasizing having sex with her and So yeah! This was me .
She used me as a timepass guy because she was a Psychopath who only needed a low confidence guy like me to spend time with her when she felt alone , She would call me anytime and start sharing her past (and it was really fuckall) 

one day she engaged in fight with some other girl I would call her Myfriend from now
(Myfriend just said her that her mother is a prostiute for no reason at all )
And that girl just beated the shit out of myfriend
Then next day myfriend called me ,asked for help (that I would tell a lie to college principle that she said nothing bad instead that girl had said something very vulgur to my friend) I disagreed to help her (because telling a lie to principle would cost me failing my exams ,losing the social respect and friends too because that girl with whom myfriend had fight with was socially well and was actually nice to everyone) and she just told me stay away from her rest of my life .

 Let me tell you about myfriend she was a type of girl who would always find a guy like me , she would always do bitching about other girls , she would always tell me about her foreigner cousins even if I did not asked , She would waste my time and force me sit with her even if I was busy and had some work to do , so that she could tell me her fuck all story and instead of confronting her I would do nothing and try to make her happy so that she could have sex with me one day .

I was the most vulnerable(and creepy) guy in the whole class with no self esteem and Fantasy to have sex with every beautiful girl and have no guts to do anything in order to achieve it.. And the most worst part I felt Okay to be like this.

Then 1 year ago I saw a guy same of my age who literally became role model for me
HE WAS COOL , CONFIDENT , NO SHIT GIVEN ATTITUDE ,NOT RUDE , HAD GUTS TO SAY ANYTHING TO ANYONE BUT WAS CALM NICE AND SOFISTICATED , Luckily he became friends with me.. After noticing him I came to know difference between confidence and rudeness , I started watching videos of how to become cool and confident . and came to know about no fap.. 


At beginning it was so hard for me but as time passed I became comfortable in it.My personality started developing I started developing public speaking skills Now I will tell you what progress I have made

1. I read a lot of books of my course and also self help books from different writers such as Brian Tracy ,Napolean Hill etc.
2. I have developed an attitude or habit of not thinking much and speak my mind
3. I have a huge self respect for myself now.
4. I don't fantasize having sex with every girl 
5. I stopped being nice and started being what I actually am
6. I stopped making efforts to make peoples happy if they are rude to me
7. I stopped watching porn (Just kidding I would watch it like once a month ) 
8. I stopped trying to be fake cool 
9. I stopped doing showoff for making friends 
10. I started playing guitar 
11. I made a goal to do a stage performance of guitar skills in my next college fest .
12. I started being helpful only for my happiness not for appreciation
13. If I like somebody I would tell them
14. I try to improve my public speaking skills everyday
15. I practice guitar at least 1.5 hours a day
16. Now I know what to do with my life and I have a plan. 
17. I still don't have a girl friend because I don't want to make before I buy my own car .
18.Now I am salty enough to roast anyone who tries to put me down while my Public speaking speeches/ Debates .
 

 Few weeks ago "" my friend ""(who told me to stay away from her rest of her life) came across me and started talking we talked a bit then she asked me sit with her in the class but this time m not gonna fall .. I told her that I cannot sit with her because I don't like sitting with her and she bores me as fuck.. She shocked , Felt bad for her but my new personality will not fit with her  and listen her Fuckall rubbish speech for hours

Is it ok if I do that or should I just keep trying to go all in ?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahwrn0/is_it_ok_to_do_it_once_a_week/
23313,New to NoFap,My story...Newbie,"K9 is downloaded on the laptop. BlockSite is downloaded on the Android phone. Dating apps are shut down.

It's time to begin.

Since breaking up with my GF last April (from an Asian country), I sunk right back into masturbation and porn to the extent that my bedroom was a self-inflicted jail cell. Pornhub, and XVideos was fueled by the convenience of UberEats meaning I didn't even have to get dressed, leave the apartment and function as a human being.

&amp;#x200B;

But why did I turn to porn....? Here's my story.

&amp;#x200B;

**Relationships:**

I stand by my reasons for ending my most recent relationship after a year and a half, as I felt underappreciated in the relationship. Although we worked well together (far better than other relationships I see every day), we wouldn't have been able to satisfy each other's goals in the long term.  She would demand her way only, and couldn't meet in the middle. Like an 8-year-old in a 27-year-old's body.  In my first relationship (me aged 25) I was cheated on by her with our colleague and was forced into forgiving her, otherwise, it would be paraded in front of me. After ending it after 8 months, she slept with 6 more of my colleagues. Yeah, no loyalty from the guys when there's a girl with a vendetta and open legs it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dating Apps:**

How anyone hooks up with anyone I have no idea? Maybe it is a result of the Asian country I am in, and my reluctance to go to clubs to pick up girls (I am introverted, and more of a daytime cafe guy, maybe a few craft beers and nice conversation), but the tens of hours I put into intermittently using apps between porn wasn't worth it.  I instead met insecure girls who had boyfriends already and were hypocrites, was canceled on by girls 11 times on the day of the date, and only got laid a few times by the same girl who was dating a few guys at once. She stopped sleeping with me after I revealed feelings for her and asked to date her. Apparently, that was a bad thing?!

&amp;#x200B;

**Eternally damned Friendzone:**

5 girls in the last few years. Same thing. Be a nice guy. Be there for them when they get screwed over by an asshole. Be there when they are feeling down. Be there for them when their female friends weren't. Reveal crush on them and ask them out for a date. Her Response: That's unacceptable. Is there no such thing as pure friendship anymore? Me: Well time to search for Alina Li on Pornhub and jerk off. The only two girls who I had relationships with were girls who asked me out.

&amp;#x200B;

**It's not all been bad:**

There have been times, when girls have been horny online with me. Normally this lasts for a day to a week. It has ranged from playing strip games on social messaging apps, masturbation (including with toys and a carrot?), and just naughty talk.  It was always online only for the most part though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Porn:**

So with all that stuff, needless to say, I resorted to jerking off a lot. Mainly Asian stuff (again, I live in Asia so am surrounded by Asian girls). Over time that spread to cuckold stuff too. Guess that's the result of being cheated on ;) I still get turned off by the nastier stuff but the problem was jerking off became my go too. Multiple times a day, and sometimes in an hour. That has led to me feeling more zombie-like.

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's do this!:**

I recently quit my job (it was a source of great stress due to poor management and a lack of community) and have set myself some goals for 2019.

1. Pass a qualification next month.
2. Find a job with a positive community which isn't all about drinking and bitching about co-workers (DONE, my old company but in a new city)
3. Focus on exercising for 10 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes to an hour in the evening every day.
4. Quit all social media apps until March and block/mute anyone who was a toxic influence on my life.
5. Do not search for porn (K9 and Blocksite installed and ready)

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

I do not want anyone's pity and everyone has their own story. I am no saint but try to be a good guy.

What I do need is motivation. I rarely make it 8 days past a positive habit or lifestyle change without relapsing and going back to the fap.

I hope this time is different.

I have the distractions ready. I have the barriers to porn in place.

23319,Question to NoFap,Masturbation makes the body weak: Myth or Reality?,"Let’s clear the confusion guys. I have been doing research around this topic for a while but  the web is confusing. While the majority of doctors describe masturbation to be perfectly healthy, a smaller percentage presents a safe masturbation frequency (i.e. after every two wet-dreams) and anything beyond that could weaken your body physically.

What has been the summary of your research on this? Is there any safe frequency for masturbation or is it healthy all together. I don’t obviously buy the fact that you can fap three times a day and be healthier and fitter than a guy who does it once a week.

I'm here to tell you what i think about Nofap, and whats really happened when i tried it. First of all, i heard the Nofap word when i was trying to find the answer of the question is ""Why the hell i'm afraid from girls?"". At that time, i was PMO almost everyday, so i said:""I have nothing to lose i'll give it a try"". After some relapses, i was able to do a 6months streak. At that period, for the first time ever in my shitty life, i had the courage to approach girls, i was so surprised to the point when i did the approach i walked all the way to my home repeating ""Hollyyshit! .. Holyshitt!.."". That was cool for a while, Untill i relapsed and started PMO again. Believe me i felt like a shit, i've got HOCD, Social Anxiety, Brain fog, unable to speak or even make a simple phrase.

But after few days, again that feeling came and the cycle went on. Now as today is my 8th day on nofap, I somewhat encountered that same feeling from the person I like.

23359,Journal Check-In,(Trigger Warning) Content restriction on iOS just saved my streak,"My last streak was 180d and this streak has been going well so far... 

I had been journaling, and it seemed completely relevant to the journal entry to mention my old two favorite uh... actresses of a certain type. 

Stupid, stupid, stupid. 

Just seeing their names written down was a trigger in itself, I haven’t viewed porn in 267 days. In the journal entry, I was trying to describe body types. In order to remember their types, I did search them on iOS. 

While I didn’t see any porn, I did see these actresses clothed. Before I knew it, my web searches were being blocked by my content restriction on iOS (the built in setting). 

Instagram was another trigger (no surprise there). Instagram is fucked! OMG I think in the process of writing this post I realized I simply just have to delete my account again. 

~

I literally just went to my computer and deleted my instagram *again*. 

So this is very stupid, but I think there was a vice health news instagram account I had browsed, and one of their image posts was a short article about... (cringes) how to properly measure your penis. 

I’ve been out of the world of being saturated by the internet for so long that my old trigger warnings didn’t activate...

So that’s specifically the search that was blocked by content restriction on iOS. It’s thought that the longer you abstain from PMO, the larger your member gets, so I searched average ***** size and that was totally blocked. 


But I also got sucked into my old favorite *actresses* she had retired from the pn industry and I saw on my search engine, Ecosia, that there was an internet rumor she had a kid since then. I tried opening another link related to her and was blocked by content restriction (thank God).

~

I realized even the presence of their names in my journal was a trigger, so I scratched out the paragraphs where I mentioned them. That really did help. 


But hell, this path is difficult. Worth it, but holy hell if I hadn’t activated content restriction, this streak may have ended. 

These are all so obvious in retrospect. I shouldn’t have gotten anywhere close to where I had been. 

~

This is a lot to reflect about...

I’ve always known that having my phone near my bed was a terrible idea. I decided to remove all web browsers from my phone for now, but I think I need to cultivate a practice where I have no technology at all in my bedroom at night. 

~

The good news is, there was no relapse. 
The bad news, I pretty much acted like an idiot last night.

I may need instagram and social media for my job soon, so I was thinking of getting a separate device for these accounts and keeping them in the office. 

For now, all I can do is continue to do my best, and push forward, cultivating this PMO-free NoFap life of mine. 

ONWARD TO VICTORY!

23370,Advice to NoFap,You'll never be 'over it',"This is something I hear a lot from 'recovering' addicts in AA, SAA, or the addiction recovery program, and it's not very encouraging. It makes it sound like I'm going to be flatlining every single day, and it's not ever going to get better. I've been there before, flatlining for a month, each night thinking ""It's going to get better,"" only to be met with the same or worse the next day. I just can't keep going like that, so I always break. However, this year I've made some significant changes that are really helping a lot, and I think I'm beginning to understand what people mean when they say this.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, the idea of 'getting over it' has been living a life where I'm doing so well that I don't even have to think about my addiction, and when arousing ads or other media pop up, I'm completely unaffected by it. I don't know if anyone actually lives like that; Perhaps people who have never been caught up in the addiction in the first place, but that is the life I will never live. It's when I begin to think that I'm finally 'over it' that I let my guard down and quickly find myself back at square one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I now strive for (and am starting to live) a preventative life where I wake up and think ""How am I feeling today? What potential threats will I face? How can I guard against or avoid them?"" and I am prepared to do this every single day, like a soldier, for the rest of my life, because I know that's what it will take to stay clean.

23384,Advice to NoFap,Obsessing over the nunber,"I think we all need to rewire what the stream number means . Yes it's a motivation and a good day to log how you're doing . But I think it's terrible for effecting people who have relapsed and how they then move forward again . If you want a month without pmo one fap won't destroy the benefits . It seems like resetting to zero is starting from ground zero of breaking a porn addiction and it's not at all . The weight of starting again makes you feel less likely to push through and break the addiction long term . When in fact if you went from once or twice a day to non for a month and just one slip up. You are much further forward in recovery than zero .

23454,Motivation,What NoFap Is Really About!,"Some treat it as a 90 day challenge. Some come here to get rid of a nasty addiction. Others come here out of desperation.

NoFap is so much more than just a challenge or beating one addiction. NoFap is the cornerstone of a life full of prosperity and wealth! It is about changing our whole lives, one step at a time, and NoFap is just the first step.

Observe the ones that have the longest streaks - they changed almost all of their bad habits and replaced them with good ones. If you keep everything the same and just try doing NoFap, let me tell you, you will fail miserably!

To really succeed in life we need to quit jerking off to porn, we just have to! And to quit jerking off to porn we need to change all the other little things that are wrong in our lives. Gaming for hours, Netflix binge marathons, drugs, alcohol, gambling ... All of that crap needs to go and be replaced with good stuff - Socializing with meaningful people, physical activity, reading (self help) books, working on our spirituality (meditation, yoga, mindfulness), eating healthy and so on.

Joining NoFap is a very good step, the first in many. That's not where the journey ends. We need to keep improving and growing. We need to turn around our whole lives if we want a meaningful change.

However it isn't long enough to forget what my life used to be like. 

It felt like edge of tomorrow, groundhog day etc.
Meeting the same people, going to the same place, doing the same things.

Even when I went someplace new or met someone new, it was the same feeling of numbness as ever. 

But it's different now, I'm smiling more, meeting exciting people and being social, things with family have been improving a lot, don't get pornographic images popping in my head anymore.

23487,New to NoFap,Starting NoFap journey,"Hey all!

This is me committing to the nofap challenge. I've made this account especially for sharing my journey, and I'll try to update this post whenever I feel I need to. In the end it'll hopefully be a journey through my nofap success story.

&amp;#x200B;

**A little bit about me and the situation**

I'm 24 years old and I've been (P)MO-ing for about 10 years I think. It started out without P, but curiosity got me going. Eventually it became a common thing, going as far as to download something on my PSP even. The content started out normal, but became more extreme as time went on.

I've been in a relation with PIED which lead to more problems then I'd like. In this relation I have stopped P and MO, and I noticed the timelines regarding quitting the addiction. However, when the relation came to an end I've fallen back to everything (though maybe not as extreme in some regards). I knew (P)MO was bad, though I kept telling myself 'well, one time can't hurt', 'MO is kinda healthy', etc, when I felt an urge, until the point when it became a common thing again.

**Why do I want to quit?**

Well, you've probably all read the benefits. And as mentioned above, I had issues regarding the addiction. I have been thinking (and wanting) to stop for a couple of weeks now. Reading the benefits again made up my mind; I really want to quit.

**Why did I create this account?**

For a few reasons. I like the idea to have a log about everything I've experienced, and I'd like to share my progress and thoughts, since any story can help someone. It'll also be a good extra motivation for me to stop, otherwise I'd be failing in front of a big community ;)

Feel free to ask any questions :)

Here we go:

&amp;#x200B;

**Night 1**

Might as well start off with the first night. It's not the first time I've started nofap or skipping a night because I didn't feel like it. Normally it would feel strange, like something is missing, not to (P)MO before sleeping. It got such a routine thing. Luckily, this night I was very tired and had no problems falling a sleep while skipping the routine.

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 1**

Waking up, I feel a minor urge coming up. It's not often I have urges in the morning, but skipping one probably causes this one to come up. Though it feels sensitive down there, it's no mayor temptation. I find this one easy to resist. Normally I'd pop it. Instead, I'll let it go and get ready for work.

Thinking back to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahwsin/a_pornstar_opens_up_sharing_some_of_porns_darkest/) also helps.

&amp;#x200B;

**Night 2**

This night I noticed how common it was to pop one out just for the sake of it. It was surprisingly easy to resist once again. Maybe because I really set my mind to it to stop instead of 'I should stop'. Though, since I usually just do it for the sake of it, maybe I didn't really have actual urges to begin with?

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 2**

Another workday, 15:00 - 23:00. I woke up without any urges.

During work, I was scrolling through instagram and tiktok. I came across some, lets say, 'nice' content. It got me hooked a bit, thinking 'watching this can't hurt'. Then I thought, well...  even if it indeed couldn't hurt, there is no real point either. Just making myself juiced up over nothing. I'd just make everything harder for myself. (Sidenote, I would never pop anywhere but home. I'd probably look it back up or something, if it was 'good enough')

On my way home, I was quite tired. I was thinking of going to bed, pop on out and go to sleep. Another realization moment how much of a pleasantry, common and routine thing it actually was. Thinking a bit further it was a way to relax and distract my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 4**

I've noticed I've been feeling way better since the day after I quit. More happy, energetic etc, and by pretty big amounts. In the evening I got a small urge, which again was quite easy to resist. I was thinking, what else could I do to give me a little reward or something?

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 5**

Today I came across some female nudity. I got carried away with it. I felt it in my D, though I didn't get a boner (only got my first random erection this morning, feels a bit... dead next to that), but I didn't MO to it. That was rather easy to resist.

There is something that frustrates me about this. When I was watching this, my head was pounding for a bit. 5-10 minutes later I stopped (since I felt this pounding coming), and then I felt a mild headache. Like my whole head got overflown with stimulus. I'm a bit worried that this causes some sort of setback. I've been feeling great the last few days and I don't want to loose that feeling. If not then I guess a relapse is not only limited to MO-ing. Learned a valuable lesson today.

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 6**

Feeling lots of tension down there. It's quite sensitive and pulsing, with a (slight) boner coming up every now and then. I don't find it hard to not give in, but getting a distraction is harder. Its like torture. Even if I do manage to find some, the tension keeps kicking back in. Feel a lil high off of it. Part of me does wonder, is it because of yesterday? I feel a bit worse then the days before, but that could also be because I did sleep that well. Other part of me thinks, it doesn't matter, just keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 23**

It's been a long time since I last updated.

The last 2 weeks I haven't had any real urges. Sometimes a minor one would pop up and go away in minutes. I didn't feel too good/happy overall. It was a down period.

One thing I am happy about: one time, when browsing insta, I came across a hot dance and I got a slight boner. That hasn't happened in a long time. It wasn't big, but it was something, and it made me happy. This was at day 16 or 18 I think. It hasn't happened after though.

The last few days I woke up with morning wood, which is a good thing.

Now the last 2 days, I had big urges. They were hard to ignore and kept coming back, especially when I was lying in bed. In there I would keep thinking about sex, women, etc. Boners would arise from those and I touched a few times. This means I need to grow stronger. The urges are annoying, but it does feel good to get a boner again, even if it's not super hard. 

Seeing women can get me a bit crazy, and even the slightest hot picture can get me wound up. Maybe I need to uninstall instagram and abstain from any other media that can get me off my path. It just feels good to get wound up...

I do think the real challenge will start for me now, since the urges only start to arise now.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ahymo1/starting_nofap_journey/

What's worse is that I also got a taste of how bad human trafficking is here in the US, so on top of my own problems I'm super depressed because of humanity itself. 

I couldn't sleep all night and at some moment was shaking and crying remembering the girl who got me started on this path. 

I'm going to go try to burn out my remaining energy at the gym, but I'm bummed and don't know what to do the next time it gets this bad.

In June I read Your Brain On Porn by Gary Wilson and quit for about 75 days. I did this without any community interaction. I then relapsed up to today.

Because I've been single in this time I've suffered many more adverse symptoms - social anxiety, depression, bitterness and resentment and have directed these feeling around my ex and a breakdown in the relationship with my Dad rather than the fact I've been watching porn.

 This time I want to reboot fully and permanently. I do Shamanic drumming and in a Trance Dance group last night I journeyed and my guides told me certain things that could happen to me to improve my life - moving back to a place where I was happy and where I have friends.

I believe that social media is nothing but a dopamine haven and nothing more. Instead of meeting girls in real life and starting relationships with people im sitting over here on the gram checking every 30 minute to see a girl post themselves for 100 likes and not having the courage to even text them because they have over 50 other people commenting and messaging them how hot she is, or instead of actually seeing people as regular human beings i see them either as nobody’s or as superstars with over 1000 followers. Point is, it’s unnatural and is going to change.

I’m deleting instagram as a whole because out of everything that’s the most useless app i have ever had and has no contribution to my life at this point at all.

Snapchat, i’m deleting everybody im subscribed to and if we arent friends or dont talk im either blocking your stories or unadding you.

Every day I check my cell phone and my computer to see which prostitutes are available and in which areas, masturbation is an old habit for me, I still practice it from time to time but I don't do it with pornography, I like to talk to prostitutes and listen to their voice, imagine how our meeting is going to be and spend hours selecting which is the best candidate. My urgencies are enormous and twice I have left work to visit a prostitute. Last year I started meditating and it has helped me a lot but it hasn't been enough, once I make a small glance at the pages where prostitutes are advertised there is no turning back, that same day or the next day I saw the pages I have to visit one to get rid of my urgencies. I have known this subreddit for a long time but I have never actively participated, I come here looking for help and trying to find people who have gone through a similar situation.

Inspite of trying for 3 months , I fail to have a streak which is more than 2 weeks. So today after relapsing to PMO, I really felt that I should share my struggle to stay clean with you guys.

So I have always been the shy introverted guy who sits at the back bench, who gets beaten up and bullied in school for no reason at all. No need to mention the awkwardness I felt in presence of girls. This is when I discovered porn at the age of 18. And soon it became my getaway from the social anxiety I faced  everyday. Everyday bad I had school/college I used to come home and watch porn. I had come across three girls, who were interested in me, who went out with me. But because of me being socially anxious and watching pornography on and off, I never had the courage to ask them out. Result-  I am still a unkissed, unhugged virgin at 24 years of my age. I have very few friends and my behaviour in social meetings and parties is very reserved and introverted . 

Professionally, I find it very difficult to put across my opinions or stubbornly stand for what I have said. Infact in meetings I find it extremely difficult to even form one sentence properly. Now, I am not saying that porn has caused this,  but pornography is a big reason for my social anxiety/awkwardness.

So the steps I am taking to improve my lifestyle -

* Completely abstain myself from Instagram /FB. (deleted my social accounts)
*  Joined the gym (never had the motivation before joining NoFAP, but now it seems an awesome decision)
* Mad a point to turn off every screen after 11 pm, and spend my time reading.
* I make it a point to meet at least one friend every week apart from my office colleagues. 
* Stop smoking.

I have in recent years i have improved a lot - got a fulltime job (so I'm occupied for most part of my day). Started playing guitar. Reading books .Mediate

23911,Journal Check-In,At the end of day 6 of current streak,"Today I had the worst urges of this streak so far. Even though they were just a few, I almost let them have too much control. Panic button was a real friend today as well. Also, my morning wood lasted longer than I remember it having lasted before.

Yesterday and today I noticed that it's easier for me to understand the maths stuff I study now. I wouldn't give all credit to nofap, although nofap probably contributes to it. In addition to PMO, I've been struggling with video game addiction for years, and now I've been dry from games for over 3 months. I think I can conclude that the combination of staying clear of gaming and PMO, and otherwise striving to ""stay in real life"" has finally showed some result on my studying too. In addition to that I've been more active irl, like I mentioned in my previous journal check-in, and I think it also contributes to the studying thing, as I've been using more of my ""free time"" studying/doing homework than before.

I'm so happy to see that Jesus has been helping me throughout the journey, that I'm growing more and more responsible each day, more and more adult each day, that I'm turning from a boy into a man, in my heart.

I've been thinking about my crush a lot lately. And I've seen that I'm not as much of a douchebag as I probably would've been some time ago when it comes to the possibility of her not liking me back. Like the thought of it makes me really sad, but doesn't make me want to fap, nor does it make me feel bitter towards her. I can see I'm more mature in this sense now. And I realize that my personal growth as a man isn't and shouldn't be tied to someone else: whether she likes me or not, I should strive to be a better person than I was yesterday. I should strive to overcome my addictions and problems for myself, not to please someone else. Of course less problems with myself contributes to my relationships, especially less PMO problems generally contributes to romantic relationships.

All these thought processes that have been going through my mind recently... they're weird... but wonderful at the same time. I feel like they're important to go through even though they aren't definitive. What I mean is that the thought processes don't define who I am or what I am like, but rather they help me observe, analyze and describe myself better.

24036,Telling my Story,I'm considering actually studying solutions for social anxiety,"Hello everyone...

I have had seasons with NoFap of generating effortless charisma, but it's been a long time since that's happened. I could be in an extended flatline...

I have some chronic digestive issues which I think cause a lot of brain chemical imbalances... While I am working on this, and am doing my best to address this, I do feel I've run out of patience with my perceived complete lack of social ease.

Have any of you heard of any good books or programs about overcoming social anxiety and becoming better socially?

\~

NoFap and NoPMO do help you gain greater clarity in life, and sadly, it seems that I'm getting clearer and clearer perceptions of my social failure.

If this is indeed true, then there's some silver linings, here. One is that the first step to overcoming a personal problem is to identify that you have a problem. Then accept it, then finally work to overcome it.

I'm an EXTREME intellectual. I did attend a tech bootcamp for a month, and in that environment, I was actually very popular among the student body of around 250 people. For the first time in my life, I might have been one of the most popular men there. Now I live among artists. I kind of stand for the opposite values as my peers, which has prevented me from making positive social bonds, but I \*know\* it's possible to succeed socially here, and not just succeed, but do amazingly while still keeping my own values and staying true to my self. 

\~

One thing that's helped me in the past was listening to the Art of Charm podcast. One commenter on this sub said that this was a bad move, and not honorable in a holistic way... The podcast, according to my own experience is just a program designed to improve your overall social abilities.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel I can't keep going like this. I feel like the being that in my development, I needed to be taught social skills, and it never happened perhaps, where for others it's much easier. I've had too much social failure in my life and I don't want to tolerate it any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

\~

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I've quit social media, especially instagram, and virtually everyone in my current community has a primary connection through instagram that dictates most of their social lives, what they talk about on a daily basis, etc. I've tried over and over again and simply cannot be on instagram because of the sexual triggers on the site. Regardless, I think there's a way to be successful socially in spite of this major difference between myself and most of my peers in my current social environment.

24061,Success Story,Hey no fap ive still been pmo frequently but ive felt the benefits of it through other channels heres my story.,"So basically ive done nofap before my highest streak was mid 30's and have definetly felt the withdrawals of porn as I was a heavy pmo addict. Ive felt the positive effects and this clear feeling. Nowadays I still watch porn but not like before. Its like a 2-3 weeks sort of thing.

Anyways Ive felt super clear starting this year but it wasnt from nofap. I started heavily training myself in everyway possible. I kinda imagined myself like a pokemon. I physically trained all 20 days so far since the year began. Ive gained 2 pounds of muscle and lost 16 pounds of fat. Ive finally fixed my posture thus fixing my breathing and back problems. I started taking care of my face and cleared about 90% of my acne. My face now glistens in the sunlight. I started reading tons of self help communication books to be able to talk to anyone. I broke my social anxiety and depression after 10 years. I can talk to anyone and any woman ;) super confidently now. Im able to hold myself and think presicely with style. Ive been traveling tons hitting a new place everyday. Been putting myself in unpleasant situations and talking to people I would have never approached. With my new found communication skills I became a big cat in the jungle. Im in the best shape of my life mentally and physically. It reminds me of the clarity nofap gave me but its like on crack. I have so much flow and happiness right now its insane. I feel like ive shot up 2 or 3 points on the scale man considering i thought of myself as a 6 or 7. Im no longer chasing im the one being followed. 

Imagine if i was also doing nofap. Ive tried and I plan to do a bit of condition Training and slowly lower my pmo intervals. Im also ready to get to dating again and I hope to find an awesome sexual partner soon. Lets fucking bag this baguette boys! Lets get it!

24080,Confession,My dog,"&amp;#x200B;

Life can be so crushing.

&amp;#x200B;

I was at my friend's party yesterday and when I came home early in the morning **I heard my dog breathing slowly and heavily**. As it was Sunday, there were no veterinarians working in my nearness and, sadly, I don't drive so I couldn't bring him anywhere farther away.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent my day talking to him, giving him so many treats and trying my best not to be overwhelmed by emotions. I did not sleep, I did not eat anything, I was sitting on the floor next to him the whole day and my day has passed by on so fast... It's midnight and he has finally fallen asleep. I still hear him breathing heavily, but I am sure that he feels a bit better.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still sitting here on the floor, writing with one hand, and petting my sick old dog who was in my life for the last (almost) thirteen years. And I started crying, I'm still crying listening to this [god damn music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Z7BY_igEw) for the second time so he can sleep easier and feel more relaxed.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember the last time I cried like this but I do remember all those times when I should have been more around him and more playful with him. **All those hours, days, weeks and months spent on masturbating, on things that didn't matter and people that didn't matter...** I would give all the things I have so I could have another month with him. I would spend much more time walking with him, petting him and more time just being on the floor next to him, laughing at his cute face and enjoying the beauty of life.

&amp;#x200B;

As I wrote these last few sentences, he calmly woke up and looked at me as if he knew that I was sorry for not being more around him. He licked my hand as if he told me that he forgives me, but I don't know if I will be able to forgive myself.

I don't know what I feel, and when he leaves me I will be all alone. I have my friends, my family, my brother but they wouldn't understand the tears and wouldn't understand what I'm going through.

The year 2018. was so hard for me, I don't know where to begin with 2019. I already PMOed enough times to be ashamed of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

And look at me now. Look at the great hero of PMO.

* **Where is he?**
* **Where is the hero that looks at porn all day long?**
* **Where is the hero that hates anyone that's more successful?**
* **Where is the hero that curses the world for not giving him a job?**
* **Where is the hero that's almost 26 and still a virgin?**
* **Where is the hero afraid to approach anyone new?**

He is here, sitting on the floor, crying at midnight and cursing the being for not letting him have another day with his dog.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: After going to the veterinarian I will have to put my dear dog down in few days, so I will make sure I spend them playing with him and giving him as much love as I possibly can.

I'm 17 y/o and I have been PMOing for around 3 years now. I was first introduced to P from mutuals who were discussing it, and thats when the issue began. It was never constantly on my mind but thats the start to any addiction as ignorance was bliss when I was unknowingly ruining myself. It only happened on occasion but obviously I craved more of this false happiness and it suddenly escalated to doing it every day since last year. After months and months of this corruption I started to feel drained of my emotions, excitement, motivation; every human characteristic that should give us life. Somehow I stumbled upon NoFap a few months ago and since then I have been trying to stop the cycle of PMO, but continue to fail. I'm trying to learn from every failure and error I make while trying to make a 90 day reboot, but so far my longest streak was 7 days. I hope to learn techniques from others here on how to stop and find an accountability partner. Any comments are always helpful.

Well, to be honest, I have been born with that. I mean everyone comes with that one special skill that is natural to that person. My skill is picking up on things super fast. I had lost it. It started coming back when I was noFap. Starting back up again today. Hope to go more than 9 days. I want to do like basically nofap for my entire life. Only  real actual sex with a woman.

Last night was a close call. I am starting to understand the mechanism of habit. It is unconscious. And due to the fact that I am writing about it, it is already allowing me to see that the mood oscillates between shitty and good. I've been repeating this mechanism for so long that it became my brain's default mode. It's gonna be *fun* undoing this habit and creating new ones. In the end, personal improvement isn't supposed to be a cakewalk.

A friend of mine once told me that it can get worse to a point there would be even days that you'd have massive hard-ons for no reason and days where your boner would just be dead. During my record 19 days ""fasting"" I had similar effects. Are there people in the r/NoFap community who experienced similar things?

I am thinking about adding new habits to complement this journey. Already writing is helping me cope tremendously with the withdrawal symptoms which are already starting (twitching and restlessness), but I am thinking about starting to practice meditation. Are there anyone who are in r/Meditation community to share any similar stories?

24407,Question to NoFap,PMO has been making me look completely different from my family?,"All my life or at least for a substantial amount of it, I've been deemed as the black sheep of my family.

How so? Though it's never been directly stated, it appears that the connotation of the words 'funny-looking' or 'unattractive' were always deeply associated with my appearance. Being around my kin tended to serve as a slap to the notion that I was never meant to find a mate. And if taken out of context, anyone could easily assume I wasn't even related to my family at all if I hadn't told them so (despite some resemblances  here and there).

 It was always, ""hey, I just needed to say that your siblings are so hot/cute"" or ""WTF?! you're related to them! NO FUCKING WAY"". Whoop. Whoop. There goes my already non-existent self esteem.

To add onto the bargain, it always came as a shock to others whenever I stated my nationality as Filipino after they'd conjecture that I was Indian. Like I'm not even mixed nor have a considerable fractional amount of it in me. Granted, I know that Filipinos are known as that one race that manifests in different ethnicities and appearances due to the history of colonization and such. But there was nothing more infuriating than people being in denial about me being Filipino or just dismissing it off as a joke because I just had to be that one Indian. And I have nothing against Indians, as I have lots of friends who are and indulge in variations of Indian food but it's gonna be so vexatious when others give off the impression of, ""yeah, sure you are"" or ""why can't you embrace your culture?"" around me after stating who I REALLY am. 

But when it really came down to the extrapolation, I couldn't blame anybody but myself. I have deep eyes, thick lips and a nose that traditionally looks of an Indian (or at least in this society). Not to mention that I do behold dark complexion in my skin.

24470,Motivation,"I fully support nofap, but don’t fall for the traps","I honestly forgot what day I’m on, and I don’t care to look, cause I feel like not looking makes the time go by faster. 

But anyways, I wanted to make some things clear to some people who are trying to get into nofap, and after looking at both sides of the isle, both nofap and people against, here’s what I got too say. 

Nofap is a mixture between bullshit and truth, and here’s why 

What isn’t true.

There are no superpowers :

Everything about superpowers is complete and utter bullshit, women do not become attracted to you simply because you don’t fap, there are no human pheromones that attract girls, at least none that we know of, and doing nofap isn’t going to turn you into a swole meat stick.  

Nofap increases testosterone permanently:

 This can actually go both ways. If anything, it actually might decrease your testosterone levels after a few weeks. Though it is true you T increases to 150% after 8 days, it returns back to normal not to long after.However, if you have wet dreams often when on nofap, there is a chance every few days, you have testosterone spikes constantly. 

What is true/half true 

Nofap can decrease anxiety and brain fog: 

I’ve played around with this and I can confirm, usually after a week of nofap streaks I lose most of my brain fog, and one problem I have is social anxiety, I am almost always thinking about how other people think of me,. But I’ve noticed that my anxiety usually relaxes on a long streak, and I don’t mumble and I don’t freak out when things go wrong in public. But this is only in my instance, it can be different for others.

Nofap does make you more attractable to girls(but not in the way you think it does)

Looks  are not enough to attract girls. I wouldn’t consider myself ugly, but I would say I’m a little above average looking, not stunning, but not completely unattractive either. The attraction comes from your personality change and your increased confidence. I’ve noticed that I usually talk better with women on nofap then when I’m not. And I usually talk to more people on nofap because I’m not scared to say something to somebody.  It’s all about how you act, if you act attractive, you’ll be attractive. But don’t try to be attractive, just go with the flow. 

Nofap eye shine and skin glow. 

Though it might be just placebo, I have noticed my skin isn’t as bad as it usually is when masturbating, that and I notice my eyes do appear more alive. Then again, I have better eye contact thanks to my decreased social anxiety, so looking more alive is probably because of boosted confidence. 

So in conclusion, nofap is both a whole lot of bullshit, but it can also be a whole lot of truth

I definitely recommend nofap for at the very least half a year, just.....don’t fall into the idea of superpowers, looking at it now, it’s almost like a cult.

24517,Telling my Story,3 years of failure with Nofap,"So guys. This is my first post here. I'm telling you my story of nofap.

In Jan 2016, I found nofap. I have been watching porn since 1st year of med school (yes I'm a doctor). So my first encounter with porn was at 18. Almost 11 years of porn addiction.

But I have been trying to quit for 3 yrs unsuccessfully. The longest streak I had was like 10 days maybe. Every time the same thing happens. I begin nofap, for the first 3-4 days I feel like superman. I feel like I can do anything. But after that on day 5 to 6 uncontrollable urges begin. I struggle for a day or two with these urges and eventually succumb to them. After this I usually go on a 3-4 day binge after which I'm sexually fatigued, depressed etc. Then a month later I try nofap again and the cycle repeats. 

The last 2 yrs have been hard because since I graduated I haven't been working. So I stay at home and study or do part time trading. But when I get lonely I immediately turn to porn.

I haven't dated anyone in the past year or so. My ex joined post graduation course and ever since then I have been single. Even when I was dating I would watch porn if I was alone even for a few days.

I am usually alone at home during week days because my roomies are all software engineers. Weekends I play football, go out. So I don't have the time to watch porn. But week days is the problem.

I wanted to ask you guys for tips. How do you deal with strong urges in the first month? Because the longer I'm on nofap the easier it becomes. I had a smoking problem. But I cut it down by 99% after quitting smoking for a couple of years.

I want to do the same with nofap. I was told that the urges become very easy to manage after a month or two.

P.S: I really appreciate all the nofappers, people like Gabe Deem &amp; YBOP. Thanks to these guys I understood how damaging porn addiction is. As a doctor I feel like every teenager out there needs to be educated on chronic porn use.

24547,Journal Check-In,Completed Day 1 - Looking for Advice,"Hi All, 

I am new to r/NoFap \- friend told me to check and sub to this subreddit  

First off, I am a 21 year old male who just went through the entire day without watching or looking at a porn video + image. I consider this a milestone. 

The mornings (and nights) are tough for me because thats when I wake up (I hop) on my bed with my phone and tap on safari (private mode) but I did not do that today :) 

I took the time to read some of the posts here and I must say you all are hilarious with your comments and inspirational with your posts and vice versa.

Hand to god, I don't even know why I haven't watched anything but I would like to continue this for as long as possible. My main reason for this: whenever I don't watch it, my testicles feel balanced and I really like the feeling of that haha. Is this a good reason to not masturbate? 

Not sure if this is a solid plan but I plan on writing another post when I complete:

1) A Week (27th) 

2) A Month (In Feb.)

3) A Year ( 2020)

To reach this, I was just wondering, what should I think or do throughout the day to take my mind off masturbation? 

Cheers!

24603,Telling my Story,Funny the little things that make you realize you need a positive change in your life.,"So I'm new here, and I thought I might as well tell my story of what made me decide to initiate a change in my life. Anyway, for the past couple weeks or so I've felt pretty lousy and everything's generally felt a lot more bleak and dull lately. *Coincedentally,* I had been fapping a lot more than usual recently. However, I didn't really put the pieces together until just couple hours ago. Long story short, after a couple days of trying to stay strong, I relapsed. However, I of course immediately regretted it. That feeling of regret ended up bringing me here, a subreddit I had ironically only found after searching for nsfw content in the previous weeks. And once I started reading these posts, and looking over those lists of results of excessive porn watching, something clicked, and those results started looking really familiar. Oddly enough, what most stood out to me at first was the habit's effect on gaming. As I went over the past few days, I found that on the days on which I had fapped recently, I had slower reaction times, my vision was dull and unclear, I hardly used my microphone and resorted almost purely to nonverbal communication with teammates, and I ragequitted more. While I've always heard of people referring to the physical effects of the habit, to see it spelled out so clearly and in a medium I understand so well really was what I needed to turn my life around. Anyway, I just wanna say that while there's a lot that can trigger you into making bad choices, you never know what can do the same to making good ones.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ai6qtq/funny_the_little_things_that_make_you_realize_you/
24609,Question to NoFap,Intuition,"I’ve always had strong intuition, it’s like a part of me. And during nofap it strengthens. 

I am writing here because nofap is a very open minded and understanding community.

An example of this is those YouTube videos teaching how to be confident.
I watch these kind of videos to learn why some people may act a certain way, but one thing I always hear in these is “you’ve gotta fake it to make it”.

Many people can’t see through these fake personas and fall for them easily, as heard when we are kids “puffed chest is confidence, smiles are friendly” etc.
We are trained to react what we see conciously.
But I might see someone irl greeting people as they walk confidently smiling and laughing - sometimes I get a strong feeling that it’s all fake and I see right through them while picking up on little signs of insecurity.
Other times I get a warm friendly vibe and think: wow this person and genuine and awesome.

I might not pick up on the signs when talking to a good liar, but I always hear my heart and gut tell me otherwise. It’s like a sense. It’s frequent and helps me tell the good from the bad, the real from the fake.

And because of all this I want to be a psychologist.

I’m sure I’ve had this since I was little. Is this all naturally part of me, or is it nofap powers?",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ai6saq/intuition/
24638,Journal Check-In,End of Day 1 Log,"Writing this log now feels unnecessary. Like it's a chore. ""Surely,"" says a part of my brain, ""You don't need it anymore. You've grown since last time. You'll be able to hold it off tonight.""

&amp;#x200B;

Hold off what, says me? You mean that little urge? The one you kind of don't want me to look at? The one that looks so weak? The one that says, ""Porn isn't so bad really"" and ""Maybe you can find better content this time""? Funny, how that little urge has grown before. Especially interesting how it's here after only one night of abstinence, almost as though that mental rut that I re-traced a couple nights ago is still fading.

&amp;#x200B;

Good thing I made myself write this log anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Today and yesterday kind of sucked. This is a long weekend for me. Less work &amp; school means more time when I'm either sitting alone in my room or walking alone around the area. Not a lot of FPM (fantasy-porn-masturbation) temptation, just a severe lack of activity and social interaction. I seem to have two kinds of days: stressful/anxious work days, and sit-around what-am-I-doing-with-my-life days. Frankly the former seems to be better for as long as I can take the stress and anxiety. I do need to get that issue resolved though, since it's also unhealthy. New challenges!

&amp;#x200B;

My current goal is to get through this week with NO FPM. Very minor allowances to be made for fantasizing as there's only so much control I have over my mind.

I tought it couldn't be helped and that I would have to wait for NoFap alone to bring my energy back but that is incorrect, this is a note I made for myself in the future:

Note #1

""Exercise and activity keeps you from feeling tired. Inactivity and stimulation does the opposite.""

The problem was that I spent too much time after my work mindlessly browsing internet and watching youtube. As soon as I got up and started doing some pushups that tiredness dissapeared. And then I topped it off with a cold shower which sealed the deal and I could go on. That's it, I hope this helps.

24821,Question to NoFap,Day 68... WHAT AM I DOING WRONG??,"So I'm 19 and I've been going fairly strong with my nofap journey (hardmode) and haven't relapse at all:) This alone is a major improvement for me. I also have slowly began to develop a routine that seems to be working. I workout often... a lot easier during weekdays. This definitely seems to be helping level my emotions and lessen the mood swings. I've really been trying to cutback on other substances such as alcohol and weed as well. This seems to be a little more of a challenge for me because being in college these things are so integrated into the environment of social life. I have limited myself to drinking only on the weekends but this just seems to make me feel super lazy the days after the fact. Despite it feeling like I have less social anxiety, I still very rarely talk to strangers and feel quite awkward with social interaction. I know socializing is something I should be trying to improve on at this stage in my journey but it normally leads to me getting involved with substances. Therefore, I have become quite a recluse for the time being... primarily because it has been the most effective way to not indulge myself with other addictive substances. I've been in a flatline since the first week of quitting pmo and I still feel quite numb overall (nothing seems to give me joy when I'm sober). I'm hoping my suspicions of me coming out of the flatline are true... as I've been waking up more frequently with morning wood and have spontaneous erections (mostly at night). None of these erections were caused by thinking/fantasizing of hot girls though:( I think of attractive women I see around campus and still cannot seem to get hard from it:/ One of the biggest accomplishments so far into my journey was when I was able to actively seek out and talk to this absolutely gorgeous girl in one of my classes. I was able to get her snapchat and even went on two dates with her! Unfortunately because my addictive porn habits fucked up my brain so much over the years, both of the dates felt very awkward and I was overcome with anxiety (completely caught up in my head). I even was able to make-out with her a couple but I made is as awkward as possible (didn't even get hard I was so nervous)... as you can imagine. (fyi: this girl hasn't contacted me in over two days after saying she was busy on Friday. I know it's because I acted super weird and awkward as fuck.) I just wish social interaction came natural to me as it seems like I've still got a long way to go. Even though I feel like my brain is healing from pmo, why don't I have the confidence everyone else claims to get from nofap?? Why can't I just be myself and enjoy talking to a beautiful girl without being completely overcome with anxiety?? I've been working out, started writing in a journal, and even have been trying meditation but I still definitely do not feel like myself. All the nofap stories I read are so discouraging because it seems as if everyone reaps all of the positive benefits of nofap (majority of them way soon than day 68). What am I doing wrong?? I just want to see the light at the end of the tunnel and I've gotten a lot better at dealing with depressing mood swings and emotions with patience. Even so... I'm just scared I'll never turn into the confident human being I know I'm capable of being so far along into the journey already. Any input is greatly appreciated -- much love

24901,Advice to NoFap,Combating urges,"Here goes, this advice is mainly aimed at those new to this. The urges that are hardest, well for me, are the little mental ones, they’re the ones that persist throughout the day. I’m going to run down how I deal with them even when I have nothing to do, or am sat at my desk (work reasons).

First off, big urges where you’re like struggling to not get a boner are easy to deal with. Walk away, move around and just generally focus your mind on something else.

The mental urge that continues is effectively just a lie that you tell yourself. To combat these you need to fill your mind with distractions. Let’s say you’re working at your desk, but you’ve got multiple pieces of work, start a new one, switch it up, take a coffee break (I mean I’m a caffeine addict so I should probably stop that as well) walk around, and have people around you. I doubt you would fap if you knew there was a chance of someone walking in on you, and it just adds accountability. You also need to remind yourself how much of a waste of time it is to fap, tell the truth about it to yourself and stop lying to yourself. Just once won’t do any harm is NOT the right thing to think, instead think of all the things you could do instead. I am not saying however, that if you do mess up it’s the end of the world, just try again, but work even harder

24912,Other,Depression leads to fapping. Fapping leads to depression.,"It's recently dawned on me that I might be chronically depressed. I suffer from anxiety too, usually feeling symptoms whenever I'm incredibly out of my comfort zone, have lack of sleep, or if I'm genuinely worried over something seriously life affecting. Which is more often than I'd like it to be.

So anyway, I've been feeling like I do for as long as I remember, which is why it took me so long to realise: Wait other people experience life differently to me? I've been fapping since I was 10, so I think I exhausted my brain leading to and during high school, to the rock bottom I'm in now.

I've done some dumb shit, and continue to do dumb shit, so I'm not blaming my depression solely on fapping; but if I was an eunuch my life may currently be far more rewarding than it currently is.

I just wanted to say that. 

I'm eighteen years of age. I have a full time job, and have a hobby learning to write and tell stories. I have four friends that I talk to every week or so.

24941,Advice to NoFap,The power of Habits,"Boys (and girls), habits are a powerful thing. If you are on here, it is because porn was a strongly emphasized habit in our life, and therefore it is hard to quit.

Reorder your room, use your laptop only in a public place, form another habit during that certain time of day to replace a cue.

24974,Advice to NoFap,"Sometimes, you DO fap for more than boredom. It's also a coping mechanic.","For the longest time while I fapped, it was to cope with my life. I'm 15, homeschooled, and am trapped with my psychotic adopted siblings. (For an example of how insane they are, my younger brother once got in an argument with my other brother, so he snuck into his room, snapped his rabbits neck, and hid it under his pillow). Combine that with my OCD, ADD, anxiety, depression and Aspergers, and it was just too much. I rather subconsciously turned to fapping to help cope with all of it. It couldn't affect me if I felt nothing, right? 

I don't know. I just see all these posts about how ""you're fapping out of boredom"" and that just isn't true. There are other reasons to fap--maybe you have to cope, maybe you are hiding from something, or perhaps you are doing it simply because it feels good. And I'm not dissuading the idea that you fap out of boredom, there certainly are people who do that (thankfully, I have slowly become one of those people), but if you are fapping a lot, maybe it means there is something in your life that is distressing you, greatly, and you need to take care of yourself a little bit :)",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aia7k4/sometimes_you_do_fap_for_more_than_boredom_its/
24980,Relapse Report,"Yesterday I relapsed but this ain't gonna be some, I feel like crap kind of post","Hey everyone, since accountability has been one of the values I've wanted to keep in my life, I'm here before y'all my fellow fapstronauts to make myself accountable, I was on a 62 day streak and I was playing with fire, I was all like,"" ok I'm 62 days in, nothing will make me give in"" but something I didn't quite remember was that sexual desire if something natural from the core of the human being so I started going on insta and saw some triggery pics which I should not for starters, so I ended up researching something I should've not

I lost my humility and forgot why I was on this journey, which is to be the best version of myself for me, my future wife and my future children
After the relapse, my brain decided to punish me so I binged a bit, which made me realize I wasn't healed yet, and that I should not take it for granted.

Sure I let myself down, but I'm not perfect, not gonna go to hard on myself but not gonna go soft easy either, made the decision to not fap again ever, it sure doesn't bring any good, and I bought a white board were I could write some sentences to remind me what made me choose this path so If I ever get tempted to drive myself off of it, I'll remind this and never set myself up for failure again

In the same day I took action to prevent future failures, don't give up, you sure will fail but from failure their's learning to be made, so don't take it too hard but don't go easy either, recognize why you failed and make an effort to not fail again

25008,Advice to NoFap,It all comes down to your mindset threshold about nofap...,"365+ days chiming in to help struggling brothers and sisters.

The  sub already has lots of specific tips and techniques that are important  to implement and will help you in your nofap journey. The more you  implement, the easier nofap will get, period. Just throwing a few of  them: exercise, cold showers, meditation, minimizing unhealthy food,  quality sleep etc (all positive habits that will improve your life, not  just help with nofap.) All of these help with your health and mindset,  all the positive chemicals produced from these habits will help you in  the nofap fight (did you notice when you're tired, it's more likely  you'll relapse?)

What I want to share with you is not another tip  or technique but the stage of your mindset about nofap. This will  ultimately decide whether you make it to the other side or not.

Depending on which stage you're at, we can probably guess if you will make it or not.

So here are the mindset thresholds: (You will know on what stage you're at.)

**Just ""trying"" level**

At  this stage, you will never make it, even after 100 tries (unless you  change your mindset and grow to the next level). You won't make it  because you don't care enough. Do not underestimate PMO. It has been  programmed in your brain and body for so many years so that a weak  mindset such as ""I want to try nofap because I know it's bad"" won't make  you succeed. You're stuck in 1-20 days.

**I want to succeed level**

Slightly  better but still impossible to succeed. You dislike pmo and are aware  of the benefits that nofap can bring you, so you want to do nofap and  wish you could quit. Unfortunately, this is still not enough to quit  pmo. You might make it to 10-30 days. But you'll eventually relapse and  never take complete control over pmo. Many people want to master nofap,  many people want to quit smoking or want to have best grades in  school... but wanting is not enough to make definite changes for your  life. You need more power.

**I MUST succeed!! level**

Now  we're getting close. MUST is on a whole another dimension from first two  levels. In MUST succeed!! stage, you don't have any second-thoughts  about the benefits of nofap, and you're SICK AND TIRED of yourself for  doing pmo. You're already implementing some tips and techniques and  implementing a few additional healthy habits. You already have some  ""superpowers"". You make it to over 30-90 days or even 100-200 days. But  still you're not completely over PMO. That bastard is still hiding and  lurking somewhere within you and it will strike when you let your guard  down.

**I** ***can't imagine myself*** **continuing living as such a  pathetic and weak person who does PMO because I have a better vision of  my future self. level**

This is the stage that will make you take  full control over PMO. Once you reach this stage, even if you're day 1,  you've already won. After 300 days you don't even count days anymore  and it's not even in your mind. *Can't imagine myself* means that in your mind, a life living with PMO is not even worth living. In other  words, your one life is too precious to be living as an sub-optimal self.  There are two critical components to this stage...

First: You  already have an identity shift. ""You"" are no longer a person who does  PMO. ""You"" as in your identity has already shifted from a persona who  can do PMO into a persona who quit for good definitely without any  second options. Things are clear, it is clear to your mind and your body  that you're not the same person as before, you're simply a person who  doesn't PMO, period.

Second: You have an EXCITING vision for  your future self. You ~~want to~~ must be happy. You must be successful. You must  have a loving family. Those could be your goals for the future and you  won't take no for an answer. Anything you imagine as visions or goals  for your future. You're already working hard to realize those visions.  Does PMO have any place in these grand future agendas? Not even 0.0001%.  You're striving on personal development. The ""superpowers"" that you  gain (partly) from nofap and partly from all other positive habits (and  quitting other bad habits) are a necessary component to your happiness  and you have no other option but to realize this.

\--

I believe everyone passes through first stages with lots of reading, struggle, more reading and getting help from other members and most eventually reach the MUST succeed level after becoming so sick and tired of one's pathetic  self. This stage is already amazing. But if you want to reach the final  stage, you need a paradigm shift in your identity. You have to grow from  your past self into a new person that you always wished to be.

I'm guessing we all get days when we haven't fapped in a long time and our minds are so desperate for their fix, they will obsess over anything to get us to mess up. But how harmful is it towards my progress? 

For the record I have had erections on and off all day and a considerable amount of precum leakage. It feels like my fantasies have jumped from one subject to the next, as if my mind is trying to figure out what works lol

25119,Telling my Story,"I wanted to do this a few days ago but didn’t have enough time so here we go, why I started nofap and my story (I do get personal here)","So to start off I’m 15 close to 16 and have been doing PMO ever since I was 10 or 11. Ever since I was very young I was fascinated by pregnant women so I guess when I started to PMO it was my first choice of porn (and I only looked at stuff on google images and not even look up videos). What’s funny is when I would masturbate I wouldn’t even do it right, I had underwear on and would like twist myself side to side. My parents caught me after a few months after I started and took away almost all of my electronics and banned my internet access on stuff like gaming systems for nearly a year and my mom told me that if she caught me again I would never get my stuff back, and we are Christian so we think masturbation and premarital sex is wrong but we aren’t super religious even though I plan on waiting to have sex. So during the roughly 10 months I had almost nothing to do I would always jerk off in or right after I got out of the shower (and I could actually do it right this time) because those were my most private times and I would always just imagine people (call me weird but if anyone in my family was pregnant I would just use them to masturbate to), and I’ve done it in the shower recently and when I orgasm my heart rate goes up so fast and I hated that feeling so I don’t do it in the shower anymore. So when I got my stuff back you could probably imagine how excited I was to finally be able to watch porn again and it was so much better. I was always super scared about anyone looking through the history somehow so I always found a way to get to certain websites through twitter so it wouldn’t go in my history (at least I think). So I did that for probably a year or two. I’ve tried to stop a few times but would end up giving in after roughly a week, the longest I lasted was about 2 weeks. I always felt guilty about PMO because of my faith but I just couldn’t stop because it felt so good. I also thought I was addicted but I discovered some subs to talk about stuff on and I came out about my problems and it made me feel so open about it so I started talking about it a lot on reddit (because I felt more comfortable talking to strangers rather than my family because if I told one person in my family everyone would know eventually). So then I found nofap and wanted to give it a try and I discovered that everyone in this community was super nice and supportive which only made it even better. And I found out a lot of people on here are around my age which supersized me and made me feel proud that people like me are trying to kick this nasty habit.

25176,Motivation,I am SO FUCKING DONE WITH NEGATIVITY,"\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR**; FUCK negativity. FUCK negative people. FUCK living by other people's standards. FUCK living your life by ""WHAT IF"". FUCKING LIVE YOUR LIFE YOUR OWN WAY. Love yourself always and leave people who don't serve you behind. A life focused on the ""what if"", is not a life worth living. I'd rather die.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been feeling really happy these past few days. It feels like i've resolved a few negative beliefs and moved forward in general. **It feels like i've come to accept myself for who I am**.

For too long, I've been running from myself, trying to please others. I've been lost. I thought the path forward was to succeed. I thought happiness would come from getting buff... From getting rich. From going on nofap. I thought these things would fix my life- make me happy. No. That wasn't it. The problem wasn't all these ""things"" in my life. I had **conditioned** myself to think that **there was something wrong** and **I needed to fix it**. My realization came in the fact that **there is nothing wrong**. **The only thing that is wrong is how I see the world**. I needed to find myself. I'd been ignoring what **I** wanted for far too long, only focusing on what others wanted and expected from me. I never realized that's what I was doing but it made me **FUCKING MISERABLE**.

I had conditioned myself to think ""I WILL BE HAPPY WHEN..."". I made a choice a few days ago that it ends now. **I ALREADY AM ENOUGH. I ALREADY AM HAPPY. I ALREADY LOVE MYSELF. MY LIFE IS ALREADY AMAZING.** Coming from this point of view, I can then go out and make the things THAT I WANT happen.

**So here's what flipped me off today...**

Before interviews I always like to drink 1 glass of wine to relax. Think it's weird, think it's dumb, I don't give a fuck. I like to do it. It works for me. For my first interview with this company, I told my father that I had gone to buy some wine for pre-interview. He told me it was a bad idea and that **WHAT IF** they notice it on my breath? **I'd be fucked.** Sure he's right. But i'll just brush my teeth and grab a mint and it'll be fine. After all, there's about 1 hour between my drink and my interview. So the first interview goes well. Now as I joke with him about wine pre-2nd-interview, he says the same thing again. **WHAT IF?** **WHAT IF THEY NOTICE MY BREATH? You'll be fucked.**

You know what? **He's probably right**. But what is this **CONSTANT FUCKING FOCUS on WHAT IF?** This **constant fucking focus on all of the negative shit in life**. WHAT IF things go wrong? WHAT IF you fail? **Why do we always have focus on the negative things?** Why can't we focus on the fact that it's a hilarious thing to do?

25217,Confession,I was NoFap veteran with a streak of over 309 days two years ago… since then I've been relapsing over and over again. I'm done.,"Hey guys, 

This is a post I never thought I would make but, here I am. This is gonna be a long one, so I suggest you pull out a seat for this one. I'm gonna let you know how I got my streak, what went wrong, and what's next for me.

&amp;#x200B;

# How I got my streak

In my teenage years, like all of you, I was exposed to pornography. At the time, because no-one would inform us about the harm that it causes to our lives, I continued watching it, till my college years (I'm in my senior year now). However, I used to go for Christian teen camps, and they would always have a separate session just to talk about the harms of P. Problem was, it was already too late. I was addicted. But, I did start to try to break from my addiction albeit terribly. As years went by, I noticed the effects it had on my physical, mental and even spiritual health. I was a nightmare of a kid to my parents. My teachers always talk about how much potential I had and I had to do was work on my skills. Yet, for some reason, all I needed to hear was that I had potential, and I was satisfied with just that. I don't care if I fail in life... at least everyone knows that I'm capable of something greater. If someone didn't think so, yeah… that's when I would actually put in some work. After that though; nah. It's not worth the effort, they already know what I'm capable of doing.

In 2016, I finally moved away from home for pursuing my engineering degree. That's when I noticed how pathetic my life became. I noticed how much I could've achieved and life is so much more than just setting other people's bars high for you. All I did was majorly screw up my life and net result of that was me getting picked on (for good reason, I always used to take insults super seriously), having little to no social skills– even though I was an extroverted person, and so on.

In August (you can see this from [a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/5fbuuk/how_i_overcame_porn/)) 2016, I took a step to take my life seriously, and since then it felt like my whole neurological makeup at that time changed. Cause there were a lot of times that I stumbled upon porn by mistake (like, some guy I followed on Twitter for jokes starts uploading these h-pics as well) it didn't phase me at all.

I felt invincible.

My life became so much better. I became the most popular (and sought after) guy in college, became in charge of a lot of things, I took initiatives in making good and worthwhile habits (going to the gym regularly, reading books daily, brain exercises, etc.). 

I discovered this subreddit by accident 2-3 weeks into my streak, and it was one of the biggest motivators for me in my streak. I don't think I would've reached that far into it if it wasn't for this sub. 

&amp;#x200B;

# When things started spiraling out of control

My elder sister finished her studies during my second semester of college and she was staying in my place. At the time, I used to not watch any YT videos with cussing and I had good friends who didn't necessarily agree but encouraged me to do that (they were from my hometown, though). My sister, however was the polar opposite of me. I used to sleep at 11 and get up by 6 (Classes would be at 9AM). My sister would sleep at 4 and get up at 10 or even 11AM. She watched a lot of videos with cussing and I used to always get put off by that. 

Thing was, her habits started seeping into my life. I started watching more videos with cussing. I stopped some of my good habits cause those videos ate my time. There would be a lot of triggers (Borderline P content), but as I told you, I was completely desensitized to it. I started to sleep later than usual. I stopped reading the Bible. I thought it was fine, cause I'm now immune, right? 

But then, I started reading erotic literature, still no M though, I used to keep myself clean that way. Then, as you guys could guess, *that* led me to a downward spiral. It wasn't that quick, though. Remember, I was basically not an addict at that point. I started reading that stuff more and more; I then went a step further and moved to those choose-your-own-adventure stories. And then, the ads on those websites made me completely relapse. I hadn't touched myself but sat up till 4-4:30 reading the stories, but more importantly looking at the ads that came up on those pages (I had actually inverted the colors on my phone so I wouldn't be turned on by the images; but over time, I started to intermittently switch it off and back on to satisfy my ""curiosity""). But eventually, I jzzed in my pants.

I woke up the next day super guilty and super tired, at 6:30 with just 2 hours of sleep (almost a year streak). But again, I wasn't an addict… not yet. I took a vow to not read or look again. 

I had yet another streak, 115+ days, and then, relapse. 90+ days after that, relapse. 90 days, 80, 3 weeks, 1 week, 4 days… then daily. I'm now stuck between 4 days and 1 day streaks. I eventually stopped visiting this sub cause it reminded me of how bad my addiction was (plus the memes didn't help at all), watched more and more YT, and stopped caring about my life. And all those channels that watched kept on relating to P like as if it's completely normal and that sort of reinforced my thoughts against P and this sub. 

&amp;#x200B;

# I'm done.

I was so afraid of opening up about my re-addiction (I don't know what else to call it, lol) cause during my longest streak, I was so vocal about my addiction and how I got over it. A lot of people confided in me, and because of that, I bottled this up in myself, for the longest time. Although I'm still popular and I have a lot of skills, and more, P is ruining so much of my life.

So, I'm done. I was so addicted to these YT channels; I knew that they ruined and were continuously ruining my life, yet I held on to the belief that I still had some of that ""immunity"" left in my system. I made a new YT account, and I'm only subscribed to the channels that help my life out.

I've been reducing my phone addiction like crazy (used to spend 11h somedays on YT alone), started reading more books, developing apps, reading the Bible more. 

I'm not going to wait for another miracle. It's time I come face-to-face with reality and own up my mistakes and admit that I'm not immune anymore. I am an addict. Not anymore.

25218,New to NoFap,Does NOFAP really increase penis size for people who don’t let their muscles relax down there for jerking off excessively ?,"What I mean by excessively is 10 or more times a day which I something I’ve been doing ever since I was 13 and I haven’t seen a change in my penis size or girth and I’m almost 20....I’ve heard that people around my age or younger have stopped jerking off for a number of weeks and months and they’ve seen a change in their penis length wise cause they stopped masturbating too much. 

I’m a firm believer that excessive masturbation is a real thing. When you masturbate too much you’re releasing too much testosterone and testosterone plays a major part in making your thing grow. Another reason why I believe it is because it makes sense you’re not letting the tissue and muscles around your penis have a lot of time to relax and breath and let them do their job. I don’t think it’ll work for people who are done with puberty though. Once you’re done growing I think that is it if you’re a late bloomer in your mid twenties or you’re in the age range of when puberty starts and ends it’ll most likely work. 

Everyone is different so it’s not like we’ll grow a porn star penis it’ll just finally be able get to the length that it was supposed to when we were 13-15 years old. I’m 2 inches (almost 3) flaccid and 4 inches erect with no girth so I would be SOOO happy if I stopped and 3 months later Im 5 inches flaccid and 7 inches erect with some girth. I’m thinking realistically instead of thinking I’m gonna get a 7 inch flaccid penis and 9 inches erect surgery is needed (most of the time) for that. I would stop but omg it feels so good and it releases so much sexual tension and you feel relaxed afterwards. I tried last year..failed.....I tried it for new year..but again failed after an hour of being off of masturbation. 

I also believe that penis enlargement creams and pills are full of shit, just saying. They’re dangerous to cause you don’t know what’s in those pills the seller isn’t even specific with what kind of ingredients were used to make them so if you’re thinking about using penis enlargement pills I wouldn’t if I were you...

I’m not saying masturbation is a bad thing it’s a healthy way to explore your body and release sexual feelings but if you do it too much it can have some I wouldn’t say consequences but some affects that can make you question if there is something wrong with your penis.

25234,Relapse Report,What Happen after Relapse (improvement),"I had relapsed yesterday, due to ""Inejaculation"" after sex. This means I had made a conscious decision to fap in order to release the abdomen pressure built up, to prevent semen backflow. I didnt felt regret, because while I was opening up my browser, my dick was soft, I had to basically force myself to get hard in order to fap... It's a very weird feeling I tell you.

Now a day has gone by, I think my libido is already back to normal, I don't feel the urge to edge or even touch myself the WHOLE day! That's new, because back when I first started NoFap, the first day is HELL! I used to fap daily and the break was excruciating I remember. But strange enough, today the first day in I have never felt more alive, because I am so confident I will NEVER relapse again! 

From today onwards, if I were to have sex with a woman again, I would bravely tell her my problem, and settle it right on the spot instead of repeating my mistake. I know I'm in Standard Mode instead of some of you that are on Hard Mode, but that's the decision I'm going with.

The day was just lit for me only 2 days of NOFAP  but i could witness and feel the good things taking place for me. Like each and every person i know in my college were very much attracted to me and i had a new self confidence and boost in my energy levels.

But today suddenly a very strong urge to watch some certain porn scene attacked me. I was about to open a website thinking „just a minute or two watching it” but then my rational thinking turned back on and I realized that if I do it then I’ll inevitably end up binging and wasting all my progress.

So, I grabbed keys and literally ran away from home. I didn’t take my mobile phone with myself because I was afraid that I might lose control and end up watching porn on it outside. I was walking for about 15 minutes until the brain surrendered and the urge left.

I feel so bad and enervated on that day that I don't study for that whole day thinking that I am feckless now and my mind craves dopamine and wouldn't at all like to study.

So. That way, that day and the day next to it are wasted, I again start my streak after watching a lot of motivational videos and quotes, but also hate myself and my mind for thinking that this is another one of your bullshit resolution/start that is gonna end in a binge session and then again you will temporarily make your mind up and this way I feel I fuck up with my conscience and value system.

25464,Telling my Story,Having a hard time not to break my streak (XL),"I accidentally started nofap on January 7th. So this is day 14 but i am not going as strong as i did in the first week.

So that monday two weeks ago i was hella exhausted in the Morning, so i decided (against all odds) not to fap before going to work.
When i came back home i also had stuff to do so there was just no time.

The next day i realized what happened: a full day without fapping.
I was so motivated, that i used this running start to begin my first serious attempt of nofap since at least half a year.

It just felt so weird, because usually i'd set a day when i would stop fapping and prepare by purging my porn accessibility.
Not this time, i have everything still at hand. The whole collection of pics on the phone, all the subreddits i have subscribed, yada yada yada.

It takes a lot of control to not ""just take a small peek for god ol' times sake""
But i know, this is my addicted brain trying to hook me.

On the weekends i see my girlfriend, so i get to have some relief. I already noticed how i don't last as long as i am used to; orgasms are so much more fulfilling; i feel more during sex, both physically and emotionally. The whole experience feels so much richer. I even managed to cum from a Blowjob in reasonable time.

 But... (Of course theres a but) lately it is getting extremely hard not to relapse...
Today especially.

I browsed reddit during some free time at work and came across some triggering posts... I was too intrigued and looked at them...
And i could feel how the urge to fap became overwhelming, so i was considering to just say fuck it and do it when i come back home.

The whole Drive home i was salivating over the idea to just get back at it again once im home.

But when i came in i decided to just do my chores first and then do it as a reward.
After i was done with that i was reconsidering...

""Maybe i should check in with r/nofap just to be sure""
And after reading some time i was filled with more determination to stay strong again.

So yes, i did not do it. I kept control, even though i was ever so close to do it (even with some undeserved pride to fap again)

And i achieved this (ironically) through procrastination, so that i made myself do important (and thus fulfilling) things beforehand.

25536,Advice to NoFap,Trigger Tip,"During my time of NoFap I never understood what my trigger was until now. For me it was when I was laying in bed and I was watching TV or something. Once I got really comfortable, the urge to PMO would just be very strong. 

To combat this urge, I now make my bed every morning and that makes me not want to lay down and mess it up again, therefore allowing my urges to remain at bay. So if this is one of your tiggers I recommend trying this out. 

Hope this helps and remain strong 💪.

Mostly because I am still readjusting to being more proactive with my life and decision making. But on the 7th day I struggled mostly because I was having thoughts of relapsing all day and I was in a brain fog, but thankfully I came out victorious against my urges. The day after I had realized that I had been in a better mood and didn't want anything to do with touching my genitals or watching pornography because after so many times I'd end up beating myself up for it afterwards. Then I remembered that I had also blocked all of the adult websites on safari and this also gave me a huge confidence boost and helped me realize that I was on the right track for myself and the future decisions I need to make. Yes I know I have ways to go and have only been 8 days clean but honestly joining the fapstronauts was one of the most critical and well thought out decisions I've ever made to progressing my social and abundant mindset.

3) so what when provoked ?
        Many of the fapstronauts will suggest me what to do here is exercise but I have finded out a better solution for it , it is power of god - Prayers . That helps a lot. Maybe I can use methods that can help me to feel orgasm without ejaculating but I failed . One day when I read bible when I got an urge until it's fully gone .

25785,Motivation,"I thought NoFap was complete, utter bullcrap. Then I went to the gym.","I went to the gym with my mother today. I had the day off of school, and I had nothing better to do, so I figured I'd at least get my workout in for the day. 

I saw something incredible. There was this girl at the gym, and holy crap she was hot. And I mean hot like “puts Elizabeth Olsen to shame” hot. I didn't go up to her, because I was too scared. I've heard horror stories of guys who tried to hit on girls at the gym. It never ends well.

Well, along came this guy who clearly had nothing to lose, goes up to her and compliments her, and she loves it. She falls head over heels for him, the man knew how to hold a conversation. It wasn't even about anything big, it was about freaking food and college. But he was able to do in 5 minutes what I couldn't do for the past 6 years. There's no way on Earth that he knew her or that they were a gym couple (we all know *those* people). He just went up and did it. I'm pretty sure they exchanged numbers, and I'm willing to bet my ticket to Avengers Endgame that they'll be dating soon. 

Every time I tried to do something like that, it always ended terribly. The girl would never react the way this girl did. In the past, the most I would get was an awkward laugh, and maybe her number if she felt bad enough for me. I've never had a girl ask me for my number, a date, or even a hug. 

I thought long and hard about it while freshening up in the locker roon. Why on Earth are my dating skills as bad as they were 6 years ago? Am I too nerdy? Impossible, even the nerds at my school got girls, hot ones too. Am I not funny enough? Even guys with the personality of a rock can get a girl to fall for him. I've seen it before. 

No, I think I know bloody well why. Why all the other guys at school can get a girlfriend in 5 minutes and I can't even get a number. It's all because of porn. 

I first discovered porn 6 years ago. I thought it was the greatest thing ever. Hot girls at my beck and call, with no possible chance of rejection? 6th grade me was thrilled! 

But those 6 years of porn completely screwed me over. Now, every time a hot girl walks by, I freeze up and lose all sense of emotion. In the morning after a night of PMO'ing, I always felt drowsy and cranky, but I just assumed it was because I didn't sleep well. It wasn't sleep that was the issue, it was porn. Porn left me desperate for hot girls, and we all know girls can smell desperation from a mile away. 

I need to kill this before it kills me any further. I've been a victim to this for 6 years. That's 6 years of bad habits that I have to break out of. This will not be easy. I will more than likely fail over and over. But I have to, otherwise when I get to college, I will be the one who's constantly trying to prove himself to others. The same I've always been. 

No more. No more of feeling sorry for myself. No more trying to prove myself to others. I have to do this. For me. 

Wish me luck, guys.

26015,Telling my Story,I didn’t think the female attraction was true,"I’ve seen so many success stories of how people have fallen in love after living the no fap life. And I thought it was a coincidence. But I may be wrong. Now, I’m not madly in love or anything like that. I’m only 17, about to graduate in a couple months here and go off to college. 

I’m a couple weeks into NoFap. I’ve been grinding the goods, roughing the suspect, griming the goblin, whatever you want to call it, on the daily for about 4 years now. My friend and I talked to each other and now we’re accountability partners for this challenge. I’m grateful for him, and also this sub. Although my journey has been somewhat short so far, I have already noticed some things.

I genuinely am in better moods, for the most part. But also, females. About a week and a half after I started, one of my female friends basically asked me to hang out with her, just the two of us. So we did. We went to a local coffee shop and played board games for 3 hours. I very much enjoyed it. I’ve never really had an authentic experience with a female before, so this was very nice. She is a very nice girl. Her friend wants me to ask her to this upcoming dance. I don’t know, we’ll see. 

Also, there’s another girl who randomly started talking to me. We both know of each other, and I’ve always thought she’s kinda attractive. I actually was the one who initially greeted her in the hallway at school. But to my surprise, later that day, she started snapchatting me. And now we talk a lot. I really enjoy having conversations with her. We’ve just talk about life, school, life after high school, etc. 


Now, I’m not saying I’m looking to date either one of these women. After all, I’m most likely moving a couple hours away next year for college. I guess what I’m just noticing in general is I’m able to have better, healthier, and more authentic conversations and relationships.

26043,Question to NoFap,What do you guys do for coping mechanisms?,"TL;DR what do you guys use for coping mechanisms when/if you get upset? People dealing with depression, what have you tried? 

On mobile btw. 
I’ve been trying nofap for 3 years now and my two highest streaks were at about 40 days. I’ve made a lot of progress from fapping almost everyday during my undergrad almost to an ED like state. 
I LOVE when my streak gets past about 20 days or so. I definitely feel better and more confident but one issue I deal with often is my depression. I’m getting help for it medicationwise but when it gets too much I need something to make me feel better. 
You can say I use porn and fapping as a coping mechanism. I’ve been doing it since I was young and frequently so it’s a habit that’s been ingrained pretty well whenever I get upset. 
This leads me to my question: what do you guys use for effective coping mechanisms when/if you get upset? People dealing with depression, what have you tried?

I also overeat when I’m stressed and gained some weight over the new school year. I’m in medical school now so it’s even more stressful than my undergrad. I haven’t been fapping as much as I was in undergrad but I still don’t have a good strategy. 

Thanks for all your help

26065,Question to NoFap,Looking for Real Answers,"Look, I was only interested in doing this because of my sex drive. I have no sex partners, never had a girlfriend, but when I feel like having sex, that’s what I want. Porn has been the only way I could even explore my sexuality.

Before you give me the list of reasons I should do NoFap, I’ve already been meditating. I’ve been going to the gym. I just finished a cleanse and am going to cut for a bit before doing a mini bulk. I’m productive during the day. I’m told I’m “handsome” by both sexes but guys generally compliment me more on my physique (just bro compliments nothing gay).

All I want is to have sex with girls I’m attracted to, that’s literally the one thing in my life that slows me down. When I think about how I haven’t been able to do that it just pisses me off. And before you ask, no I’m not a “nice guy” doing stupid shit.

I tried doing NoFap for a couple weeks but the only thing that even gets me to calm down is holding my breath until I’m on the verge of passing out. Even then, I’m not always in a situation where I can risk passing out so I can’t always rely on that.

Don’t worry, there was no blood this time thank god😂

I woke up and realized I wasn’t super fucking horny and found out that I had a wet dream, but I don’t feel guilty about it. 

My question is, do you guys ever feel guilty after a wet dream? Or do you feel normal afterward? I almost feel good, relaxed even

26112,Advice to NoFap,Why '90 days' won't cure your addiction,"&amp;nbsp;
we've all been there

&amp;nbsp;
after a horrible relapse

&amp;nbsp;
we bury our head;

&amp;nbsp;
we hastily delete the multitude of tabs

&amp;nbsp;
as we sit shamefully in our own sorrow

&amp;nbsp;
""Never again""

&amp;nbsp;
we say

&amp;nbsp;
""Today I start a new life""

&amp;nbsp;
we say

&amp;nbsp;
as we pound our fist in anger and regret

&amp;nbsp;
This addiction has such a stranglehold grip on our lives

&amp;nbsp;
So we strive to hit 90 days

&amp;nbsp;
""That's it!""

&amp;nbsp;
we say

&amp;nbsp;
From this day forth, ""I'm never going to masturbate""

&amp;nbsp;
""I'm going to be a changed man""

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
And this mindset works for a time.

&amp;nbsp;
You remember that pain of that relapse 

&amp;nbsp;
of that sorrow

&amp;nbsp;
of that agony

&amp;nbsp;
of living a life

&amp;nbsp;
a behavior

&amp;nbsp;
that is not in line with your ideals

&amp;nbsp;
This could last for a few days, a week. 

&amp;nbsp;
Maybe more.

&amp;nbsp;
But then we slip into our old habits.

&amp;nbsp;
Maybe we sit back in that place where we relapsed, and we get triggered.

&amp;nbsp;
Maybe something else triggers us,

&amp;nbsp;
and then we relapse again.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
And then we shamefully throw our hands up in defeat and say,

&amp;nbsp;
""I'll never cure this addiction""

&amp;nbsp;
""I'll never hit 90 days""

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
And it's true.

&amp;nbsp;
With this behavior

&amp;nbsp;
with this mindset

&amp;nbsp;
with this attitude of 'just 90 days'

&amp;nbsp;
you will never cure this addiction. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
90 days is irrelevant.

&amp;nbsp;
Any amount of days are irrelevant.

&amp;nbsp;
1 day of nofap is just as powerful as the next, and the next, and the next.

&amp;nbsp;
If you want to quit this addiction,

&amp;nbsp;
quit thinking in this capped mindset of 'x days'

&amp;nbsp;
you must let NO DOUBT seep into your mind.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
if you still have doubts to why you are doing Nofap, you must strengthen your resolve. 

&amp;nbsp;
You must define for yourself, clearly, why you are doing what you are doing, 

&amp;nbsp;
because if not, you will eventually relapse.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
You won't 'just beat' the addiction

&amp;nbsp;
It is a constant battle 

&amp;nbsp;
of attention

&amp;nbsp;
of conviction 

&amp;nbsp;
of resolve

&amp;nbsp;
That lasts much longer than 90 days.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
I'm at 90+ days right now

&amp;nbsp;
and I hardly think of looking at porn anymore

&amp;nbsp;
however,

&amp;nbsp;
the images that have been burned in my mind for years are still there (slowly leaving, but still there)

&amp;nbsp;
The muscle memory of my hand on my d*ck is still there

&amp;nbsp;
There are remnants of the addiction still there

&amp;nbsp;
that may never go away

&amp;nbsp;
But that's ok

&amp;nbsp;
because my mindset has changed

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
Any second you could relapse

&amp;nbsp;
in any addiction 

&amp;nbsp;
It's not about a 'streak' 

&amp;nbsp;
or by doing X number of days so I can relapse or finally masturbate again.

&amp;nbsp;
You must think for yourself

&amp;nbsp;
strategize for yourself

&amp;nbsp;
patterns, behaviours, situations, friends,

&amp;nbsp;
that will put you in the best environment for success;

&amp;nbsp;
reasons why you are doing Nofap

&amp;nbsp;
and those reasons must be strong enough to carry you through 90+ days, 

&amp;nbsp;
through a lifetime.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
Because we won't change, 

&amp;nbsp;
if we don't change our mindset

&amp;nbsp;
If part of you still wants to fap

&amp;nbsp;
if part of you still justifies it,

&amp;nbsp;
it will take hold of you in a weak moment

&amp;nbsp;
figure out what rationale that side uses

&amp;nbsp;
figure out what reasons you employ,

&amp;nbsp;
why you still want to fap

&amp;nbsp;
could it be you are lonely?

&amp;nbsp;
could it be you want to feel good about your body?

&amp;nbsp;
crush those arguments with a more powerful one

&amp;nbsp;
and hold onto your new found mindset

&amp;nbsp;
because in your weakest moments, 

&amp;nbsp;
You'll have to remember why you are doing Nofap.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
In these 90 days, 

&amp;nbsp;
I have looked at porn

&amp;nbsp;
I have stroked my d*ck

&amp;nbsp;
I have almost relapsed.

&amp;nbsp;
But I didn't,

&amp;nbsp;
because I caught myself.

&amp;nbsp;
I didn't 

&amp;nbsp;
because I combatted the demons which try to control me

&amp;nbsp;
I faced them, 

&amp;nbsp;
and I threw them down

&amp;nbsp;
I employed practical strategies that would keep me from getting to a PONR , 

&amp;nbsp;
but all backed up with a solid reasoning.

&amp;nbsp;
And above all, I rooted myself in solid principles, 

&amp;nbsp;
because I knew, deep down inside, I really didn't want to fap

&amp;nbsp;
if you think, deep down inside, that fapping is OK, 

&amp;nbsp;
you need to reevaluate, 

&amp;nbsp;
because you won't be able to beat the addiction if you don't. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
My mindset breakdown is as follows:

&amp;nbsp;
Broader principle - ""I don't fap, because I know the perfect version of myself does not fap. 

&amp;nbsp;
I know this behavior is not conducive to living the life I want to live, to being the ultimate version of myself.""

&amp;nbsp;
-It is solitary , it is lonely, it is a fantasy, it objectifies women,

&amp;nbsp;
It wastes my precious seed -it wastes my vitality,

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
practical mindsets:

&amp;nbsp;
do not touch my d*ck : ""I don't want to associate feeling horny with me touching my dick, ""I want to repair this mind muscle connection""

&amp;nbsp;
this helps me from relapsing when I feel horny.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
Also, the mindset of looking at porn, ""just a peek"" will not help . 
If you find yourself justifying this behavior, backtrack and figure out why. Perhaps you are scared to fully give up fapping?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
bottom line,

&amp;nbsp;
these behaviors

&amp;nbsp;
this addiction

&amp;nbsp;
doesn't just 'go away'

&amp;nbsp;
you can't just fap today 

&amp;nbsp;
and the next day go for a  90 day streak,
if nothing else changes

&amp;nbsp;
You have to take a step back and

&amp;nbsp;
PLAN

&amp;nbsp;
and THINK

&amp;nbsp;
and dive deep inside

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
Ask yourself

&amp;nbsp;
why am I fapping?

&amp;nbsp;
what can I change that will help me put me in an environment for success?

&amp;nbsp;
Am I justifying these addictions? why?

&amp;nbsp;
sometimes we can do it alone

&amp;nbsp;
sometimes we can't

&amp;nbsp;
it's not immature to know when to ask for help

&amp;nbsp;
it's not weakness

&amp;nbsp;
in fact, those who are strongest

&amp;nbsp;
are those who are comfortable

&amp;nbsp;
and are of sound enough mind , body, and spirit

&amp;nbsp;
to admit weakness

&amp;nbsp;
that we are not perfect

&amp;nbsp;
that we need to grow

&amp;nbsp;
It is most humble

&amp;nbsp;
And it is what life is about.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
this won't change

&amp;nbsp;
if you don't change your self

&amp;nbsp;
if you don't change your approach

&amp;nbsp;
if you don't change your strategy

&amp;nbsp;
don't get complacent

&amp;nbsp;
keep fighting

&amp;nbsp;
keep growing

&amp;nbsp;
even after 90 days you will be stronger

&amp;nbsp;
but you will still have to fight

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
and you will get there

&amp;nbsp;
if you try,

&amp;nbsp;
if you succeed one day at a time,

&amp;nbsp;
you will become

&amp;nbsp;
the ultimate version of yourself

&amp;nbsp;
you will become

&amp;nbsp;
the person of your dreams

&amp;nbsp;

26150,Telling my Story,"Quitting was easy, but started off flatlined; any similar experiences? My story as a 32 year old.","Hi Team,

&amp;#x200B;

Thought I would share my story below, and see if anyone else has had a similar experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 32 year old male, who started w/high-speed porn probably around 13. I viewed on average probably 3-5x a week since then; maybe more when I was younger. I'm currently engaged, and have been with fiancee for a few years, living together for the past couple.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past several years, I've experienced many of the symptoms others on here have; major brain fog, lack of motivation at work, very low sex-drive, massively decreased desire to be social. All of these have been increasingly concerning to me, and I've been wondering what was wrong with me, since I'm nothing like the person I was before.

&amp;#x200B;

I was always a straight-A student, considered by others to be the smartest kid in class. I've always felt sharp and eloquent, until the last few years, where I've had trouble speaking well, using my vocabulary, and just remembering things in general. I no longer feel like one of the smarter people in the room, and have had the feeling that the people around me simply have a higher IQ than I do. My boss asks me questions I can't answer and I feel like an idiot. I described it as brain fog before I even discovered nofap or the potential connection to porn.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a professional, and when I first started at my firm,  I was the most motivated person in my year. I loved my job and wanted to make partner. This desire completely vanished several years ago, and I convinced myself I was content with a mediocre career, so long as I could make a ""decent"" living, despite having worked so hard before to put myself in a position to make millions a year.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancee is objectively incredibly sexy. When we first started dating, my libido was understandably higher. But I would say that after the first year or so, it dramatically decreased. She's asked me on multiple occasions ""why don't we have sex anymore"". We went from doing it several times a week to once every couple of weeks or months. Having sex with her became a chore; it was so much easier to just go to my computer and get my release there. I have wondered if this is normal; if it's something that just happens as men get older, you've been in a relationship for longer, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I also used to be incredibly social. I had tons of friends and always loved going out and partying. Although I have moved to a different city a few years ago, lately, I just prefer to hole up in my apartment all weekend, rather than go meet friends for drinks or do any activities. I've wondered why this is; am I just getting older? Do I not like the people in my new city? Is there nothing fun to do here? I've come up with lots of excuses, I'm not sure any of which are valid.

&amp;#x200B;

I say none of the above in a bragging way, but to illustrate how terrible I have felt on the inside for so long, despite objectively having it pretty good to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially for the past few years, I have felt dumber, slower, older, and, I guess, depressed and flatlined.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now:**

&amp;#x200B;

By total chance, I stumbled upon Your Brain on Porn. I read it in two days after I got it, and quit porn immediately. It's now been 15 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Quitting porn was easy for me once I started to connect the dots. I now have an aversion to it, and never want to look at that shit again given how much I think it may have harmed me.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read here about the cravings people have after they quit, how hard it is for the first few weeks, and how the inevitable flatline eventually comes.

&amp;#x200B;

However, for me, I've had no cravings or urges since I stopped over two weeks ago. What people describe as a flatline, I seem to have been experiencing even before I quit.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question for this group is, has anyone else had a similar experience? I.e., flatlined before they even quit, and just remained in a flatlined state thereafter?**

&amp;#x200B;

Wondering if anyone's in the same boat or gone through this, if they felt better after some time passed, etc.",20,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aim5sa/quitting_was_easy_but_started_off_flatlined_any/

26221,Emergency - Help!,8day streak.. not my longest though.. can anyone help?,"I’m on day 7 currently.. and I haven’t really noticed anything apart from waking up with a 20% erections (morning wood) this morning.

Now I met this girl at the New Years party I had &amp; we’ve kicked it off.. she had a boyfriend when I first met her but has since broken up with him as she feels a lot happier with me. When I’ve been with her we’ve been cuddling, holding hands etc and I feel little erections down there when this happens like 30%. Better than nothing I know, but when I’m by myself I don’t get any erections at all since I started NoFap this year.

I’ve probably been addicted to porn since I was 16 and now I’m 22, I’ve slept with about 40 girls but noticed my last two experiences in 2018 my erections we’re getting weaker.. this was while I was still watching porn. 

I think I have PIED hence why I wanted to start NoFap.

The girl I’m currently seeing I’ve said to her I don’t want to rush into anything as I want to see out the 30day hard mode.

Why am I having little to no movement down there right now?

Is cuddling &amp; kissing &amp; having sexual contact with a girl a good thing? 
As I’m rewiring my brain to an actually human and not pixels?

And after the 30 days if we have sex, will my PIED come back cause I don’t want it to feel dead after?

When will my morning wood come back?

And when will I get a full ballsack because it always feels completely empty?

P.S longest streak is 21 days and I noticed k was almost fully recovering before slipping down into my habit again. Currently no libido &amp; balls feel permanently empty.

But today I experienced that at the University. I was just sitting there during a computer session and I felt the eyes on me.

One girl was staring at me and when I looked in her direction, she run away from the stare. Another one was looking at me many times and she doesn't run away from the stare.
The fird just came at my place because she was behind me and asked for a question and she initiate the presentation, ask me my name and give me her name without me  asking. After we laughed together because the lesson wasn't interesting.
At the break I discussed a little bit with another but we were in a group so... 

But I mean I didn't know them at all. There are girls from another speciality but we have only few courses together. We have nether talked together. They have never looked at me before. May be I'm emitting something intense. Lol😂

Of course it is not a generality. I'm just sharing my experience. It's just the first time I experienced that. We will see if there are some improvements.

26505,Journal Check-In,End of day 8,"Today a relapse was very, very close. First time home alone during current streak. NoFap emergency tool gave a reddit post that took the urge away on the spot. Other than the time being home I've been almost urge free today. Then again, I've had stuff to do all day.

I've been thinking about the ""core"" of the whole NoFap thing, and my motivations for it. I'm still somewhat unexperienced on the whole NoFap community and so (even though I've been struggling with PMO stuff for years), but I can tell it's not an easy road, nor ""just"" about avoiding PMO. It's about a whole different lifestyle that you develop on your journey. ""Succesful"" NoFap requires you to develop self-control/discipline, which most of us haven't had a lot before starting this journey. All the lifestyle changes that occur thanks to developing discipline make you more confident, healthier etc. Part of it is of course ""rebooting"" from the negative effects of pornography and masturbation, but most of it is about a lifestyle change, where you start living more in the real world so to say. You start to see that other people are not there just for your pleasure, not even your spouse (when you get married). As a consequence you start to grow more as a person (especially mentally).

For me this change started to really kick off when Jesus freed me from video game addiction and when I started to process some traumatic events from my childhood and the emotions related to them. I also had a 30+ day streak of P-mode before relapsing and then finding this community shortly after (8 days ago). I've probably experienced the same struggles all of you or most of you have, but I faced most of it alone. And I'm really thankful to finding this community; especially the panic button has saved me from reset or relapse a few times already.

At least some of you may think this community will do the work for you, but in the end it's your own struggle from start to finish, whether you like it or not. When you start to understand that you're responsible for your own actions you'll probably (and hopefully) get more hold of the concept and start to accept that life isn't going to be dancing on the rose petals; it's dancing on whole roses with their spikes and all. Hopefully at that point you'll start developing discipline (maybe even find Jesus) and acting responsibly instead of just crying your ass off about how tough life is (&lt;---- my state less than a month ago when thinking about my responsibilities). Don't make it more difficult to yourself than it really is. What I mean is that most of your responsibilities aren't really difficult, they just require you to spend time on them and to form routine. You will do surprisingly well, when you start to actually do stuff.

26520,Journal Check-In,Day 24 - Social anxiety is healing,"Social anxiety has been a major issue for me for years. When I was simply walking by myself and meeting people going in the opposite direction, I got nervous. PMO somehow made me so ego-centric that my brain would tell me that every person I met was staring at me as they passed me by and it would get to me so much that I even got shaky legs and had a hard time walking straight. As you can imagine I kept my eyes down on the ground without exception. 

&amp;#x200B;

24 days in on NoFap I have already started noticing increased energy levels, more testosterone flowing in my body and it sure has helped when I walk out in public. Today I was walking on my University campus and there were lots of people out and about. I just spontaneously started looking at every person's face as I passed them by. I came to realize that the majority of people didn't even look at me at all. A few girls maybe caught eye contact but then looked away and a girl here and there would even smile back. As I was still walking, I realized that I received energy (dopamine?) from these small but meaningful interactions. If this much has changed for me in the matter of a few weeks, I can't even imagine what reaching 90 days or 1 year will be like!

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: 

&amp;#x200B;

Social anxiety is getting cured, most people don't stare at you in public. The few people who do look will most likely look away as soon as your eyes meet or give a smile, so nothing negative!

I am going to mention a situation that might trigger someone but I feel like there is no way you will get aroused in the context I am going to mention it in, on the opposite I think it will motivate you.

""I don't have an addiction, I am not like those sick fucks on the internet, what I do is completely healthy, I don't even do it that often"" 

Heared this before? sounds like you? 

I was at the pub, talking with my friends november is around the corner, somehow the conversation shift to no-fap november, so one guy start arguing how porn is bad for you and so on, you are on this sub so you know what he was talking about, I agree with him I have read somewhere the same things, how it makes you detached and unable to connect with other people and in particular with girls, he is right but *I am not one of them*

He says, ""you might not realize it"",

""I am sure I would realize, look, november is in a few days, I will do all no-fap november without breaking a sweat""

One week goes by, barely manage to resist, I feel like I am about to do it at every moment, the slightest scratch turns me on, but I resist. 

On day 7 I think ""why am I doing this, *I am not one of them* I don't have a problem, why shoulddn't I do something I enjoy for a stupid bet"" I masturbate think nothing of it, it's ok, a couple of hours go by, it's a slow day, happens again, still have tabs open, better keep them for later and so on...

The next day same story, and so on for a couple of weeks. 

First day of last week of november, I masturbate, that doesn't feel good ""I suppose I am kind of tired"",

The same happens the next day ""I suppose I wasn't that hony"",

Again next day ""I didn't give myself enough time for sure""

(don't read this very next spoiler if easily aroused)

&gt;!A girl-friend of mine talks to me about the fact she wants to try anal play on his bf but he doesn't want to try, later that day I decide to try just to be prepared if a girl ever ask me to try, I manage to get an orgasm!&lt;

The next day I masturbate again, no orgasm, i try what I talk about in the spoiler but no luck, this goes on till the end of november 

I finally realise I have a problem, I knew I am a person prone to addiction and once I start something doing I have no self control and that's why I stay away from things that cause addiction but I did not see this one coming.

On that day I stopped masturbating and watching porn I didn't set a goal, I just knew I needed to stop, I felt sick, the inability to orgasm and to mantain a full erection was enogh to keep me from masturbating.

So far you might say this is a pretty average story, nothing major, you have read this before for sure, just wait and I will tell you what the consequence of this addictions are.

It's now december, around christmas, I don't feel any of the good effects people claim to notice after 2-3 weeks but that's ok for me, I still feel pretty bad about what happened and that alone keeps me from even thinking of masturbation, also the fact I am not getting morning woods and random erections during the day helps a lot but makes me feel sick at the same time.

It's christmas time and I go out more often than usual since I have some time on my hands, in this group of friends there is this girl, she has always been nice to me but never tought much of it, we are at a christmas party and while I highly discourage the use of alcohol that evening it gave a little push, we talked for a while then she kissed me, we started dating, she is amazing, cute and genuinely funny, I probably never had such a great time with a girl.

We continue dating and she makes clear she wants something more than just date and kisses

(the next part might get you aroused but I am sure when you read till the end you will feel everything but aroused)

So I take her to my place, we talk, watch an old episode of a series we both like &gt;!she makes clear that tv time is over, we start making out, she undress me, I am about to do the same but she blushed a little and ask me if I can dim the lights, I do so and go on, she is so cute, she plays with me, looks like I am ready, I put on a condom, I am about to make love to her but I can't, my penis simply won't stay hard. !&lt;

There are a lot of sad things in life that will make you sad, but thrust me, there aren't many things that will make you feel worst than having a girl, and not any girl one you actually care about, wipe her tears front of you telling you ""maybe you don't like me, maybe that's why you ignored me in the last months, this was a mistake you don't care about me"". 

Where you go from there? what do you tell her? I want you to really think of it. You will want to die, you are there stripped of your confidence, you have been working a lot, you have been lifting weights you look kind of good now, you have a clean shave, you showered and smell good, none of that matters right now you are just there thinking about the fact you may never be able to be with a girl for the rest of your life, you will be about to cry struggling to keep your composure in front of this girl and at the same time you will be dealing not only with your own pain but with hers, right now she is vulnerable exactly like you and she will be feeling insecure about herself and she will feel bad for trusting you.

You can do nothing, you lay there in bed, talk to here, you say how you are a little tired, how you are a little nervous, you know it's a lie and you know you are not that good of a lier to make that belivable. None of you is talking, the great atmosphere there is between you two is now dead. You bring her home in complete silence, she kisses you on the check and tells you not to worry too much about it but she still has red eyes from before.

Still not good enough of a motivation for you to stop masturbating? don't worry I got more 

It's now the next day, you didn't sleep all night, you know what the problem is, but it's easier to blame something else and not you, so you go to the doctor, tell him about you problems, not the cause because you are grown enough to talk about the problem you had but not mature enough to tell him what caused them. He writes you off saying you where probably just nervous and gives you pills just in case (I am not going to name the pill because I don't want anyone going to their doctor asking for pills they read about on the internet, let's just say the effects are similar to the more famous blue pill)

You see her again, you have the same problem yet again, but this time you have a plan B, you tell her she agrees, she ask if it's dangerous you tell it isn't not, having care not to mention the not so rare temporary blindess and deafness it might cause and all those others less common and ""less scary"" side effects like stroke and istant heart faliure. 

Right now you are thinking, there is nothing that can go wrong now, right? yes you are right everyting works, your body is doing what it's supposed to do, but now you might realize it's not the body in itself the problem, but the head, you are doing what you are supposed to do, but you are not involved, you are not getting any pleasure, you are not enjoying yourself you are there being as close as two human beings can possibly be and you are feeling nothing completely detached, you kiss her trying to hide the fact you might as well be washing your car and you would probably get more enjoyiment out of the latter at some point you are done, no excitement, no satisfaction it just happens you barely notice.

You feel bad, empty, she kisses you and you are there wondering if you will get enjoyment out of that ever again.

The next day now only you feel like sh\*t emotionally you feel like your head was kicked by a bunch of guys (common side effect of the pill)

You try again next day and nothing changes you manage to do it without the use of pills but it still feels ampty and pointless.

You might think this only affects your sex life, it doesn't, you will realize that while you have a lot of fun with her and she is basically the girl you have been dreaming of, you feel nothing 

You try your best, but there is nothing you can do, you are deatached you still go out on dates but realize you don't really care 

I think this might give you an idea of how harmful this habbit can become, if any of you is wondering me and this girl stopped seeing each other, that just didn't feel right I felt nothing and I didn't want to hurt her being distant.   


Just stop, you d\*ck is the least of your problem, the real danger is becoming deatached to emotions like I did, save yourself and stop now.

If you have any questions I will be happy to help you in any way I can, I might not get back to you immediatly since it's getting pretty late writing this but I swear I will get back at you as soon as I see your comment

26801,New to NoFap,"Just talked to my wife, taking the plunge.","So I've decided to give nofap a shot. For a variety of reasons - religious, mental, and personal - but I was always worried about what my wife would think. 

I've been watching porn and masturbating basically as long as I can remember. At least since I was in high school, and I'm late twenties now. I don't think I've ever gone more than a couple days without it unless outside of specific circumstances (traveling with my family, staying with friends, etc), and even then it didn't always stop me. Being Catholic, I've always had guilt over it, but then again what don't Catholics feel guilty over?

But lately it's really been weighing on me. I can't open my phone without switching to my Reddit account that's subscribed to all the porn subs. I can't get on the PC when I'm home alone without going Incognito. Heck in real life, I'm rarely able to look at an attractive woman without imagining... things. Vividly. 

I've always found ways to tell myself it's ok. Self-pleasure is healthy - lots of studies about it. It's a good way to know yourself, relieve stress, and get your blood pumping! All these articles can't be wrong! And besides, if it was wrong, why does it feel good? Nothing wrong with feeling good.

But honestly, I never feel good after. I just feel like I'm not in control and that I can't even think without flashing 18+ imagery and lewd thoughts across my brain. I feel like it's tainted my image of women, including my wife.

Which brings me to the title. I talked about it with my wife, told her what I've been going through and that I'm trying to stop. We're trying to get pregnant, so during ovulation we're obviously going to be intimate, but I was open about my addiction and my desire to overcome it. 

My wife, the lovely, amazing woman she is, was fully supportive, if a bit confused. She just thought that this sort of thing, even as much as I was doing it, was normal and all guys were like that. And maybe today it is, for whatever that says about our society, but I told her I felt helpless and that I needed to change, and she was there for me, which was a huge weight off my chest.

So, here I go. Normal mode, I guess, but I think I need to go through this so I can at least feel better about my own headspace. Sorry about the ramble, I guess I just needed to get it out there. ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aiub02/just_talked_to_my_wife_taking_the_plunge/

If your girlfriend is aware of your problem or anyone you’re willing to let in about your porn addiction you can restrict things on your phone

If you have an iphone you can go into general then settings and then go into restrictions, have your girl or friend make a password that only they know and are not to share with you and is not easy for you to guess
There youre able to go to into your web restrictions and click to restrict all adult websites
You can also have them put “never allow” and a site u constantly go on to make sure its blocked with no chance of getting through



It has helped my boyfriend avoid going on pornographic sites

He also has no social media now and that has also helped a big deal

I find that twitter is a big problem with porn addicts as its so easy to access porn, snapchat premium, and any other triggers 

Instagram is more okay but if youre very vulnerable i suggest staying off it!

Things will get difficult, you'll stumble upon gloomy days, and sometimes you might not even feel good mentally or physically to continue.

Things are going good so far. I haven't seen or felt any of the *superpowers* r/nofap members claim to have but then again, it's been only 6 days. I have complemented journey with some meditation and pranayama. It was only 5 mins of meditation and 10 mins of pranayama but that's a start. 

I have managed to stay away from PMO so far and I am psyched about finishing it. 

I have thought about doing mini celebrations along the way: one week without PMO, one month, half away, 75% done and of course, the final victory. **Any suggestions for how I should reward myself?** 

I cannot take credit for this strategy. The suggestion came from [WilleWiki19](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilleWiki19) (again, thanks for following me :P) when he commented on my second day report.

I have this app called [Countdown](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/countdown-app-free-big-day-event-timer-reminder/id647750636?mt=8) on my phone and I am keeping track of the days. Here are my milestones.

1. 1 week: 24 Jan 2019 - 113 days from victory. (happening tomorrow)
2. 1 month/ 30 days: 17 Feb 2019: 90 days from victory
3. Halfway: 19 Mar 2019: 60 days from victory
4. 75%: 18 Apr 2019: 30 days from victory
5. Victory: 18 May 2019. End of NoFap.

The second milestone falls perfectly with a religious ceremony I am taking part in, for which I will have to be without internet for seven to eight (which means no regular posting :/...) but I will give a detailed account of what happened.

27035,Confession,hardest challenge of my f****** life,"hey guys, 17/m here. this is going to be the start of my indefinite streak and (hopefully) the end of my addiction.

This change of my life has been the absolute hardest thing to accomplish, mainly because I accidentally introduced myself to masturbation at an EXTREMELY young age (say like 8 or 9 y/o). As far as I recall, I've PMOed on average around once per day since then, which led to me practically wasting my childhood. That's more than 3,300 times beginning before I even hit puberty. I believe I'm a relatively extreme case. I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD around 2 years ago, and blamed it all on the schoolwork and stress. I didn't realize the impact of my horrible habit until recently, since I thought NoFap was some sort of silly test of endurance instead of a therapeutic method. My middle and high school career went down the drain socially, and I feel horrible that I wasted it since I'm going to college soon. Every morning after PMOing I would feel so incredibly drained for a then unknown reason that I sometimes would start crying. My hair was so thin by the time I was only 13 that you could see my scalp, leading to more teasing that dug me into a deeper pit. I didn't have a base ounce of motivation for the past decade of my life, so every day was a complete test of willpower to go out and succeed. However, when I went on a 15 day streak in the past month I actually found normal life somewhat ... exciting (i guess?) and I enjoyed having conversations with people and they seemed to enjoy me. Whenever school stressed me out, I guess I just used PMOing to temporarily escape reality, and it caused some serious scarring and lack of motivation. My friends don't know this about me, but I'm so glad that they stuck around and dealt with me being this way. If I'm capable of ending this horrible nightmare, than you are as well. I'll try to post journal checks with my situation. I am going to stop, not only for me, but for my wonderful friends and family. peace.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aivyal/hardest_challenge_of_my_f_life/

27046,Relapse Report,What's the point,"20 days ago, I decided to do No Fap with a friend of mine as an accountability partner. Yesterday, I relapsed and now I just don't feel motivated to try again. 20 days was almost as long as when I was going in No Nut November. But now, I feel like it's just a sweet release and I want to go find all the good stuff I've been missing out on. Why continue trying? I know I'm a slave to it, but honestly, I'm not strong enough. I don't see myself being able to do this. ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aiw0uu/whats_the_point/
27053,Advice to NoFap,10 days in ALREADY experiencing massive benefits.,"The best advice from this subreddit that I ever read was essentially ""don't use nofap to jack up your testosterone so you can attract women."" My longest streak prior to this point was around 60 days ( 40ish if you consider hard mode, but I started seeing a girl at this point so I was ejaculating regularly even if I wasn't watching porn). 

The problem with porn addiction isn't that it makes you filled with shame and awkward around women, the problem with porn addiction is that it significantly decreases your baseline mood, motivation and ability to concentrate.

Wanting to be more successful with women is a completely valid reason to start nofap, but as you work towards your first 90 days the increased confidence and easiness of interaction with women should be seen as an ancillary benefit. If you use nofap purely to jack up your sex drive, then when it peaks about a week in you're going to say to yourself ""Okay, it's probably fine now if I let off a little steam."" We all know what relapsing feels like, and we all know that when that timer goes back to zero the mentality of ""well now I have nothing to lose"" and the PMO binge that comes with it is hard to avoid.

PMO addiction isn't a bad habit, like cracking your knuckles or chewing your nails, it's a brain disease. It worms its way through every facet of your consciousness and it gradually erodes everything good in your life. 

Even 10 days in, I'm already finding it possible to appreciate the moments that used to fill me with immeasurable boredom. I'm just happier all around, and yes women do seem more attracted to me and that's a huge part of the reason I'm doing this but it can't be my only reason or I WILL relapse and it shouldn't be yours either or you probably will too.

Your goal should not be to build up your libido until you get laid, your goal should be to let yourself be deprived of sexual release until your brain relearns how to feel good without sexual stimulation.

I know everything I've said here has been said before and better by some member of this reddit, but I think every testimony contributes to the credibility of this community, and so I'm going to keep posting and sharing my experience and I encourage everyone else taking part in this very worthwhile endeavor to do the same.

27086,Relapse Report,End of Day 0 Log - Time to Really Think about Masturbation,"So yesterday I didn't have any urges at all until I was actually in bed. Then I was bored, and a little anxious, and wanted that good feeling from fantasizing to replace it. I resisted fantasizing successfully. Then, later in the night (I was having trouble getting to sleep) I had to get up to do something, and when I went back to bed... I masturbated. Why? I was bored and a little anxious, and it felt good. Kind of. But my brain didn't seem to have much of an issue with it.  I need to address that.

&amp;#x200B;

Masturbation was not a problem for me in the past. Fantasizing and porn have long been problems, and I know very well why they're bad for me. I know that I can get addicted to masturbation, and that I can end up doing it a whole lot more than could possibly be healthy if I rely on it. This hasn't ever happened, but I know it could. So, I don't masturbate when I'm thinking clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

Why not do it in bed when I'm falling asleep? Orgasm isn't bad in itself. The main reason I feel to not masturbate is because it's socially unacceptable, but a less conscious part of me doesn't seem to like that reason. What are some good reasons?

* It stains the sheets if I'm not careful, and is probably bad for my clothes. That's kind of gross. And ugly. I rather like having clean sheets, both visually and physically.
* It's not really solving the problem. This is where the addiction can come from. If I was bored from not doing anything that day, I should live with that as a just lesson that my body is teaching me: ""Being lazy is a bad idea. It is not good for you."" It's better to listen than to numb the signal. Similarly, if I'm anxious, that anxiety should be addressed directly, not numbed out.
* If I accept that masturbation is an okay solution to those problems, I will come to depend on it without it ever really satisfying. Once my brain figures out that it doesn't really satisfy, it will demand more to compensate. Addiction ensues. It's only seemed okay so far because I haven't been addressing it consciously. Whenever I do, I choose not to do it, even when I was in the middle of watching porn.

It's time to stop killing the signals. I did it recently and it was so unpleasant that I only kept it up for about a week, and a few days later I relapsed. But in that time I also started to make progress out of the real problems. I will have to endure some pain in order to have the motivation to fix things. The pain *is* the motivation. Without it there will be little progress. Not none, but not much. It will be slower.

&amp;#x200B;

27093,Victory,One Week Free! Kind of...,"Today  was the hardest day I've had yet. I'm not going to lie, I did peek at some nudes but only for a minute. It was so difficult to overcome this urge as I was home alone and have been having extremely sexual dreams lately. 

One of the ways I overcome these urges is by taking a step back and remembering why I am doing this challenge in the first place and reminding myself that what I am looking at is not real or natural.

Obviously, this is easier said than done but this community is the reason I am remaining strong. This is a huge accomplishment for me.

What I have noticed: 

\-My skin is beginning to clear up after trying every skin care routine with no avail.

\-I have more energy, drive and a clearer mind, allowing me to focus better.

It's a first time over the video any girl presented herself to me like the way she did. So it was her leap of faith which she took inspired me to fap later(adding ofcourse the way she was looking).
Look guys!! I have not been watching porn for more than 3 months now. I haven't masturbated from 9 days. But on the 9th night this happened. 
I wanted to resist my urge last night but I immediately made up this thought that this is could be counted as an inspiration as our relationship is reaching next out to trust each other now. 
So what should I count it as 
INSPIRATIONAL FAP?
atleast this was not out of desperation right?

27118,New to NoFap,I need to vent.,"I started this journey on 15th January, 2019. Today is my 8th day and my urges are starting to get out of hand. I came THIS close to typing ""pornhub"" into my browser's search bar four fucking times today. Also, I can't focus on my studies. All my brain can think of right now is watching porn and fapping. God, I feel so miserable... I want to cry but the tears just won't come out. I was afraid that I would relapse and come back to square one so I decided to visit NoFap, install reddit on my phone and subscribe to this subreddit. Honestly, I just wanted to vent. If this is against the rules, so be it. Go ahead and delete my post. I don't care because I feel a lot better now. So anyway, thanks for hearing me out. 
Edit: I forced myself to sit down and not move for an entire hour. That is how I meditate. I can guarantee that the urges have subsided, at least for the time being. I don't want to fap or look at porn anymore, at least for now. Also, thanks to everyone who commented. All these encouraging replies have boosted my morale and I feel better now.

27154,Relapse Report,Relapsed at day 8. Don't feel regret.,"Hello everyone.  I relapsed 1 hour ago, after I was feeling extremely horny for sexting with a girl, went to take the magical cold shower but it didn't have effect on me this time. Ended up masturbating without porn and it was one of the greatest orgasms by fapping I have ever had.No regrets at all, I even feel better, more productive and clear minded. 

I know my goal was to achieve 1 month but it's ok, I surpassed my last record which was 1 week. Gonna start over from now, but this time actually aiming at 1 month.

The benefits of those 8 days were time saving and I guess the arousal made me talk to more girls, but I ended up flirting with anything that could move (namely, ugly girls). So, not many benefits to regret so far. (idk why men regret so much when they break they streak).

I really wanna see all those benefits or ""superpowers"" users talk about tho. So...

27187,Success Story,NOFAP PIED Success AMA,"Background

24 
Had good sex life 
Girlfriends and other beautiful women 
Every so often I would get a small bit of PIED but would blame it on being tired 
One day I PIED with one of the most beautiful women ever.. inside and out she was amazing.. gorgeous and sweet and funny. and I could see it hurt her she thought it was her fault which co couldnt be further from the truth. We've never gotten off the ground since.. hoping to rectify that cause she's Amazing 

I never really PMOd in relationships.. maybe if she was gone for extended periods.. 

When I was single and moved away from home PMO became routine 

Every night before bed, it helped me sleep so I thought..  but it really became routine.. 

It got to the stage where I would have multiple tabs, skipping to good bits, favourite videos, and eventually.. one night, I bussed a nut, and it was bleak.. I finished dissatisfied.. even porn didn't satisfy me now. That was the night before my PIED episode that changed my life. (I even PIED with a 10/10 hooker.. that really made me look at myself) 

So I went cold turkey.

Nofap, cold showers, meditate, gym 6 days per week, cleaned my diet, cleaned my mind..

I'm only on day 7 and last night I successfully slept with a girl.. (sober and tired)

Nofap is working. 

I have a way to go yet.. and I don't even think I will sleep with girls as regularly as I did..  I was also a tinder addict.. sleeping with many girls a week like a video game, without any meaning

I can see nofap is giving me more energy in my daily life and I can see all the 'superpower' benefits people talk about 

But like that you can't just nofap

You have to improve your life in other areas too

Other things i am focusing on:
My career 
My finance
My handwriting 
My family 
My friends 

I am gunna keep going like this indefinitely I hope it makes me a better person .. I think it is anyway. 

You have all motivated me, I hope I can now do the same..

27211,Motivation,I feel a lot more resilient,"Im on day 45 of No Fap. I’ve noticed that in this short period of time there are things within me that are changing. Biologically for sure, but also emotionally as well. 

Before no fap, I would just get high and sulk around if I had a setback in life or accomplishing goals. E.g. I would fap, get high, play video games, watch TV shows, procrastinate on important things. All of this would lead to a downward spiral of emotions and I would just get more and more depressed. 

I knew I was tired of fucking my right hand and I just decided to stop one day. This is the longest I’ve gone without fapping ever since I learned to fap. I feel much more resilient when I face a setback. I’ll sulk for a bit but then I’ll just get this massive drive to take control of my life and be the driving force. E.g. I got rejected by this single mom I was pursuing. I started exercising more and more since then. Another example is that I fell down the stairs in the gym and hurt my back. Couldn’t walk for a few days. I was sad and annoyed for a bit cuz it was slowing down my exercise gains. But my drive kicked in and I did two yoga classes back to back and feel a lot better. It’s a drive I get to take action. MASSIVE Action! 

This drive is a superpower. For when you fap, you feel powerless.. you give in to everything. No Fap gives you superpowers!

27213,New to NoFap,[NSFW] I feel the need to share why I’m here.,"Ok so first off I would consider myself to be an introvert. I am shy, don’t talk often to strangers I met in public bc the presence of random humans disgust me, I believe strongly that I have social anxiety bc I always try to end interactions as fast as possible and put on a fake smile to hide my emotions. I never vent to people or even my immediate family, I like to be a grey man and keep everything about myself private so posting something on the internet like this is new to me.

I have been masturbaiting since I was around 13 years old. Now I’m a average looking male 20 year old ex high school athlete who is in college now. I lost my virginity about a year and a half ago also I have been single my whole life, much later compared to all of my friends because I just didn’t care for sex at the time (because I was masturbaiting around 4-5 times a week). This is where the problems started she was a random hook up from tinder, during intercourse she was having the time of her life and I was just pounding away and thinking in my head no way this is what sex feels like why doesn’t it feel as good as everyone says it does (note: I masturbated a hour before because I read it made you last longer and I was nervous of busting quick) so that possibly the reason. I got tired and told her to blow me and I got soft during it and never ejaculated. Fast forward November 2018 I lasted 9 days into no nut  November and then relapsed and started masturbating back to back pretty much daily bc it didn’t feel good enough the first time and I would have to spend 30-60 minutes looking for the right porn to watch bc It started taking a while for me to get hard. I didn’t think anything of it. Then 2 weeks ago I stopped masturbaiting for a week bc I was going over to a girls house to have sex. We start foreplay and I’m hard as a rock so I go to stick it in her and as I’m searching for the hole for less than 10 seconds I just feel my penis go soft in my hand, over the next hour we try 2 more times but same results every time. I did not put it in her once, the amount of embarrassment I felt was unbearable I did not know what to do I couldn’t please a girl I really wanted to be with I wanted to cry. Now I haven’t talked to her since probably never will and I have this incredible amount of rage built up from the embarrassment and not ejaculating. That’s why I’m here I found this community from searching up my problem and concluded I have PIED. I’m going to reboot on hard mode for 90 days (I fear that it might take longer for me), finish what I started and try my hardest to live a new life without porn and masturbation in moderation (once a month if I can do it without porn).

27332,Motivation,Here's a tip when you're having a really strong urge,If you're inside a room or in a bathroom with a phone on your hand and feel like watching porn. Always ALWAYS think that it's never worthy of fapping. Imagine the life you have ahead of you. The potential of becoming successful one day and having the dream girl you always needed. Imagine that..That one time you fapped you ruined everything. Admit it that everytime you relapse you always say that this will be the last time. That you will change and become a real man. But honestly when you're in a pretty good streak and everything seems so fine you will think about it. Your brain will spoil you thinking that it's fine just this one time to pleasure yourself. NEVER. Never let your brain tell you what to do. You are the alpha. You should be the one who will be obeyed. Once you control the power of your mind it will be easier to fight urges. Just ALWAYS think it's never worthy with just one fap. It will destroy your entire being. Beat your streak not your meat. Goodluck everyone.,127,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aizmr2/heres_a_tip_when_youre_having_a_really_strong_urge/

My real problem is the pornography, it sets unrealistic standards for my views on women and my own body and self; I tend to judge and fantasize and I'm ready to let go of my inhibitions. I'm ready to open my eyes and be the person I know I can be. I'm also starting a job soon and I'm tired of showing up places with shame written on my face. I know not fapping is not going to make me a better person, but it's a step in the right direction and a step I've put off for too long, but I'm glad I knew where to come. So I'm going to stay plugged in to this subreddit and I'm not going to fap. Wish me luck my fellow nofap-ers

I started nofap because I noticed jerking off made me less productive and confident. I’ve already started noticing the benefits (more confidence). Today I asked my crush out and she said yes. We went to the park and she gave me a blowjob (not to mention I haven’t even kissed a girl 1 month before this). Thanks to this subreddit, nofap has taught me that I should stop being a pussy, be more assertive, and ask for what I want. Without nofap, I wouldn’t have gotten my dick sucked. That’s all folks",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aj02r1/more_confidence/
27369,Telling my Story,Why I am doing NoFap,"Since highschool, I had developed some really bad habits. I used to smoke 1-2 fags a day, smoke weed for 1-2 months regularly then quit for 3-4 months and start again for 1-2 months. I never developed a drinking habit but I definitely drank on occasions like high school parties and sometimes with friends. I have definitely developed a really bad habit of eating lots of fast food and junk food and the worst habit we all know, the PMO addiction.

I have completely given up tobacco, alcohol and weed in the past 2 years but eating unhealthy and watching porn have stuck around. I have had these addictions for a very long time. Even before I started smoking or drinking, I was eating unhealthy and watching a lot of porn.

I had a girlfriend in high school and I specifically remember this one time when we were getting it on, I was asking her to moan as I was not able to enjoy as much as I had expected. Even at that time, I knew that it was because of porn as I had seen a TEDx talk I think about this at that time, but I never really stopped watching porn. I'm still a virgin btw.

Now I'm in my last semester of college and I have been single for a long time since I was dumped by my ex. I have only had that 1 girlfriend so far and I only intend to meet my life partner next. I also want to establish my career and lose fat. If I want to establish a career, lose fat and meet my life partner, I will have to give up my last 2 addictions of eating unhealthy food and watching porn.

NoFap will give me the energy, self-confidence and determination to achieve all these goals which are by any stretch of the imagination normal life goals. Not only that but NoFap will also help me in enjoying sex with my life partner more and in a natural way. I won't be needing her to perform like a pornstar for me. I want to use all of the energy and the spiritual journey that NoFap would take me through, to become the best version of myself. I never want to watch porn or fap by myself again in my entire life. If I am going to have any kind of release, it will be with my life partner and those are the reasons why I'm doing NoFap.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aj06u2/why_i_am_doing_nofap/

27396,Journal Check-In,Starting Day 6,"Days 3-5 have been clean, but hard.  Day 3 is when the urges first started rearing their ugly faces again, and since then, it’s been a struggle to keep my will to quit stronger than my urge to give in.  

Staying away from video gaming is also proving to be difficult.  Removing my two unhealthy numbing agents and escapist methods is forcing me to confront my reality.  My normal way to deal with the anxiety caused by the negative parts of my life is to drown myself in a day (or days) of video gaming, jumping from one game to another and tricking myself into a false sense of productivity and accomplishment while benefiting from the dopamine rush of a mission accomplished or match victory.  

The fact that there’s nothing inherently ‘wrong’ with video gaming is making it even harder to resist the urge to pop on a game.  “Just a match or two,” or “A half hour won’t hurt” or “Its just fun recreation, if you control it, it can’t hurt you” are the common phrases coursing through my head.  Again, while there’s nothing wrong with video gaming, the mentality that it promotes for me is the mentality that sends me to PMO and feeds that addiction.  I need to rid myself of it.

Whether or not I’ll return to video gaming in the future is something I don’t know and really can’t afford to worry about.  

All I know is, my body’s desperate for some sort of relief, ‘ideally’ in the form of another numbing agent.  But that which doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.  Numbing yourself to avoid your pain and problems doesn’t make you stronger or healthier.   It makes you weaker.

So since my brain and it's chemistry is being rebooted, even on bad days were the urges are taking control we all still experience the little things with a different perspective or feeling we could say. For example; the music is more enjoyable, the food(I do experience this and enjoy more eating delicious food), sleeping and many other things. What saved me yesterday was SNL. I've never liked SNL that much, but yesterday by miracle I was watching some sketches and maaaaan I was losing it, I got dizzy of laughing so hard. And after a good laugh I was ""OK"" and the urges gone, think is probably because while laughing I released a ton of dopamine and that helped.

Its snowing heavily where I live so going out isn't really a option because I'm not well at the moment. 

I'm also home alone.

The old me would of went downstairs, put on netflix, watched an nsfw movie, then searched pornhub, turned the volume up to max and jerked off like a lonely fool.

After, I would have felt like an emotional wreck who wants to kill himself. But no, 

I didn't do this and Instead I decided to channel my energy elsewhere, I cleaned my bedroom properly from top to bottom, I sorted all my clothes out that were all over my room, washed the ones that needed to be washed and then went to the washroom to shave. 

Prior to shaving I realised that my hair was all over the sink, so I began to clean the sink, I ended up cleaning the whole washroom and the bathroom aswell. I then went and cleaned myself aswell by having a shower.

The point is, I didn't jerk myself off and decided instead to channel all that energy from being horny elsewhere. And before writing this I also worked out.

27464,Advice to NoFap,Advice: Be Especially Cautious and Aware During Tough Times! (I beat a massive urge!),"So I'm at day 55. Yesterday I almost relapsed. Today was tough too. 

The reason? Cos I've been sick for 11 days now. Common cold. I'm feelig shitty in general, and that makes everything else seem pointless too. Since I'm not currently feeling any benefits, it seems pointless to keep the streak going. I just want to feel better, and a wank really seems like an easy way to achieve that.

It doesn't help that due to sickness I haven't been able to keep to my other kickass habits that I've incorporated in my life like waking up at 4:30, hitting the gym and sauna every morning at 6am, and then hustling away on my business. The whole existance just seems pointless and frustrating. I feel as if someone is stealing my life away. 

So my main piece of advice from this situation:

**Be especially careful when you're feeling down, whether it's for physical or mental reasons. Relapsing is so much easier then. I really didn't think there's any way I could come as close to relapsing as I did yesterday. I thought i'm way over it. Your brain will use the dirtiest tricks you can't even imagine to exist to try to take you down.**

But! I'm still here brothers! I didn't fail! And I won't! 

I've improved every single area of my life in insane amounts over the last few months and nofap is the cornerstone on which it's built. I'm scared to death about falling back to my old ways. I know hell, and I won't ever go back there again. 

Stay strong brothers, and thanks for everyone's support.

I'm new to reddit. Howerver, I have followed this sub for a year or so and had many, many failed streaks so far. They all failed somwhere around the 14 day mark.

So I started a new streak this monday and today i talked to a girl who rejected me around two years ago. I said something dumb and it got awkward. Very. Awkward. But instead of being frustrated and jerking off, this encounter gave me more motivation than ever. I don't want to be awkward anymore.

I realized that bad experiences are not a reason to be mad at yourself and masturbate out of frustration. You have to use these awkward situations as a sort of fuel to motivate yourself. To become a better you. To start NoFap. To not be the ""weird guy"" anymore. I think that this realisation will help me to hit the 90 day mark.

Since last week I can say I have still successfully managed to avoid activation of my addictive pathways in any regard, and have hence had a really easy time (no snowballing dopamine chasing). Some of my daily practises were disrupted at one point due to some social functions but they are now back on track seamlessly. I have been a bit more disorganized and have noticed a dip in my productivity due to narrow focus on a particular project with a deadline at the end of the week, but other than that my motivation has certainly bounced back from the initial low I typically experience after the dopamine from a relapse clears up (around days 5-7). I did also notice during the initial hurdle, a modification in my behaviour that had me more angry than usual (around days 8-10), which has also cleared up.

My triathlon training is going well, ran 6 miles yesterday doing some drills on the treadmill and working on initial endurance. I also got some practise in the pool. I still haven't returned to climbing due to an injury but I've been working on recovery. My daily meditations are going, I've noticed an increase in the relaxation and dopamine I acquire from it. I have noticed an increase in, let's call them urges for lack of a better term here (not comparable to the urges I used to receive stemming from incentive salience and snowball effect), which I correlate closely to an increases in libido.

27712,Relapse Report,Relapse after 228 Days - Here are my toughts,"Disclaimer: i think this got pretty long and random because i was just throwing thoughts at the keyboard sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

20y/o here. This was my 2nd somewhat longer streak with the other one being 64 days around 2 years ago in Febuary (seems like the lonely winter always gets me), most streaks between the two didn't really last longer than 10 days. Started the streak back in june because i was feeling heavily addicted, fapping atleast twice per day, and looking at porn on my phone troughout the day when i was not at home. I wanted to stop this and also i hoped the ""nofap superpowers"" would kick in and help me with my exams.

The first like two weeks were super hard, as most of you probably expirienced yourself, after that it got easier. I could notice the brain fog fading after a few days and noticed that i wasn't thinking about porn and jerking of all day while doing other stuff anymore which i think really did help with learning and concentrating on the exams, which was really nice. After around the 30 mark exams were over and i was super proud of myself for handeling them well and ofcourse for reaching 30 days again after over a year.

However while this was all going well, after around the 40 days mark i would say i started a heavy depressive episode that lasted from like end of july til mid of november, and i think this played a massiv part in me reaching such a high streak because in that time, pretty much all of my desire for pmo shifted to a desire for love and affection. This inturn gave me a thought when the desire for porn came somewhat back and it was ""The next time i'm gonna cum i won't be a virgin anymore"" and this was a huge one, the believe in this was probably what got me from around mid September til today.

NoFap wise all was going well and easy until last week, i was thinking i will atleast do the full 365 easily and then see what comes next, but as you can see from this post that ofcourse didn't happen. Last week i got a wet dream which i don't think breaks your streak or something it's a natural process, i mean i didn't empty my nuts since over 220 days somewhere the stuff has to go. The problem with this was tho that after waking up from the orgasm i got a super high desire for pmo again, i was edging every day since then always thinking ""no you can't do this if you don't stop you are going to come eventually"" and this is exactly what happed today, so guys i guess the lesson is don't edge.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i don't really know where to go from here, if i should just start right back into the next hardmode pmo streak or since i really don't feel like and addict anymore try if i can now live healthy with pmo, i thinnk it will be the first option but i know more in the coming days. As for the NoFap benefits like i said i noticed a big difference in the way i think and what i think about, however that was the only BIG difference i noticed, i think i got a bit more confident but i don't feel like that had something to do with nofap, and that was about it, i am sure i need to do way more than just nofap to change my life and get out of depression and all that shit, i want to start working out in march after exams so that will be a new big change of lifestlye.

&amp;#x200B;

This got pretty long and random so i think imma end it here for now, thank you to every one who read trough all of it, if i remember something import i will edit it in later on.

Theres a lot of triggers that led me to pmo. Also, do something productive. Clean your room, exercise, cook something, do the laundry, read a book, etc. Doing something productive will release dopamine, and help out a lot with your urges. Also another thing I did was text an old friend of mine from high school and just encourage him. As of now he's just a bum with no job and is living with his parents. I'm trying to encourage him to further his education and move forward in life. Spilling out positive energy on someone will not only make them feel better, but it'll also make you feel a lot better as well.

27754,Advice to NoFap,[NSFW] Advice on indulging in fetishes during nofap?,"NSFW content ahead, don't read on if you might be triggered.

A bit of background about me, I am 20 and have been watching porn since I was 12. I have had a foot fetish since before I first watched porn, but I developed other fetishes which have been induced by porn. My strongest fetish is for tickling and I honestly can't tell if that one is porn induced or came before, I just remember the first time I came across a tickling video and I knew instantly that I liked it. More recently I have developed a cuckold fetish, which is definitely porn induced and definitely something I want to get rid of.

When me and my GF have sex I usually do stuff with her feet and tickle her. However, I am starting to wonder if during NoFap I should even be indulging these fetishes at all? I can't tell if they will always be a part of me no matter what and there's nothing wrong with indulging in them during sex as long as I stay away from PMO, or if I should try to get rid of them all together and abstain from indulging in them. 

Some advice would be much appreciated. Is it possible to get rid of these fetishes or should I accept them as part of my sexuality so long as I stay away from PMO?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aj5205/nsfw_advice_on_indulging_in_fetishes_during_nofap/

27771,Advice to NoFap,Unpopular opinion,"I think keeping track of how many days you've been doing no PMO is bound to make you relapse one day, thinking that you have a big number under your belt (pun intended) you won't fail if you take a quick glimpse at porn. Also the the bigger the number the bigger the anxiety you'll have that you might break it. And lastly and maybe the worst you might not try again if you break a long streak because you'll feel that you'll never get there again. 

I think that just as you didn't count the days when you believed that PMO is normal and fapped everyday and didn't care much, everyone shouldn't keep count because this is just your new norm and you're just a guy who stays away from PMO and would rather use dopamine to do things that matter rather than waste it. 

I remember watching a seminar about quitting smoking a couple of years ago (2 months no smoking now) that focused on not calling yourself an ex smoker or if someone asks you you say I quit, you actually say that you're a non-smoker which help solidify the decision you took. 

So with the same logic I believe that keeping count doesn't actually help but even worse it might make it harder.

27830,Journal Check-In,"Day 1# - NO GIRLS, ONLY GOALS 31 DAYS CHALLENGE","I grounded some rules:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Focus on my goals and tasks, don't speak to women

\-Be playful nonetheless, but don't approach any girl. Talk to them if they talk to you. 

\-Plan your day so you know what you are doing at any point of day.

\-If you find a girl that approaches you attractive, tell her that you're busy (goals first!) and get her number. Continue working on what you're doing. Ask her out a few days later if you want. But no texting in between!

\-Only talk to them if they talk to you

\-Don't blame yourself if you end up looking at a girl, getting stressed around them and make plenty of mistakes. You're learning , and you need to allow yourself to fail.

I also started a new job today. There were plenty of women there, to which I simply said hi and carried on my tasks.

I bought a bike for myself today.  I hadn't cycled in 20 days and the feeling was better than an orgasm. I kid you not. Maybe finding what you enjoy doing without the need of having anyone else doing it with you is the thing you should focus on more. We'll see

In a world that takes the negative consequences of pornography and masturbation lightly, jokingly...even passing it off under a banner of “liberation,” seldom do we find men nowadays who are willing to practice self-control for the good of themselves and of others.

It's amazing. 

Nofap is one of the best communities I found through the Internet.

It's a shame I used to think this community was filled with people who tries too hard but dam I was wrong. So wrong.

I have tried getting on nofap before but I have always failed. 2 days, 3 days, relapse. Depressed. Rinse &amp; repeat.

That all changed when I discovered this community &amp; started really getting myself involved in it.

I never looked back since. Now I'm nearly 5 months clean after a 10 year long addiction to PMO. It ain't much but I will always be here to support other fellow fapstronauts who are still fighting to get on this journey.

28118,Advice to NoFap,"Fitness, The Drive and Monk Mode","Nofap motivates many of us to improve ourselves and resist our urges in the gym.  In the past 3 months I’ve undergone a serious fitness transformation that’s altered my body, mood, energy, endurance and physiology. Here’s some things to watch out for, for all you guys improving yourself in the gym: 

Adipose (fat) cells contain an enzyme called aromatase which converts testosterone into estrogen.  Being overweight makes you tired, sluggish, mentally foggy and most of all depleted of your own natural testosterone levels just like PMO. Getting rid of fat increases your passive T-levels. In addition, lifting weights and participating in intense exercise circumstantially increases testosterone. 

If you lose a lot of weight, start exercising hard and frequently, and start putting on muscle, this journey can provide you a blessing and a curse: 

Blessing: Superpowers, confidence, less anxiety, energy, swagger, concentration, sensory improvement, dopamine regulation, strong and well integrated sex drive. 

Curse: Anger, aggression, intimidating presence and a sex drive that doesn’t nag you like before your transformation, doesn’t irritate you like before you got lean, doesn’t taunt you like before you put on muscle. It possesses you.

This time around new me gave up porn easily. Im giving up orgasm with some dedication. But since my transformation on Nofap if I don’t edge for the first few days I become a verbally aggressive short fused manic sex addict.  It’s very “alpha” but it’s hard to control. I’ve felt these symptoms around day 23 but it’s only day 9. 

If you’ve been tested and have a high t level (....), are trying no PMO and don’t have a significant other lined up, I would recommend monk mode for the first month to two months because I’m so motivated to go get laid it tunnel visions my psyche and threatens other parts of a balanced life.  Inconsistent success on dating apps, PUA and a sex drive like a car on fire speeding through the desert for water are a bad mix for self esteem and self improvement. The urge is so distracting I feel like I could be putting away sexuality altogether, get more benefits and prevent any sense of neediness with women because quite frankly I’d love to cum with all my soul.

Consider monk mode, lifting heavy things and then approaching the women when you’re really grounded in your new self.",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aj81ri/fitness_the_drive_and_monk_mode/

28215,Relapse Report,Going to reset.... what irony,"So on 'Day 19' I'm going to reset.

It's been my longest streak. I haven't seen any content produced by the porn industry. I haven't masturbated. I haven't orgasmed.

Before nofap, I did watch porn a lot, but I was masturbating a lot too. And rarely would my first one of the day be to porn, but to text. Not erotic literature, but to highly sexual conversations I'd have on apps.

Sadly, this community is a trigger for that and facilitates something too similar. This is not a reflection on the guys posting here, but on my own weaknesses. I think there has been a lot of content here which has aroused me, and I feel given its similarity to my previous preference for material, my brain has not been recovering. Frankly I've been embracing the arousal this forum has provided. And so, it's time to admit that this whole time, I have actually been consuming my own brand of 'porn'.

I've made a lot of progress though, just not exactly the right kind. So I'm looking forward to a particularly unusual type of Day One. I have lots of benefits still intact, lots of challenges still intact, but I think a reset is the right thing to do.

I'm going to work shortly, so I will be keeping the app for the next 6 hours or so, to see your responses. And then will delete it. Maybe I'll be back at Day 30! Sadly it won't come next week, but in a month.

28373,Motivation,NoFap is like launching a rocket,"This is for all the people that have very low day counts, either you've just started or you constantly find yourself having to reset every couple of days. The 90 day goal seems impossible because simply going 2-3 days is a struggle. I've been there and I'm going to share my experience with y'all in hopes it will help.

First you have to set yourself up for success, invest in building a rocket (life) that can go the distance. This means limiting distractions and maximizes fulfilling hobbies and productive time. Things will get tough especially during the intial launch and if there are cracks in your life PMO will seep in and suffocate you.

Realize that just like a rocket ship, the beginning of the journey is the hardest. Gravity holds you in place, an object at rest tends to stay at rest. If you've been resting your whole life it's going to take a lot of work upfront to change that. The good news is that the reverse is also true, once you start to gain momentum and escape the gravity well things begin to get a lot easier. The first few weeks of NoFap are by far the most difficult, the positives haven't really started to take affect yet and your brain craves it's dopamine hit. 

Remember: Everytime feel that craving don't try to suppress it, acknowledge it, accept it but do not act on it. Move on from it. I like using the 5 second rule, if you have any sexual thought or fantasy move on within 5 seconds from it. Eventually you'll train your brain that bringing up these sexual thoughts doesn't lead anywhere. It took me many streaks of practicing this but it's an effective way to rewire fucked up dopamine paths you've ingrained over the years.

I am at the point that I could never see from my repetitive short streaks (ranging from 2-17 days), a point where relapsing is hardly a consideration because of all the positives that have come to my life. I don't want to say I'm free from PMO but for the first time I legitimately can see myself never doing it again. There's just no reason to. I just want to let y'all know that it gets easier, and way less of a struggle if you work hard, build a strong ship to go the distance and push through the edges of the gravity well to space.

28385,Other,Anatomy of Urge,"Thirst or hunger is always evidence of a greater need. Need in our case is not sexual but both physical and psychological. Masturbation made our minds conditional to it like cocaine. Thus, to feel normal, in-bound, relaxed, and calm we need it. It won't eliminate it forever because it's not the point. The point is to create demand then supply. A cycle. 
That explains why we feel out of place and overwhelmed with anxiety after a timely abstinence (say 2 weeks on). Our physical brain has literally no idea how it should go on without this equalizer thus forcing us to provide it with a stimulant, specifically porn along with masturbation. You don't give in but it keeps on craving. It fills you with stress and put you in an emergency-like state.

28447,Advice to NoFap,Protip: limit your browsing time per day,"In my opinion, mindless browsing is just as bad as PMO; it wastes valuable hours in the day, it lowers your attention span as you read headlines here and there without actually concentrating to read whole pages like when reading a regular book, and in the end it makes you bored and anxious and might even lead to PMO as the ultimate boredom hits the fan. So limit your browsing hours to 30-60 mins per day and replace the extra free time with some other activity like reading, not on the screen, but an actual physical book.

If we are to change our lives and our minds, we have to stop doing things we've done in the past that have lead to PMO.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajbt3e/protip_limit_your_browsing_time_per_day/

28483,New to NoFap,Day 14,"Hello everyone, 

My name is Constantinos and it hasn't been long since I first discovered this subreddit.
The first time I realised that I am addicted to pornography was during the Christmas season, when I caught myself watching porn for six straight hours without even feeling the need to masturbate. 

To be sincere, I have to admit that  I always enjoyed watching porn, it really seemed like a form of art to me,  especially high end productions such as Marc Dorcel's. 

Later that night, while in my sleep, I found myself dreaming about watching porn online, an event that made me think  me and ultimately lead me into the realisation that I should no longer spend time watching porn. I then decided to set up a personal goal of no fapping for at least 30 days as my previous record was 21 days (when in the army). 
I recalled myself not having the time to watch porn when being a student, always following classes and lectures, working, exercising, hanging out with friends and flirting occasionally. 
I remember myself being so energetic and passionate about pretty much everything, always giving my best, setting goals, facing challenges and extending my personal limits.

I have now completed 14 days without feeling the urge to browse porn and the energy levels are starting to increment. I feel more confident and self sufficient. 

I would like to thank you for persuading me into this mindset and also thank you for making me remember that there is an infinite amount of personal potential if you surround yourself with optimism and at the same time, avoid the nihilistic and toxic opinions and paradigms that society, TV and social media so vigorously tries to make us consider and  follow.

28550,Success Story,"Today I woke up with one of the biggest, hardest morning wood ever and...","I realized that the reason was I was so excited was that for the first time I hit 45 days!!

I first fapped when I was in middle school (11-12 y/o) and have basically PMO’d 2-3 times a day since.

Fast forward to 22 years old, I learned about no fap Dec 2017. It was eye opening and I wanted to give it a shot! Why not? But last year (2018) I never got past a streak of 20 days but PMO’d much less often than I did every year prior.

Now 24, (my birthday was in December) I decided on 12/9/18 that I was no longer going to continue half-assing anything in my life. I went all in- fitness goals, PMO goals, financial goals, etc.

Today, I’m happy to say that I’m a totally different person from just 45 days ago, and it drives me to want to hit more!!

Things that have changed about me: my hazel eyes pop like no other, I had to make personal biz cards because people keep wanting to hire me/connect with me, I’m absolutely killing it in sales, my communication skills have drastically improved, my confidence is through the roof, my eye contact is unreal, I have had 3 girls ask ME for my number in the past 2 weeks, I quit video games, I wake up every day at 5AM, I take cold showers everyday, I’ve lost 14 lbs of fat from hitting the gym or exercising no less than 6 days a week, I’m almost done reading my first book in years, and I started leading people around me- people are noticeably modeling my behavior and asking to be around me more.

I can’t help but thank this community. I’ve gone from a sheep that constantly suppressed his innate giftedness with PMO multiple times a day, to a lion that’s trailblazing an incredible life for myself.

I’m 1/2 way to my first mile mark, but 1/8 of the way to my first goal. I’m committed to making this year the first year without PMO.

Thank you for reading, I love sharing here because everyone is so supportive! For those struggling, just remember that it is NEVER worth it. If you could feel how I feel right now, you’d never PMO again. The only thing stopping you from getting to where you want to go is yourself and the small decision that you make when your down, upset, tired, or out of it. Stay focused, understand what you truly want, and go after it!! If I can do it, you can too!!

I have definitely gotten out of the poor habit of PMO. The P part has been the hardest. as I had the habit of just searching for nudes whenever I was bored. Have been on my way to do this again at various times. Even had a look at the start page of a few sites, but not taken it further. Some would argue that this counts as a relapse; but I'm doing this for me and no one else. I set my rules and goals.

My goal with r/NoFap was not to never masturbate ever again, just get rid of the habit of watching porn and masturbating whenever I felt down or was bored.  I might turn more into *just*  r/PornFree later, but not sure now when or why I would want to masturbate. 

Never thought the super powers some felt were real, and cannot say I have felt much of what some of you've described. But I'm fine with that. I wasn't a daily faper as some here.

28611,Telling my Story,My story so far.,"Here’s my story as a normal 16 year old boy.

A bit of background -
I’m fairly shy and quiet, often cringy (unintentionally) low ok self confidence and terrible at taking to girls.

I first discovered PMO 3 years ago. It started after a horrible horrible relationship and I fell into the trap.

I’ve been addicted for 3 years. 

I’ve tried to beat this addiction for the last 3 years and relapsed about every week.

Last year that changed.

I discovered the NoFap community on Reddit. It has honestly changed me. The support people give in here is incredible.

My highest ever streak was 50 days. Last November I thought I had conquered this. My mind was clear, I was fresh, the days behind me were gone and I was certain I had beaten this addiction for good.

This is when last week my ‘friends’ were MOCKING me for having a good streak! Like WTF!?

I received comments like:
- Your gonna get prostrate cancer
- Your gonna get erectile disfunction  
- You need to wank bro

I’m afraid this got to me as I fell into the trap that masturbation is good for me and relapsed. And relapsed the next day and then 3 days later and then again the next day. 

However, I went from being somebody who was free to somebody who is addicted again in the space of a week.

My advice - DON’T RELAPSE WHATSOEVER.

I’m now starting from scratch for probably the 100th time to get a good streak going again. Once I do I’m certain I will be free

Stay strong 👍

28615,Advice to NoFap,New strategy! I hope it works,"I always had some problem to define when I have to reset the counter. 

In my mind I know that taking small peaks or edging is bad, but if I reset the counter every time I do that,  my brain will tell me: ""***Hey, you're resetting the counter! Why don't you masturbate?***""

&amp;#x200B;

In order to avoid that I decide to keep two different counters:

\- One for PMO

\- One for small peak (I also include Instagram, because in my opinion is porn)

I hope it will work and I can finally reach my 90 days!

28649,Motivate Me,Hi reddit fam! I need help.,"So this is my first time trying this, I’m a woman who has been struggling extremely hard to avoid masturbation. I do not watch porn but I masturbate and it makes me feel like SHIT. I want to stop it and the longest I’ve gone without it is 6 months but then I relapsed :( before you suggest something, I think here’s what you need to know about me; 
I’m 23 years old. I’m happily committed to a very loving boyfriend but we’re not physical. I haven’t talked about it to anyone until today. I’m a religious person but not an extremist. I gave up the habit of watching porn many years ago but I don’t find a proper explanation to stop masturbating. When I get bored or when I’m depressed, I think why would anyone mind if I just do ‘the act of hand’, I tell myself that it’s like taking a dump or this is how we were made but when I get an orgasm right after that I start having this guilt. But that guilt is not just enough to stop me. Every time I think that the next time I won’t do it, I would meditate instead but it doesn’t go that way. The guilt that I talked about, I think I feel like I’m being ungrateful. I don’t know why, because whenever something great happens I never celebrate it by masturbating so I think that I became ungrateful. The day after the deed is usually very upsetting and disappointing for me. I feel like I’m not a good person only because I couldn’t do what I wanted to do. Sometimes I struggle so damn hard in that ‘very moment’ to stop myself but I can’t and it ends up happening. I masturbate maybe 3-4 times a month but it makes me feel bad that sometimes it controls me and I do it. I want to be able to control it. I read some stories here and I thought maybe someone could tell me what I could do about it? ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajeyia/hi_reddit_fam_i_need_help/
28653,Telling my Story,Just had my first (5) NEOs (Non-ejaculatory Orgasm),"So I have been practicing NoFap Hardmode for about a month.  First streak was 16 days (Had one slip, but that's it and got right back on) and now I'm at 10 days.  

I've been practicing Taoist techniques to transmute the energy.  Well today I tried to experience an NEO.  I was touching myself (without Porn) and basically kept edging, and everytime I got close I would sqeeze my PC muscles and bring the orgasmic energy up my spine. 

After a few tries of this my entire body was enveloped in pleasure.  Everytime I would pull the energy into my head I would experience a full-body orgasm MUCH more powerful than ANY EO I've had.  I was literally convulsing and the orgasms would last 30 seconds to a minute.  

I experienced this about 5 times in a row, and at that point I was done...couldn't keep going lol

I was simultaneously laughing and crying at what I had just experienced!  I felt like I just found the Holy Grail!  

I'm SO excited because this means that when I'm super horny I can still experience orgasm and those urges dissipate without losing my energy through ejaculating.  I also feel super energized and enthusiastic today after this morning!

Give this a try guys!  It's not as hard as you think and it feels AMAZING!  Normally I would be against edging but this actually relieves the tension and urges of being hyper-horny due to semen retention.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajeytw/just_had_my_first_5_neos_nonejaculatory_orgasm/
28654,Motivation,I gave a 100 dollar tip!! Nofap will get me bankrupt,"I'm not sure what's happening to me, but I'm so aware of the people around me these past few days. Their body language, feelings, individual markers of handsomeness and beauty.

Today I was in such a good mood guys, words can't explain (properly because I was fighting urges past two nights and I Won). Anyway, I went to this restaurant and couldn't but notice how miserable the older lady serving me looked. I honestly don't know what got into me, but I felt I was telepathically talking to her soul the whole time. I sensed so much pain and struggle and thought to myself, I have to make her smile by hock of by crock.

So, once I paid for my meal (27.5 dollar), I left her a 100. Guys I can't express the joy and happiness on her face, it sure was worth all the money I had on that instance. That fact that she was feeling happier even if for a short fraction of time, is satisfying.

Not 10 minutes ago, I layed down to masturbate, but I realized that I was really sick of it.

Started no pmo again Jan 11/2019
Goal date is July 10

I am going to start to journal my journey again. 
Last year I started nofap and had a stretch of nofapping for over 90 days and then finally failed.  I have let this slide for a bit and I am back on the band wagon.  I am currently on day 13 of no pmo.  Things I have learned from the first time I did this. 

-This is hard
-Your mind will play tricks on you to get you to look at porn and masterbate
-There will be nights you can't fall asleep
-Your body will give you signals that you want to masterbate

Things I did to help myself last no fap, one of the biggest things I noticed. 

-I recruted a friend to make me accountable and somebody I could check in with when times got hard
-After the 60 day mark, my energy changed from wanting you use pmo, to wanting to share me sexual energy with my partner and not with myself. I found it to be a turn on.  

So again I ask for your support,  In my journey. I made it 90 days, this time my challenge is 180 days. 
Dont wish me luck, hold me accountable for what I am doing and saying.  Dont let me slide back to porn and self pleasure.

28711,Motivation,It’s bigger than nofap,"I’ve been on and off from nofap for a few months now. Only reached 30+ days twice. 

Until I changed my perspective of why I am doing it...

It’s easy to glorify the process and give it too much importance and attention. The problem with that is that even though we are trying to better ourselves, we revolve around the idea of no fapping (aka thinking about fapping, orgasms, streaks, ‘superpowers,’ etc)

Through meditation and other practices, I came to the realization that we are already complete! That the benefits are always within us we just gotta unlock them and use them to anything we want to achieve. 


I stopped giving it importance, i just began to be more aware and mindful of the very present moment. Not necessarily being scared or worrying if I ever was going to break the streak again. 

I’m on day 36 right now and it has never been easier. I feel amazing! Nofap was just a result behavior from unlocking our true nature of who we really are!

my goal is 90 days but my friend said that you should start with small targets so what are you guys' opinion on that?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajg1wa/day_1_problemz/
28722,Relapse Report,"I relapsed, but I wouldn't name it a bad thing overall","So yeah, I fell pretty flat on my face after 16 days of my first streak, relapsing fully (though through only one act of PMO, and I refuse to go down the slide of doing it over and over). As the title says, I (in my relative inexperience on NoFap) would not say this relapse is all that bad - of course, I'd rather not have done it and quitted PMO definitively. But I realise it's not about just dropping a habit for 90 days, it's a journey to stop, in my case forever.

The relapse did put me to think deeper on the reboot and the way I handled it during these first 2 weeks. I had urges that I was fighting off, because, as I told myself, they will stop, you'll soon be feeling like a better person and you can make it to the end. That was wrong - I don't think the urges will stop, at least not on this short term. I was already feeling like a better person, but that was not because of the number of days I'd gone clean: it was about me consciously facing and trying to beat an addiction. And I can't just make it to the end. Firstly, 90 days without a deeply ingrained habit is hard and difficult to quit cold turkey - I was bound to err at one point or another. Secondly, and this is the main point I've realised and which has made me strengthen my resolve: there's no making it to the end when there is no end.

The goal (or, well, at least *my* goal) is to quit PMO definitively, not to hold out for a while and then go back to old or slightly toned-down habits. And that has been the culprit for me, I feel: I was working on avoiding PMO, not on quitting PMO. I was finding ways to not commit PMO, rather than finding solutions to not want or need PMO. Sure, I was following the usual tips - cold showers, exercise, staying mentally engaged (exam week in the final year of my bachelor's degree helps a lot with that). But I was doing the right things on the wrong path.

So, in that sense, I'm glad to have relapsed, since it has made me realise my error relatively early on - and, don't get me wrong, it's also taught me how much regret relapses cause. But every step on this journey is a moment to reflect and learn, and this is one of those moments. I don't want this relapse to be a miserable story of how I failed for the first time, I want it to be the moment when I realised how much these first 16 days have already achieved.

I'm so frustrated I want to hurt myself. I know no one will commment on this or upvote it, I don't give a fuck. I need to write this out for myself. I am so determined to get to 90 days I need to write this to distract myself. I hate everyone in this fucking world. I can't kill myself because I keep having this voice in my head say "" If you die then who will play the music in your head?"" and I hate it. I just want it to go away so I can kill myself and be at peace. I hate everyone. I hate my family even though they're so loving. I hate my church and everyone in it. I hate everyone I work with I hate my life. I cannot let this go this is just who I am . All I do is ruin the relationships around me. I hate myself. I hate everything. I need to go. I need to not be like this but it's who I am. I am nothing. I pray everyday for God to kill me. He doesn't grant my prayer. I pray for therapy, He doesn't help. I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

And it's so stupid too because even though I'm feeling this emotion , I know in 14 days it'll be gone. I'll be on some other shit. I hate myself man. God if you only knew. I throw away everything. Every oppurtunity I have is just thrown away. I am a waste of space. I don't want to be here. Fuck everyone that tells me I need to be in therapy and then doesn't help me get there. Yes I've called the numbers. Nothing. No help. I get so anxious I can't even do it on my own. I'm so fucking weak. I need someone to do it for me. Then once I get there I'm so anxious I can't even talk about what I need to talk about. Even if I wanted to get on a medication I have no insurance to pay for the script. Fuck my life. I'm such a waste of space. 

Would you believe I'm 25? I'm so immature. Ever since I started nofap i've come across all these new emotions and theyre so fucking immature but I can't shake them and theyre going to ruin my life. I am completely out of control. I am out of control and I need help. No one cares. No ones actually there on the other end. Just a script. A nobody. I hate everything in this world. Please let me go God please for fucks sake kill me. Every day is just me throwing out every oppurtunity. I can't iiiifucking do it. All I want to do is die. That's the only thing I wish for myself. Death. Please its such a fantasy of mine. If I had the money I would make someone else do it for me. I've thought about buying a gun but I dont have the money. I need relief. 

Where the fuck is God? Everything I turn to isn't the same anymore. I hate the way treat me. I just want to be left alone. Fuck these little dumb red squiggilies that pop up when I haven't put an apostrophe. Everything is dumb. There is no point to anything. I hate everyone. Hate takes up too much energy. I \\m' tired all the time. I just want to not be here. There is no such thing as relief. I'm never going to make it. This all just leads up to me killing myself. I can't wait for when I actually follow through with it. I want to so bad but that fucking voice in my head it's the only thing. Why is that voice there? I hate everyone I don't even care about your opinions. I pray to God and get nothing. Im just supposed to make up all these blessings he's given me? Where? Where are your blessings?

Fuck this blonde haired girl ordering a coffee. I hate her. She should die. Not by me. I want to see the world burn in everything chaotic. I want to light this entire city on fire and burn everyone in it. Man I should jump off a building. If it wasnt for that fucking VOICE! Ahh! get out of my head! It's the only thing keeping me around. Fuck this old dude tipping the barista. I hate him because he's happy. I hate my roommate because she is happy. It truly confuses me some of the things she does. I'm like, ""Ohh that's what people who are happy do"" . It never computes. Why the fuck can't my wishes, dreams, ideas become a reality. I'm so fucking trapped. I feel like a freshman in high school. Why am i so angry? Yea dealing with child abuse in my past but I can't find anyone to talk about it with. I hate everything. I hate this girl I'm supposed to be with. She's so fucking dumb. Listening to her tell a story is the boringest thing in the world. 

Sex isn't even satisfying anymore. I can't find release. I hate everything. It's like my body wants this release but then once it comes it wasn't enough. I've stopped writing everyday.

28772,Advice to NoFap,"Today January 24th, I'm starting NoFap to become a doctor and change my life.","So to start with, I'm a native french speaker so I might do some little syntax errors here and there. 

Here my overall story on why I want to start this challenge. I wrote a lot more informations that I needed but at the same time, I've never talked about this to anyone so I want this out of me. 

I always had and still have this dream to become a doctor and achieve all my dreams. I consider myself capable of achieving such goal but I am  struggling with this intense lack of motivation toward studying and self discipline. I'm a person who is driven by stuff that I like or respect, I'm always trying my best to get and achieve what I want, always seeking new experiences and knowledge.  But so far, I've never really achieved anything that I'm proud of because I don't think I put enough effort and sacrifices to it. All that I have so far, that could make someone proud of himself or herself was given to me. My parents always had given me everything, even the job that is paying my everyday's expenses was given by my dad's company. My girlfriend off almost 3 years is giving me more love than I even deserve, and I'm here, fucking falling at the first real challenge that I encounter.

 This part is a little resume of  me since 2017.  
I live in Montreal and in our education system, we have CEGEP, which is a college to get a professional diploma or a pre-university diploma. Basically it just a step before university.  
Well, the immature, hard fapper,  me,  2 years ago, that always had it easy, started a pre-university program in order to get to med school. Holy sweet little jesus was I not ready for this since I was lacking in organisation and structure. I got kicked out  off school since I failed two semesters in a row. 



BACK TO NOFAP CHALLENGE.
Now I'm homeschooled since no college (CEGEP) want me in their classes and since I have no longer schedule or whatsoever, I desperately need a drastic change in my life habits, which mostly includes discipline and structure. Since I started my homeschool courses, I fell like shit everyday, I've tried many things so far , i've done many changes but nothing lasted very long and with few to no results, I have done a complete introspection of myself and the only issue is probably this crazy addiction to porn and NSFW subreddits. I Fap a shit loads of time since I'm always home doing my homework . 
So this is it, maybe my lack of motivation is due to massive addiction to dopamine and my brain is always asking for more, i mean, many times, I've used fapping to fall asleep from the feeling of relaxation after fapping or regularly fapping 3 times under 60 minutes.

I always found foolish the NoFap challenge but after reading many post on this subreddit, I told myself I wouldn't lose nothing if I give it a try. So this is it, I don't know if this will get any attention since I feel like its just a text of me whining to get attention and approval, which probably is Haha. But seriously I just need advice because I don't know where to start, I'm all open on suggestion, I really want this to work or I need this to work? 
Also, do I have an addiction?

28812,Question to NoFap,"Reading through the posts, I feel lucky to be here when I’m 15!","Knew about this place since I was 14, but towards the end of 14, and couldn’t hit 90 days or even an extremely long streak, but 2019 is my year and I hope when I turn 16 in October I won’t fap until then, and even after. Hoping to quit for good. 

Anyways, I had a wet dream I believe, I never had them before NoFap, I had one earlier at the start of the year and I woke up to orgasm without ejaculation, I don’t know how that happened, but I looked through posts and saw wet dreams were OK, because you’re not in control of your mind.

Just woke up to a wet dream, and I had ejaculated, but I don’t know if it is a relapse. In my dream, I don’t think it was lucid, but I knew about NoFap in my dream and knew I shouldn’t relapse, but without even masturbating or having sex in my dream, I woke up to orgasm and I’m like damn I didn’t even know about it, because I felt more alive when I woke up and if I had been fully conscious I would have told myself not to relapse. The dream was about sex, yes, but it didn’t involve touching myself or having sex with girls, just looking at imaginary images I believe it was. 

Is this a relapse? I’m pretty sure I was unconscious at the time. Also, will there be any negative effects of this?

I have no shame about the things I used to be self-conscious about. I exercise. I’ve read books. I’ve continuously worked on my aspiration to be a novelist and have written just about everyday.

Now I wake up every morning eager to take on the day. I don’t miss meals, I’m “present” in every encounter and conversation I find myself in. I’m teaching myself new things like the piano and guitar. I drink WATER! Not absurd amounts of coffee or energy drinks. No sugary drinks, no empty, fattening snacks, except the one or two rewards after a long productive day because honestly I deserve it. I cannot wait to see what more time under my belt will do. I cannot imagine the amazing person I can shape myself into with this momentum.

28864,Journal Check-In,Day 10 of current streak - Progress,"Last couple of days have been rough for me mentally, but due to personal life stuff rather than nofap. Still, I haven't had the urge to fap. I also haven't had random boners in public or such. I think the only boner I've had all day was morning wood. But if I'm wrong, I've still only had 1 or 2 random boners maximum today. The lack of sexual urges may have been due to the extreme sorrow I've experienced the last couple days though, but I don't think that's all there is to it. Why? Because especially today I've realized that my view on women is healthier than before: I don't view them as ""sex dolls"" or ""sex slaves"" anymore. (I just want to point out that by ""sex dolls"" or ""sex slaves"" I mean the idea caused by porn that women are all always up for sex and that that's their sole purpose. I've known for a loooong time that the idea is not true but my heart hasn't ""accepted"" that before.) I have now begun to understand in my heart that women are people just like me; with their own history, thoughts, emotions, rights that I need to respect, minds, goals, and other attributes that make them people, and that they have no obligations to me. I understand that I'm not entitled to anything from them, not even to a single 'hello'. I feel like I have only got started in this process of respecting women, but I'm so glad I've already got this far.

Peeing feels awesome, as weird as it sounds. I think it's at least partly due to the lack of boners. And I mean awesome in the way that it's so effortless and I think the tube is ""clean"", so to say, after not PMOing in so long. I guess it could also be about enjoying the small things in life, which so many others have mentioned on this subreddit.

I've also managed to do uni stuff more or less every day.

So that's basically how I'm doing right now: beginning to respect women, enjoying the small things in life, having more discipline. It's awesome.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajhsph/day_10_of_current_streak_progress/

28895,Question to NoFap,"No sex drive, will nofap help?","To give some background, im not entirely sure what happened, but I think I have an idea. Bit of a read, but useful info i think. 

So about 8 months ago I was a normal kid, ripe age of 18. Of course, I was as horny as any other kid, if not more. I would PMO at least once a day.

I ended up going to the doctor for something completely UNRELATED. Basically i got prescribed propranolol and soon after, my dick just stopped getting erections completely. I did some research, found out it was probably the drug, stopped taking it. 

Thing is, I was worried. And like a dumbass I continued to fap even though i wasnt getting natural erections any more, only weak ones through stimulation. My sex drive was gone, but i still masturbated.

This led to premature ejaculation. Basically i still continued to fap but i didnt have a sex drive and i wasnt taking the drug anymore. 

Anyway. Fast forward to now. Seen a doctor and they think my mental got messed up from being worried about my penis. I stopped masturbating but i still had sex with my girlfriend at least once a week, but i wasnt craving it. Basically just doing it for her, and if i wasnt getting constant stimulation i would go soft.

I decided to stop orgasming all together to see what happens. 
Ive stopped masturbating for the last 11 days and i still havent felt anything. I know 11 days isnt much, but i was wondering if no fap would bring my sex drive back? If so, anyone got an estimate of how long it will be? Thanks, appreciate anyone who reads through this. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aji34t/no_sex_drive_will_nofap_help/

Approaching Day 365

Let me start by saying that I am writing this on my phone so I apologize as it will not turn out how I want it to. My wife recently told me about the page so I figured I would stop by and share some words of wisdom.

I am a 30 yo Afghanistan war Veteran and let me tell you this, abstaining from pornography was the hardest thing that I had to do. But it was when I realized that I wasn’t alone in my struggle that I knew that I had the strength to rise above. It took hard work with therapy, self-control, and the rebuilding of trust in my relationship with my significant other to get where I am today. She was truly how I got through all of this. 

The influences are everywhere in our lives. To the point where I completely stopped using social media. I don’t use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram none of it. Because you will find a way to stimulate what you want at the end of the day.

That’s why places like this and people like us are so important. We have to continue to shed light on what the media is trying to make “normal” in our society. Prove that it is not normal. 
When you go without all of this stimulation, you seriously see life and people differently. You carry yourself with so much more confidence. Be proud of yourself that you are not tethered to mind control. Because that’s what pornography is, mind control. 
Every day you didn’t PMO, you achieved greatness. You are all superheroes.

So I’m sure the temptation wasn’t there as much as it is now, meaning that people would do it a lot less and be a lot less perverted.

That’s why it’s been sold as something that every does for years now, because they look back at the past and think “well our ancestors did it so it’s ok” but that’s because porn wasn’t around for 99.9999 percent of our history.

29022,Advice to NoFap,The Bigger Picture,"First, I write this out of the hope that the community may realize the insignificant of the counter, and more so, the big picture of NoFap. I'm by no means a saint, nor a master at abstaining from the horrors of this world, but I'm a work in progress and I've had an epiphany not so long ago. There's a small story following my relapse today which I'm going to share, hopefully this will unlock the mind and open the eyes, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.. and it only gets brighter.

On 1-19-19, I made a commitment to myself. I was going to do whatever it took to achieve the life I imagined, that involved purging out porn and masturbation all together. From that day is where my counter begins and will never be turned back. The following day, I had one of the best evenings of my life. My counter only shows a few days so far, which is small, but the road which one strives for greatness cannot be measured by a finite number. I ended up relapsing this morning but decided not to reset my counter at all, why? First what caused my relapse? I was browsing the internet last night, and I came across some websites, clicked on a link and there were a bunch of small nsfw images, I swiped right so fast and got outta there. I couldn't remember a single detail. From that moment onward, I was feeling guilty. But why? I didn't fap, nor did I stare at the images. It was that I had let myself down, I hold myself to a high standard and I caved. I fell asleep in that mental state, and woke up the same. I had broken my streak, it was time to turn back the clock. I contemplated moving forward but I just couldn't do that. I completed the relapse. My mind, disoriented by negative thoughts, led me to recall the promise I made, had disintegrated with the progress I'd made. That's an illusion tho, progress was not lost. Who we are (becoming) isn't measured again by a something finite. We're all greater than that number our badge displays. Life is chaotic, and due to that, we're going to slip up, we're gonna get hit. In life one can't reset when that happens, one can only move forward, holding dearly the promise that was made. That oath which was taken. From that very truth, is the reason why I chose not to reset my badge. Now I'm not saying to keep the counter running through binges and relapses of porn. Instead, what I'm stating is that if one is truly committed to bettering themselves and devoted to fixing their lives.. they shouldn't let NoFap's counter give them the impression that hope is lost, and progress erased. Because in reality, one cannot go back and reset ones choices. Own them, and move forward. Those special moments leading up to 1-19 were crucial, I was in a different mental state, and a new place in my heart all together. It was a special time for me, I was ready to commit.

29121,Journal Check-In,"29 days of good, bad and a peek","Hey y'all.

I haven't journaled in a while about my nofap journey, so I figured to write it here.

Today was a good day. I haven't had any serious urge. The only thing I'm battling right now are thoughts. The cute girl at work. The fine boss. I know better than to shit on a good job or thrash my happy home so the real life action never ever gets there. The thought of trying makes me uncomfortable and hot, in a bad way, like a panic attack or something like that. Think that scene in Wanted when McAvoy is sweating to death. That's me if confronted with the possibility of fucking around. It's a fleeting thought that becomes terrifying. Then the more I think on it, I don't want another woman's problems that come with the fun time. I am soundboard and sometimes solver for one wife already. Gotta think these things through.

Thinking. I have a lot of energy to think. I took a peek last night. Went to pornhub. Scanned. Watched. So I guess more than a peek. I got bored and said to myself, this sucks. That vice, the porn, is just a tool to fill some void. When you're up and doing shit I'd be trying to fill a void with senseless stuff and then you fill it with XXX and well... Junk in and you become junk. So I'm closer to not at all being interested in porn or Jerking off. This is good. As you speak out what is bothering you, it becomes real and then you can really do something about it.

Nofap is good. I don't have superpowers except not wasting the man fuel in my loins, energy or seconds on earth that the good Lord gave me. Pray, or meditate, or think really intently and for an extended time, about what your void is. Mine was acceptance and value. Porn was the fantasy outlet. Fantasizing about being accepted by others. The thoughts needed to change. What I do my brain with needed to change.

No matter what you believe, know this... No one has to accept you. You're already awesome. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajkbeb/29_days_of_good_bad_and_a_peek/

29131,Motivation,"If you are struggling really hard, I hope this wall of text helps you.","Some of us struggle very much to not relapse. Then post about it on here like:

""Hey guys, I feel bad that I relapsed again but I'm going to start a new streak! Wish me luck""

Most of the responses:

""Hey don't worry about it, the important thing is that you're being dedicated""
""Good luck man, I also relapsed today but I'll start a new streak with you""
""I'm so proud of you for not giving up! You are making progress still so keep it up""
""Try to set small goals for yourself and build them up over time""
*insert more motivational comments*

Then those same people relpase again not too long after, but maybe their streak was longer than last time which is good progress or maybe the streak was shorter which is still progress but not as much. They seek advice on why they can't keep long streaks and how to stop failing, even with all the support there is here. It's really great how supportive everyone is here though and how it helps a lot of us out.

What I'm trying to get at is that I notice more failures when we set ourselves up for hard mode unprepared. While a lot of us can start out in hard mode and still find success, there will be some that keep on struggling. It sounds better to be on easy mode for a lot longer with more success than to keep failing on hard mode.

Maybe you could have more success with a really long streak if you are only MO free or only P free in the beginning and then be fully PMO free when you feel comfortable. Which do you find to be a worse feeling: a relapse from P or a relapse from MO? If you're on easy mode then you can't relapse as much if the thing you did wasn't considered a relapse to you. If you keep associating your relapses with the word 'failure' then it give relapse a negative connotation which would condition us to feel in an unhealthy way about it. We all have to deal with failure at some point but it's how we deal with it that matters. Being able to learn from our failures should be a healthy experience and part of the journey of NoFap is learning to be able to think more positively and have a better outlook on things.

Imagine you got a new game and it's supposedly really hard with no way to change the difficulty and it's rogue-like. It gets frustrating if you just brute force it and end up starting again over and over. But maybe all you had to do was get a feel for the game first. Take on all the easier tasks first and then add in the extra challenge when you are ready.

It's supposed to be a great journey but every time you take your 10th step you run back to the starting point. Don't be too hasty, take smaller steps, but always keep moving forward. If taking the easy route is what actually gets you to your destination then so be it, at least you're getting there!

All this is just something I been thinking about and wanted to get it out there. I'm just hoping it helps some of you out there that really struggle.

In short, why do we choose to repeatedly fail on a difficult task when that time spent could be used to succeed on an easier task?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajkdg7/if_you_are_struggling_really_hard_i_hope_this/
29152,Emergency - Help!,17 year old guy with depression seeking advice,"I'm a 17 year old guy who has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for over a year and a half. I feel like I want to be in love but I don't love myself. My sex drive is so low to the point that I'm not able to get myself to masturbate for enjoyment. I just feel like I'm doing something wrong and that it's too shameful unless it's with a girl or something; though, I don't think that's not going to happen any time soon. I don't want to lose my virginity to a hooker one day in a hotel room because I'm too depressed to love myself or someone else. I want to have sex for the first time with someone I am married to and that I love.

I don't know if not masturbating at all or for great lengths of time would be healthy for me, considering that I feel like I don't like myself to begin with and the feeling of wanting to masturbate but not doing so feels really bad but I'm not sure. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. I'm much too afraid to talk about this sort of stuff with my parents, my therapist, or my psychiatrist and it's the number one thing that's bothering me. The constant battle of wanting to masturbate and feeling too upset at myself to is affecting my sleep, my mood during the day, my interactions with other people, and ultimately my view of myself.

But I have to ask,  I see posts on here all the time about the benefits, (even without them, I'm done with PMO, it's caused too much damage in my life) yet I have yet to experience them? 

If anything, I've been more scatter brained, more tired, more anxious and it's been so much harder to focus. I don't know what I'm missing. A 7 day streak in April of last year caused me to have the best day in probably all of high school, but I relapsed like an idiot and until December, I didn't begin to make an attempt to stop. Hit my previous best 18 days aforementioned, but I didn't notice many changes. Even now, less so. So I have to ask, does it simply take longer for one to feel normal again? I go to the gym, I eat better than I ever have, my grades are all A's, and yet I feel empty, without emotion, walking around school in a shell scared to talk to anyone but someone I've previously met. It's sickening and I can't even talk to my crush properly. I'm trying to change, no PMO for 24 days, but I don't feel different. Any insight?

29321,Question to NoFap,My first 30 Day Streak + Plus Some Confusions to Clarify,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

So, for the first time in my life (29 yrs old) I've made it past the 30 day mark (Day 36 and counting). After having failed many many times over a couple of years, I've made it someway, somehow. I wanted to take a moment to celebrate and enjoy this achievement. It's been tough for me to get here.

&amp;#x200B;

Having said that, I'm confused by a few things (and I haven't looked into things in the no FAP community for a long time. I feel like my sex drive is non-existent for the past couple of weeks. As I've been traveling, I've been with three new women over the past month as well. With the 1st and 3rd, I had a hard time getting hard. With the 2nd, not so much. I don't feel like my regular self in this regard. I'm traveling for a few months and normally I'd take this chance to talk to as many women as possible, yet I have no interest and drive to do so. I'm assuming this is just a part of the process, but I'm still freaking out a little. (It could also be that maybe I wasn't as attracted to them as I thought). If this is normal, can someone (based off their experiences perhaps) comment on how long it'll take for me to get back out there? haha.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past couple of nights, I should note, that I've experienced more dreams (not sexual) and it seems like I've had a hard-on all night (solid strength to it as well). Wondering if this could be attributed to the rebooting process, or that I'm just catching up on quality sleep that I've been missing lately (recovering from a small motorcycle accident).

&amp;#x200B;

Appreciate any and all thoughts comments and best of luck you everyone out there. It's not easy, but stick with it.

Cheers.

29487,Advice to NoFap,130 days. My secret rules of success,"I have just reached 130 days since my last relapse. Over the course of this streak I have not watched porn, masturbated or had an orgasm. Also, I have not had sex since July 2017.

Long story short, I would like to share with you some of my secret rules of success which could help you overcome this addiction.

1. Learn to exercise deliberate control over your thoughts. Realize that your body is the servant of the mind. You can prevent any thought from transcending into an action. Reason is not automatic. Before a man can achieve anything, even in worldly things, he must lift his thoughts above slavish animal indulgence. The higher he lifts his thoughts, the greater will be his success. Become one with your ideal.

2. Fight instant gratification in all of its forms and manifestations. Understand that anything worthwhile is never instant. Instant things tend to have long-term consequences.

3. Learn to handle stress, anxiety and rejection head-on instead of escaping or numbing it. You can avoid reality, but you cannot avoid the consequences of avoiding reality.

4. Avoid staying alone as much as possible until you reach 90-120 days or until your cravings subside. Idleness is dangerous. The brain will seek mischief.

5. Stop sleepwalking through life. Define your life goals, purpose and devote yourself to them religiously. Life is not a clickable link and success is not a random accident. Don’t fall for the quantum leap. No genuine success in life is instant. What you think, multiplied by action plus time, will create your destiny. You will become as small as your controlling desire or as great as your dominant aspiration.",1900,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajnhip/130_days_my_secret_rules_of_success/

29500,Motivation,I'm 150 days clean today. Advice for you if you want to do the same.,"I'm a big believer of technique over pure will-power. 

Will-power is difficult.

Some days, we get tired or just have a really shit time...

On those days, you are going to want to fap to feel good &amp; because you are tired or are having a bad day, your will-power is going to be absolute trash.

&amp; That's when you relapse.

No matter how strong you think you are, if you don't have the right techniques, your will-power can give away &amp; lead to an undesired relapse. 

These are techniques you can apply to make yourself less susceptible to a relapse by utilising an understanding in behavioural economics. 

1. Snapping out of your fap-zone

We all have a time &amp; a place that we fap. In the afternoon when no one is around or at night right before we sleep, etc. 

Because we used to do it so often, our minds have been tricked to feel cravings for PMO when you are in that time or place.

Become aware of WHEN and WHERE you usally watch porn &amp; fap. I call this the fap-zone. 

Once you recognise this fap-zone. AVOID that situation. 

E.g. Be outside in the afternoon if you do it during that time/put your phone or laptop away before you sleep,etc.

Put yourself in a situation where you can't fap during your usual fap time and don't be at the place where you fap during that time.

Snap out of your fap-zone.

2. Assign negativity to PMO &amp; fap

Most people fail on streak because they often associate PMO and fap with something pleasurable or ""good""

The moment they abstain from it, they enter the mindset that they are staying away from this ""goodness""

This makes it difficult to stay away from PMO because we are naturally rebellious by nature and want to break our own rule to experience this ""goodness"" 

Assign negativity to PMO &amp; FAP. It ain't difficult. 

As much as everyone on the Internet thinks that masturbation is healthy, it's fueled by the porn industry fabricating news by bribing doctors.

Masturbation compulsively &amp; watching porn makes you unable to focus, seek instant gratification, lose drive &amp; motivation for life &amp; overall not great if you want to maximize your potential.

Assign this mindset to PMO &amp; fap. 

Once you are able to do so, you are no longer abstaining from something ""good"", you are staying away from something that is ""bad"" for you. 

Change your perspective &amp; your behaviours will follow automatically.

3. Change your identity.

It used to be ""I'm trying my best to not watch porn or I am staying away from porn"". 

What's wrong with these are that while you believe in the actions, your self-identity remains more or less the same.

What you have to do is to change your self-identity and believe firmly that you are someone who doesn't masturbate. 

Say to yourself ""I don't watch porn &amp; I don't fap""

Believe it firmly and base your identity on that. 

What this does is that it changes your self-perspective and make you believe that you are someone who doesn't indulge in all this.

Instead of quitting these habits, you are changing your inner self-identity.

This is very much more effective. 

Conclusion

This is a long post written in a concise manner. If you have managed to read until here. You have already made a conscious step towards success on nofap.

The gist of these techniques lie not in changing behaviours but in changing your inner core. 

Working from the inside to outside results in longer lasting effective results more so than working outwards to the inside.

Recognise this and begin putting these technique to practice. Bookmark this page and keep returning to it each time you feel like you are losing it.

At the end of the day, it's not the ones who work the hardest that succeed. It's the ones who work the smartest. 

Good Luck &amp; godspeed my friends.

2. The instant gratification, at the end of the date I just wanted to make out before we parted ways and I got a quick peck on the lips.

29527,Success Story,Unintentional 18.5 week Monk Mode completed.,"This is my first ever post to NoFap. Just to let you know.

I wish that this was a guide to help others on completing any sort of challenge with NoFap but I've only found out about this subreddit yesterday and my case is very specific so unfortunately I might not offer any help.

I was in a Psychiatric Unit for 18 weeks but I've also spent half a week in generic hospitals before I got transferred to a Mental Hospital.

Everything in a Mental Hospital was controlled and I didn't have my phone there for 17 weeks (that was just family issues). This meant that there was no porn, nothing that could be suggestive, all the staff had a (semi-strict) dress code and the other inpatients (mainly girls) had a dress code to follow which was that they couldn't allow anything revealing. This was alright as the girls outnumbered the boys here 5 to 1 (I should've mentioned this earlier but the hospital was for 12-18 year olds). Anyway, the girls themselves were alright but most of them had eating disorders but somehow they were still allowed to use social media in their free time (It's a broken system I know.)

Ironically my mood has been on the lowest peak during my entire stay in the hospital (this is ironic because hospitals are meant to help you) so I didn't have courage to even think about porn. There was once a time when on of the female staff members decided to merge small talk and sex talk in her car. She was nice and it was only us two but I panicked since I never expected a sex talk from an Occupational Therapist. I gave an honest answer (at the time) saying that I'm not interested in anything sex related. She forwarded this to other staff and now all of the staff thought that I was Asexual.

Plus, there wasn't much time for a PMO session anyway because the time where you were in your room alone didn't equal a full hour so it was problematic to even consider anything PMO related.

Sorry for the long story but a lot of people get the wrong idea about mental hospitals so I decided to give a little context.

TL;DR: If you're looking to complete Monk Mode go to a Psychiatric Unit because most of the girls there looked like skeletons anyway.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajo9f0/unintentional_185_week_monk_mode_completed/

SOFTWARE: I use the Ever Accountable internet tracking software and because i am very open with my wife about my addiction i made her my accountability partner so she gets weekly report of my activity on every device i have. 

PROBLEM: Problem is, i still find ways either around the software or blatantly disregard the monitoring and just wait for the guilt to hit me the night before the report comes out and give the same shitty excuses ive had for almost two years. 

QUESTION: Does anyone else use accountability software of somekind, and if so how is it working for you? Do you find it helpful, or does it just encourage you to be sneaky?

&amp;#x200B;

And this reminded me that a few years ago, when I was approximately at 90 days of no masturbation, porn or whatever, I discovered meditation. And the feeling when I meditated was just extraordinary. The thing is, I relapsed once just before I discovered meditation, but no big deal I guess.

But the other thing is that meditation gave me several sleep paralysis, so I just stopped meditation from that point (I meditated during about 2 weeks, it was awesome by the way, the best and most intense two weeks of my life I think).

I also started again masturbating, and that good feeling during the meditation slowly but surely disappeared.

&amp;#x200B;

One or two years later, I wanted to experiment again that crazy feeling of inner peace during meditation, but I didn't manage to.

&amp;#x200B;

29656,Question to NoFap,Ethical questioning: Should lucid-dream orgasm count as a relapse?,"Long story short, last night I fell into a state of sleep similar to that of a lucid dream. I know this state from before, it's a state in which you are conscious yet into a dream or halfway to completely fall asleep, and somehow your body and mind are extremely sensitive to sexual thoughts. You could think of something sexual for about 5 seconds and ejaculate already. Not even joking. And you don't even get to see strong, dream-like images. Just your average flaky, transparent-like mental image. Like trying to imagine something with your eyes closed while being completely conscious, but with the features I described before (extreme sensitivity to sexual arousal by sexual thoughts)

So, I casually got into this state last night, and used it to fantasize about my favorite hentai character (Shamsiel Shahar by the way, hehe), and had an orgasm in 5 seconds or so. Later on I check my underwear when I wake up, and indeed it has semen on it.

Should this count as ""mental PMO,"" and therefore a relapse?

29659,Victory,Day 90,"Good day, Fapstronauts

Today I am celebrating my 90th day since I last watched porn or masturbated. I feel great and my next goal is to try for 365+, and I feel like I can actually achieve this, something I did not think possible for a long time. 

Here are some tips I have for those of you struggling to make it:

* You can't just say you're not gonna watch porn. You have to devote yourself to self improvement. If everything you do stays the same but you just decide to not watch porn, you will watch it. Pick up good hobbies like reading, exercising, start eating healthy. Really go all in on improving yourself. Then you are no longer just quitting porn, but becoming an all around better version of you, and quitting becomes another (albeit very important) aspect of this.
* Learn from your past failures. For example, I noticed that I was extremely prone to watching porn if I watched netflix in bed. So I stopped watching netflix in bed and started reading before bed. This was more difficult than I thought but worked tremendously. It also had several added benefits of improving my sleep and, crucially, encouraged me that all those relapses actually taught me something and that I truly was making progress.
* Slow down. If you are on the internet and catch a glimpse of a triggering image or a tempting thought enters your head, just slow down for a sec. If you are like I was 90 days ago, these pictures/thoughts will cause a whole lot of excitement in your brain, your heart rate might go up, etc. What I would do is stop and say, ""Yes, that image has excited me, but it does not control me. It is just a picture, and I am strong enough to move on and keep progressing."" Take some deep breaths, then push it out of your mind.But of course, avoid triggering material when possible.
* To state the overstated: take it one day at a time. Every single day of these 90 I have woke up and thought, ""Alright, 90 days is my current goal, but more important than that is going to sleep tonight having not watched porn. I just need to survive today."" 
* Watching Ted Talks and reading resources about how porn is bad for you really helped me a lot. I really recommend you check out [https://fightthenewdrug.org/](https://fightthenewdrug.org/)
* Finally, find what works for you. There is a lot of great advice on here but ultimately you need to find what truly works for you, and that will be a little bit different for everyone. This is difficult, but you can do it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not an all inclusive list but I really hope you can take something away from it. If I can do it, you can too. It really is a change of mindset and I feel much different now than I did 90 days ago. I am back in control of my life. So good luck to all of you. Stay strong.

**What's it about?**

It comes from the Sikh tradition \[correction: Hindu... see comments!\]

You wear it on your dominant wrist, and whenever you make an action with your hands it shows up visibly to remind you.

Its purpose is twofold:

1. A constant reminder of your connection to a higher power.
2. A reminder to only use your hands to do good work.

Mine is stainless steel, so won't cause skin problems and can stay on through bathing/showering etc. (Some are chrome/iron... I didn't think that was a great idea)

In circumstances where it can't be loose (electrical work, extreme sports etc.) there are a couple of options... firstly move it higher up the arm where it is snug then... wear a bandage or sock with the toe cut out over it, or alternatively tape over it.

Checked out the airport situation and as an object of faith they will, apparently, be happy to do a pat down and wand if you set of the metal detector. And Sikhs (who wear a kara as part of their faith) are happy for everybody to show their devotion and commitment in this way - it is not offensive to them.

I can imagine severe examples where it would need to be removed (it would have to come off for an MRI scan), but I'm sure emergency services have cutting equipment for rings etc. in case of emergency.

**Conclusion**

It's a big win in my opinion. Almost certainly not for everyone, but I thought I'd throw it out there in case it helps.",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajr69v/a_permanent_reminder/

29714,New to NoFap,The Weekend is Approaching,"The Weekend is Approaching and I am very, very scared of relapsing as it usually is the weekend which causes me to fail a streak even my longest ones that have been usually for 10+ days however that does not mean I had the cleanest of streaks during my time before I am just saying I noticed I was way more confident and outgoing back during my streak than I have now been for a week or two and considering I've been having constant relapses after failures in my vocational and high school so I decided I need help and came here as I want to change my bad habits one-by-one.

I feel a bit of background to my PMO addiction is necessary so let me tell you, my story. I am 17 years old and this year I will be 18 however I have been suffering from this addiction for 5-6 years now however when I first PMO'd back when I was 11 years old I thought that was that and did not indulge in it further but now knowing what it was it would come into play more heavily in my life after I moved to another town leaving my home town (I'll call it ""Hell"" for the sake of privacy) in the hopes of finally gaining a potential ""father figure"" my mom had dated for a while but lets just say everything went wrong for me and my mother; my mom got abused by this ""father figure"" and I often found myself to be the only one who knew that until finally, my mom had a divorce with him when I was 15 years old however during that time I was bullied for 1-3 years which was enough to throw me away from most people in school and become a social outcast among my peers for another 2 years. Within this 5 years a true addiction to PMO developed, in fact, I remember days where I used to do it 7 to 9 times a day but I did not see it as a problem as I preferred to see the world as the problem rather than myself.

Everything changed however when I moved back to my hometown as I watched a show called ""Houseki No Kuni"" or ""Land of the Lustrous"" at the age of 16 which inspired me to change who I am (through a very relatable story) and can be largely thanked for the recent fondness I have had for self-help books such as; ""The 48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene and ""12 Rules for Life"" by Jordan Peterson and have not stopped since as I have bookcase waiting to be read in my room however when I thought life started to look brighter... Let's just say High School happened where I met someone who I genuinely pitied as my ego had been boosted from the recent progress I've been having in my life but this pity proved to be my downfall as at the end of this semester I realized that he had better grades than me in nearly everything and thus it returned; the feelings of resentment and envy I thought I had lost after leaving that ""Hell"" returned almost as if washing over me and pushing  me back down to square one as I started relapsing attempt after another(3 attempts with varying success)...

I want to end this by saying I know I have other problems than just my PMO addiction, for example, an ego which is really easy to stir however I want to change that and experience a new me and to do that I know I have to first start small so when I said at the beginning ""one-by-one"" that means I really meant it and NoFap will only be a small part of the things I want to change. My aspirations are to be a writer and expand from there to storytelling in video games however I fear I can't reach that unless I start changing here and now and just hope I am not too late.

29721,Article,[HARDMODE] I was so deep in PMO there was no sudden way out,"Have you ever tried hardmode reset and failed?

Much is said in NoFap about ""hardmode reset"" and how that's the only way out. I want to bring up a different hypothesis: we're repeating a pattern here, the idea that if you relapse once, you'll relapse forever; if you give up in a moment of weakness, means you *are* weak by default. Let's try to see resetting and recovery in a more contextualized, learning-curve-like perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I've been sexually traumatized by age 7, found porn while trying to understand sex on the internet, and got radically addicted to PMO soon after - now I'm 23, trying my second 90-day journey. Lost a promotion that would've doubled my salary, lost a bachelors degree in Computer Science once (currently trying the second time), and lost a technical degree in Mechanical Engineering. I had depression for a few years, during which time I'd have over 10 orgasms a day on certain occasions just to get away from reality.

&amp;#x200B;

After trying hardmode rebooting every time (and being successful just once, about a year ago), I realized I'm in too deep to have a sudden, sharp recovery. That recognition was the key to creating a viable, working chain of concepts and practices to allow me to advance and break the cycle of failure, and was a radical rupture in my approach to the problem because it took into consideration the real factors in the paragraph above. No one, not a single person deals with as much trouble in a single blow without just forgetting or putting something under the carpet, and somethings you can't just hide from yourself. Similarly, maybe you've got other sorts of pressuring factors: a loving wife you can't have sex with due to PIED, lack of focus in important work stuff due to PMO addiction, can't count on your own family or friends to expose the problem and seek comfort, or can't afford an actually helpful psychological treatment.

In other words... the chemical processes in our brains is very real, objective, concrete. There's certain wrong chemistry there due to porn, and we need to change it to get over PMO addiction. That's it. But the way we see our own personal ways to recover is *not* so objective, and is subject to the world view we have: mostly the pressure to be successful, to handle everything at the same time, not delay a single deadline at work and/or school, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*We can't afford to fail - that's what the world teaches us every time. People who have a lot to lose may get to a point at which we dread a relapse almost the same way we'd dread a suicide. It's another day you are older, your brain is less plastic and less likely to recover, another lost deadline, another job, another lover. That's... exhausting.*

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe take a step back. We certainly need to be firm about things and commit to our own change, but does that commitment have to apply to every front of this war at the same time? The answer is a resounding NO. The best strategy to win this war is tackling fronts we can win, one at a time, not trying all fronts ""because that's the way it is"" and failing on all of them at the same time. If you fail, the only reason is because you tried changing something that's too big for you to try. Be strong, firm, committed to one thing at a time. In practice, here's what I suggest to end PMO addiction, one letter at a time:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Strangle porn and porn idealization.** Use every parental control you can find. Install a DNS Changer on your phone and direct it to OpenDNS's family shield. It's easy, just an app you install. The addresses are [208.67.222.123](https://208.67.222.123) and [208.67.220.123](https://208.67.220.123). Spend money on this if you need to, $10 on an app is worth less than your own mental wellbeing. Curb Chrome/Safari and get Firefox - it allows you to use add-ons, including FoxFilter, which is a great app that allows you to add blocked words on the go. Relapsed? Fine, block that search term you just used to find porn; you won't relapse that way next time. Eventually you'll run out of search terms and have a consistent, personalized blocked list that will keep you away from porn long enough to give up masturbating. Took me 1 or 2 weeks to reach that stage, adding terms daily. The takeaway is simple: if you've done a lot to shut down porn from at least your phone, it's worth staying away from it. If you haven't even blocked these websites/resources, which is a relatively simple process, then it feels like you've already given up. Why would you do any more effort to avoid it? *Brain-wise, it is a huge step forward to getting away from visual stimulation the way you are used to it.*
2. **Mediate masturbation.** Yes, yes, a thousand times yes: masturbation without porn IS very different from masturbation with porn. If you've strangled porn for long enough (1st step), you'll also be stronger and more respectful to yourself to not think about porn scenes while you masturbate. Now, if you haven't gone through the first step, masturbation+idealization will drag you back to it. *Chemically, at this stage you are redefining sexual stimulation. Maybe without visuals you'll feel touch more. Even if that's your own touch, now the stimulus is not coming visually (or imagined) from overstimulating porn.*
3. **Redefine orgasm.** You'll certainly live much better without porn, possibly live without masturbation whatsoever but certainly not live well without orgasm. You want to find pleasure in someone else's touch someday. You want to be able to give them pleasure sexually. You shouldn't fight orgasms, but redefine them. At this point, if you've done the first steps correctly, you'll have considerably diminished your masturbation frequency because porn and porn idealization are no longer overstimulating you for some time now. *That helps restore sensitization to real sex, and longing for real touch from someone else. You'll be more likely to reconnect orgasm to real sex when you're finally free from visual over stimulation then if you try it* while *you are still struggling.*

&amp;#x200B;

Along that process, you should

* Allow yourself to fail. No process is perfect - for example, I've uninstalled every parental protection from my phone, more than once, just to get porn. But what matters is that I installed them again. I showed myself that I care, that I did not give up. Nowadays I take those protections seriously and do not ever consider uninstalling, even during an urge to PMO. I'm stronger because I know I'll go back and raise the bar again if I have to.
* Reward yourself more. Get some real, quality entertainment, go walk on the park with some friends, nice delicious food, drink more water, get your body ready for the battle. Taking PMO away is a huge blow to the reward system, so you should reeducate yourself by getting some real rewards.
* Finally, raise the stakes. Now that you have divided your efforts and made commitment to a change you can actually accomplish, that's the time to be relentless. I'll give you an example: because I could not reach porn in any way on a browser (yay, huge progress!), I was finding porn on chat app groups. So I had to create an app to intercept chat links to porn groups on messaging apps. What do YOU need to do to show yourself some self-made progress.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, maybe you're not in so deep, didn't go through some of the trauma or have not been addicted for so long as me or other people. Maybe you have a more supportive family, education and conditions to thrive in this society, or if you feel so strong you don't get massacred by the pressure. If you can recover from PMO addiction in a single blow and leave that behind TODAY, than that's great, you're above this live of the curve.

For those of us who are not in that position, and have more problems to deal with - extensive work hours, difficult family and/or relationships, more pressure from school, trauma; or for those to whom every help hasn't helped enough. Maybe it's time to try not to solve all problems at once. Hardmode recoveries are great, but they may not really be an exemplary case. Instead, they might as well be the PMO-recovery version of the unreachable successfulness we see on Instagram.

&amp;#x200B;

The bottom-line is that you, me - and everyone - can recover from this. The definition of ""the right way to do it"" is the way you can actually accomplish progress and show yourself that you care, that giving up is not an option, even if it is one small decision at a time. Even if it takes deconstructing an entire system of psychological pressure for success and immediatism that blames us for our personal failure to deal with collective problems that affect billions, just to give ourselves the time to breathe and make the right decisions after we relapse next time.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajri92/hardmode_i_was_so_deep_in_pmo_there_was_no_sudden/
29748,New to NoFap,"15 Days, no PMO","15 days today at 10pm. I started on the no PMO idea almost as a whim, but on further consideration I realized I had a pretty serious problem. 

I'm a 54 year-old guy, recently divorced. As a healthy guy, I was having ED problems that came out of nowhere (I thought), and I pretty much couldn't climax without porn. Worse, I had some constant low-level guilt about my habit.

The 15 days haven't been easy. The middle of the night is hardest (literally). I wake up at 3am every night with wood, and in that groggy state it's been all I could do to resist. Quite often, looking at this forum has helped me in those moments. 

Other than that, I'm finding cold showers helpful, as well as exercise and putting my house into order. My immediate goal is 90 days PMO free; after that, I want to be a guy who doesn't PMO. I feel like I can do this. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajrw41/15_days_no_pmo/

29934,Motivation,Day 11 - Not the words but the actions! Motivational journal check-in,"I have very mixed feelings about the past day. I had many great things happen to me today, and I did a lot stuff I'm proud of. But I feel like I have betrayed myself today.

In yesterday's post I talked about how I found myself at least somewhat respecting women. Today I didn't do that as much. I didn't relapse though, nor did I do anything worth a reset. But I did end up noticing that same old mindset about women in my heart. It all started by getting bored while in public. Yesterday I noted that the process of respecting women has just started for me, so this isn't the reason why I feel like I betrayed myself.

During the morning and day I pretty much kept on doing my responsibilities and being active, but at this very moment I feel lousy. I feel lousy because I just sat on the couch watching youtube videos for hours straight. Basically I relapsed in my youtube addiction. Or at the very least I gave in to the temptation of watching youtube videos instead of doing uni work I planned on doing. I feel like I just wasted a huge chunk of my time. What does a bit of entertainment do to you? It makes you passive. Especially if you watch the entertainment alone. It makes you feel useless. And I'd bet this goes for every type of entertainment: TV, Netflix, Youtube, Video games, PMO, etc...

I feel like I betrayed myself because I had even said out loud (to a family member) that I was planning on doing uni stuff. I feel like the lazy bum I (think I) have been for most of my life, sitting at a computer, just trying to entertain myself, instead of doing something actually useful, something that takes some workload off the future days. I wasted that time. Time that I'll never get back. And I feel I lied to myself: ""just this one video and then I'll do the uni stuff"" NO I WON'T!!! Literally 2 or 3 hours wasted on some stupid videos. I know those are rookie numbers, but after the past few days of not watching youtube basically at all, I feel like shit after this youtube session. I feel tired, even exhausted. I feel lazy. I feel shitty.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't be like me. If you have something you should be doing, just do it. Don't say out loud you'll do it. Don't tell anyone you'll be doing it in the future, even if it's in just 5 mins, just do it. Do the homework, write the essay, work on the master's thesis, do your job assignments, pet your cat, feed your cat, call your mother, message that friend you haven't seen in a long time, change the light bulb that's been broken for months, go out for a walk, exercise, stop eating sweets, BE THE FREAKING MAN YOU HAVE WANTED TO BE FOR SO LONG, WHO DOESN'T GIVE UP ON THE FIRST FREAKING SETBACK, WHO FIGHTS BACK WHEN HIS OWN TEMPTATIONS TRY TO SEDUCE HIM, WHO DOESN'T JUST SIT STARING AT A FREAKING SCREEN WATCHING STUFF THAT OTHERS HAVE MADE.

Masturbation has no value, remind yourself of that empty, regretful feeling afterward. That's masturbation. There is no beautiful woman, get over it.

That space in your mind where you put these women on a pedestal should really be used for your own self worth.

MGTOW is misunderstood, as it means different things depending on the man, but MGTOW to me is a helpful replacement for porn, as you remind yourself of your worth as a man and that women aren't a part of that.

&amp;#x200B;

MGTOW means: Female Acceptance ≠ Self Worth.

29984,New to NoFap,17 year old checking in at the start line aiming for the gold,"Hey everyone I'm new to this and I cannot wait to improve myself. I have heard of the amazing things that can be done solely by building up testosterone levels and refraining from the constant lures of masturbation and the devastating/disgusting porn industry.

I am a very scrawny guy and have almost no upper body strength, it's embarrassing to say however, most girls my age would be far stronger than me. I'm hoping that continual/repetitive daily exercise can push me to physical limits and I can much stronger than I am now and feel like a true man.

Recently in my life I have felt completely empty, worn out and tired. I used to masturbate almost every other day as an ordinary occurrence. I believed it was healthy for me 'not to clog anything up.' I have been single all my life and rather pathetically when I was given the slight chance of even befriending a girl I found highly attractive I blew it. My first chance ruined. I have never been kissed or paid much attention to whatsoever and I'm absolutely fed up with it

In other words, my failure inspired me to go for this and to become the best man I can be, a hard working, strong guy that can support himself without feeling terrible all the time.

My main goal from this would be ultimately to find a beautiful, Caring and supportive girl that I can spend my entire life with, hopefully raise children and live the best possible life a man can potentially attain. 

Here I present my list as a public oath...

1. excerise daily. 50 sit ups, 50 star jumps and at least 5 press ups
2. Do not relapse - flex your arms, exercise, game or read to get over the urge
3. Try to be devoted to and good to nature, visit it often. try every weekend once. 
4. spend more time with family in general
5. Try to be out in the cold more often and have cold showers, (start warm then progress to cold?)
6. spend less time on tech like computer or phone
7. develop a broader musical taste
8. always be devoted to your passion of creative writing
9. Clean/groom yourself more often look like the man you want to be
10. Get motivated, be a bastion of sheer willpower become a green lantern

Some media perpetuates that it's okay to not control what you're eating, and skip exercise. Ex: jokes about ""Skipping leg day"", as well as ""fat acceptance""



And it's just like how society made fapping ""okay"" and ""normal behavior"".


I'm not gonna pretend that I'm perfect; I relapsed a lot, and I don't exercise much, but I'm just taking note of these things.

30176,Telling my Story,Why I (and maybe you) have been failing NoFap,"I’ve been trying to go NoFap for a while now but as you can see from my flair, it hasn’t been working out. However, this time it’s different because I realized why I have been failing. 

The reason: my goal 

Goals are extremely important in anything you do. My goal at first was to do NoFap
so that I can impress girls with my newly unlocked “superpowers”(i know it’s a horrible and cringey goal). 

However, after getting a harsh truth about what girls do (even the seemingly innocent ones) today I realized that I was going through Red Pill and NoFap all wrong. 

YOU should be the goal. If you’re not doing this for you than you will fail 100% of the time. Support from friends and family is okay but when you base your motivation and reliance all on other people you won’t take it as serious. 

So now I’m going in with a different mindset(which will also help you). I’m doing this for MYSELF, because I want to see how far I can go, because I want to be the best I can be, because I want to be able to respect myself. Good luck to all you people in your journey, mainly the ones in their teens such as myself.

Summary: your mindset when going in to NoFap should be that you’re doing this for YOURSELF. Keep in mind, it’s alright to have support from friends and family but you shouldn’t rely on them as your sole motivator. You should be doing this for yourself.",41,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajwrhs/why_i_and_maybe_you_have_been_failing_nofap/

In the past **22 YEARS** this is at most the second time I ever went that long without [PMO](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PMO).

It's incredible how much I have changed in such a short period of time:

* I used to sneak in and out of work, not talking to anyone. Now I regularly talk to many other employees and participate in social functions.
* I used to waste a shit ton of time on social media and porn. Now, I barely engage on social media, and I picked up a new hobby and started taking regular classes to get better at it.
* I used to be a total loner. Now I've made amends with a friend I felt out with 7 years ago and made several acquaintances at the classes for my new hobby.
* I used to go to work, then go back home, and sit at home until I have to go to work again. Now, I had to resize my calendar widget on my phone to see better all the shit I'm going out to: the classes, the interest meetups at local events; I'm really eager to meet new people.
* I used to have a ton of acne. Now, I've not seen one in weeks.
* I used to feel depressed and hated waking up. Now, I'm happy and ready to face even challenging days.

NoFap totally works! It makes you develop self-control and frees you a ton of time you don't waste being depressed and browsing the Internet for self-abuse.

I could use some encouragement. Particularly , I have two concerns I'd like help with from anyone who has relapsed after a significant time like this. 

1) I am afraid of losing all progress in the areas of: Having less temptation, dealing with it better, confidence, mental/physical/spiritual strength, ability to feel emotions, ability to connect with others including women... Will those things go back to day 0? Or is it more like I'll have a few days of chaser and then feel like my 8-months sober self again -- but needing to be diligent to not let it become a big backslide, but keep it to one relapse? 

2) My relapse definitely felt like an addictive urge not just a stumble for fun or curiosity. I am from the internet generation and started fapping when I was like 12 to porn. Obviously, this seems to mean my mind and brain weren't  fully ""healed"" yet after 8 months (even though I thought they were cuz I'd had little to no temptation for months!)... Sooo, can I ever expect the addiction to abate entirely? ... I know it's different for everyone but my goodness if I can still feel like an impulsive drug addict with porn after 8 months of sobriety that's pretty extreme don't you think?

30420,Motivation,MGTOW &amp; NoFap,"# Why must there be a feud between these two?

There has always been an issue between these two different ideologies however they have many similarities, one of them is that both mainly involve men. What I want to do is share my opinion on NoFap and MGTOW for I do believe both of them are great however the members do have their pros and cons.

# NoFap

Nofap, of course, is great and I appreciate all of you guys for the advice and it's really nice to see the growth and improvement of young men from ages 11- 40(even younger and older than that). It shows that no matter what your age is, everyone has a problem with PMO at some point in their life. Now the problem I do see is that a lot of men, especially around my age, is that teenagers seem to have this idea that women are pure and that they are the best things in the world. Some even think that women don't watch porn or masturbate, they also feel so sad for the women in porn videos. I hate to say it but some of these men become soft towards women, they become ""white knights"" of you know what I mean.

In 2019, women know what they are doing on Instagram and these porn sites. They are making money and ""believe"" that they are just having fun but the reality is, deep down they know they are wasting their body. They're slapping on tons of make-up, getting these injections and surgeries, and all of this unnecessary stuff. 

I understand a lot of women do this because of their insecurity and society's standards of beauty. My own significant other feels a bit down about her body and I myself feel down to about myself. I advise all of you, both men and women to just love yourself and be grateful for what is working. So what you have a big nose...at least you can breathe through it right? As long as you keep yourself clean, eat right, and exercise...you are fine.

# MGTOW

Now for Men Going Their Own Way I can understand where a lot of them are coming from. I consider myself a bit of a MGTOW too because the main definition of a MGTOW is a man that doesn't follow society's standards such as going to college, getting married, having kids, and then repeat. Another thing, and many MGTOW say this, they ""don't want to be controlled by women"". I believe that no one should control a person, a person should have the right to be free and explore...just as long as they aren't hurting other people.

The problem with MGTOW is that while it claims to forget about women and create self-improvement...they still talk about women 24/7. A lot of them are filled with so much hatred towards women it's quite immature and they seem to use ""alpha"" and ""beta"" terms to describe men...which NoFap members do too but jeez it is cringy as heck.

Then they generalize all women like ""all women are whores"". I am definitely not a feminist but it just makes me think that feminists and MGTOW are like the battle of the sexes where one is a movement and the other is an ideology. 

In my honest opinion, a majority of MGTOW are men that are incels, men that have been cheated on, men that have been hurt by women. I was one of them but there is no need to be all hateful towards women and treat them as if they are weak.

What's mainly strange about MGTOW is this **They want freedom from female control yet they still watch porn and are controlled by women in the videos**. They may not pay for a date anymore but they still pay for a fleshlight, porn subscriptions, and sex dolls. I'm not saying all MGTOW do this but if you are going to do all this preaching about being free of female control...then why are you letting them control your sexual desires? 

&amp;#x200B;

# Equality is key

My stance on doing both NoFap and MGTOW is this: Treat women with just as much respect as you would for a man. Don't treat a woman like she's a Princess/Queen unless she is your Girlfriend/Wife because then you are her Prince/King. You should let the lady go in the building first not because she is a lady but rather you just felt like being thoughtful of another human being.

The reason you do NoFap shouldn't only be that you want a girlfriend to have sex with. It should be to gain self-discipline...to better yourself as a man. Whether you are MGTOW or not, you only have one life...do what you want. College is not for everyone, some people prefer trade school or the military. Who says you have to be married and have kids? What makes a ""Real Man""?

Don't let the mainstream media control you. Do what you want to in life...you only have one life so work hard, find your purpose, make a good contribution to the world like help finding a cure or volunteer and help out at some shelter. do good in this world...good will surely come back to you.

30429,Other,Huh so I just found I was cheated on.,"I broke up with my first girlfriend after I saw she was in another relationship. I wanted to tear the throat out of a bear and probably would have if I didn't go for a run moments after. So I remained composed. She's no longer my girlfriend.

I think I'm done with dating for a while. I don't know. I want a relationship because I'm built for one. I'm seeking to change my life in many ways. I'm even talking with someone about mentoring me in Marketing. I'll be successful and healthy one day. But I don't want to be alone. I can be, but I want to love someone and be loved back. Have a chance at being the best man I can be first someone else.

But my first girlfriend cheated on me. I guess my desire for virtue and understanding made her disinterested. when you have skin in the game shit happens I know and honestly I understand why she did it. She's a trauma survivor and responded to our great chemistry by running. I just don't know where to go from here. I've tried for years, dating. But there's never a connection. Now that I've found a great connection Im cheated on. I don't know.

So this Monday I was at school, and I was trying to ski on ice. I slipped on ice and I cracked my head. Now I have a huge hole that is stiched. Fuck man, I relapsed again this week just because I was bored. With this bandaid on my head, I can't do many things. I am not allowed to stay much at my PC, I can't go out and yeah. Let me tephrase, I relapsed everyday. 

This got me thinking, this life is to short to just watch porn and then to masturbate. Shit! You can die at any moment, just like that. 

Lest do this for ourselves. We can do this! Even if your relapse, don't give up. If you fap everyday for a year you fap 365 times. But even if you have 1 day streakes for a year, it means you only masturbate 182 days. So keep on going and stay strong!",41,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ajz0h1/realized_how_short_life_is/

30495,Journal Check-In,50 Days Update,"This is my second  time doing this. I've reached 50 days as of yesterday. Looking forward to a wonderful year.

Things I observed

1) Depression is gone. I can't explain this but I'm happy. Every morning I wake up and look forward to having a great day.

2) I have this clarity on what I should do. I'm getting stuff done, things which I've procrastinated for a really long time. I was blind but now I see.

3) Confidence in everything that I do. I walk into a room and I own it. When I start speaking in a group, people stop what they are doing and they listen to me. 

4) Will power, I came across some P accidentally when I opened reddit yesterday. But I had this self-control, it was like I am becoming close to my ideal self, instead of scrolling, I closed it. I was actually impressed with myself. So, I decided to test this, I intentionally opened some P. That is when it happened, a voice in the back of my head said, this is wrong, this is not what happens in real life. I'm in control baby, I don't give in to momentary pleasure.

5) And yes the powers of attraction are real, I noticed some girls when they were checking me out. I even got good matches on tinder.

Tips:

1) At around day 35, I had strong urges. I doubled my gym time and did pushups whenever I got an urge.

2) Make sure that you are not idle. Especially the weekends, now I meetup with friends regularly and I have a good social life

1. Not touch phone half hour before sleep. 
2. Do daily exercise of arm, chest, and leg such that the total duration of exercise will be at least 1 hour. 
3. Try to focus more and increase concentration while studying and playing sports. 
4. Talk to my inner conscience, again and again, to tell myself what I am doing in present and how it is going to help me in the future.

Means it just like case of smoking , we say smokers crave for NicotinE But science says Nicotine gets flushed out from body from within few days . Then why do people smoke again and again . I think due to less research in field of PMO &amp; misunderstanding of people dopaMine had blamed. People don't understand  their habits properly . This also reason why many successful fapstronauts who leave no fap get trickle back to their old habits of fapping . People are no Longer bother about their habit loops.

30603,Success Story,This shit really works!!,"I’ve been a lurker on this sub since the end of last year. Decided to make a post 

I’ve started nofap around the start of November. I did this because I realised how bad everything had gotten for me. I was addicted to watching porn. I’d gone from a couple times a week to multiple times a day. 

I started caring less and less about my own dignity and would fap whenever I had 2 minutes.  

One day I realised that it couldn’t be good for me and I stumbled across this sub after spending ages looking for an answer. 

I gave it a go, and cannot belive the results. I’m blown away by how beneficial it’s been for me. 

Suddenly my acne has cleared up and I appear far more attractive than previously. I’ve reduced my bad habits such as excessive gaming or unhealthy eating completely subconsciously.  

Then just recently, I found a group of people around my age hanging out. Some really pretty girls and other guys playing basketball. I just went up and joined their game. The girls commended me on my bravery for making new friends all of a sudden. But even better I commended myself for it. 

I completely surprised myself when I did this and loved it. My confidence has been boosted tenfold and I’m still grinning. 

Nofap works and I’m going to keep on trying. My best streak is 12 days and I’m aiming for 90. But I’m taking it day by day, hour by our. And gradually I’ll succeed and reboot myself.

No, no fap is not going to change your life from one day to another, it's not going to give you super powers and it's not going to make you become a women magnet.

That's a loser mindset. If you really want all those super powers you have to work them out and yes, nofap can definitely help, but if you're not willing to put effort into other things then just give up with nofap too, because you're just wasting your time.

I wish this sub were a realistic and healthy place, but if most of you believe in magic formulas and gurus, then this is not the place for me.

30619,Motivation,Nietzsche was a genuine badass,"&gt;Look at this languishing one! He is but an inch from his goal, yet from weariness he has laid himself down obstinately in the dust: this brave one! He yawns from weariness at the path and the earth and the goal and himself: he will not go a step further. Now the sun glows on him and dogs lick his sweat: but he lies there in his obstinacy and prefers to languish: – to languish an inch from his goal! Truly, you will have to drag him into this heaven by the hair of his head – this hero.  
&gt;  
&gt;Better still that you let him lie where he has lain down, that sleep may come to him, the comforter, with cooling murmuring rain. Let him lie until he wakes of his own accord – until of his own accord he renounces all weariness. Only, my brothers, drive the dogs away from him, the idle skulkers and all the swarming vermin – all the swarming vermin of the ‘cultured’ who – feast on the sweat of every hero!

30646,Relapse Report,Thoughts after 30-day streak relapse,"After a first attempt, I managed 30 days until I relapsed last night after going out drinking. I thought I would share my thoughts on the last month and how I could improve starting back at day 0.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Last night was the first time I had been drunk since starting noFap and it looks like it was enough to make me break. Looking into this next streak I plan on avoiding alcohol altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Abstaining from porn has made me realise this problem runs much deeper than just porn. The instant gratification porn gives seems to be everywhere in my life when I start to look for it whether it's surfing Reddit or scrolling social media or biting my nails! At least now I am more aware of how easily I use social media to try to get the same dopamine hit that masturbation gave me.  I have added a site blocker to chrome so that I can't go onto sites like Facebook and Instagram which seems to be helping but the next challenge seems to be building my ability to maintain focus on a single task for longer periods of time. (any suggestions for building focus?)

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am proud of the habits I have been building since starting noFap. I have been going to the gym regularly, I'm just about to complete the first 30 days of headspace which I'm really enjoying and I am reading before bed every night. I'm hoping to maintain these habits as I start again as I think they both have massive benefits for confidence, anxiety and sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Near the end of my 30-day streak, I started to become much more interested in girls again. It felt as if before when I was horny I would go masturbate but now since I wasn't doing that anymore I felt a need to talk to girls for the first time in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

\- One thing I am still unsure about is how my urges will change. during the last 30 days, I felt huge urges to masturbate which were getting stronger more recently and I am wondering if these will die down over time and how I can get rid of them?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Finally, I have just finished an intensive coding course and I am starting a new job on Monday. I really enjoyed the course and there was something about learning to code which is really satisfying. It's hard to explain but completing lots of small challenges and finally getting my code to run seemed to give me a rush good feelings! I don't quite know how this is related to noFap yet but I feel as if learning a new skill as somehow giving me a similar dopamine rush as masturbation used to give.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking forward to starting again making it to 90+ days this time! I'm hoping by just not watching nearly as much porn in the last month as I used too this time it might be easier but I also now know it only takes one slip up and your back at day 0! wish me luck!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ak0rsk/thoughts_after_30day_streak_relapse/

30662,Victory,I'm on my longest streak since my porn addiction begun at 10 years old.,"One day. One day is the farthest I've ever gotten on NoFap whenever I've attempted it. Various attempts, methods, and motivations, but in the three years I've been trying NoFap, I've never gotten beyond one day.

Until this week. Today in a couple hours I will have hit a 3 day streak! At some points in this journey I never thought I could make it beyond one day. I used to PMO 4-7 times a day (2-3 times in the morning, 2-3 times at night and occasionally once in the afternoon before work too.)

Porn has been my crutch for so long, it's motivating to be able to see that yes, I can survive without porn. My body isn't going to implode from stress because I didn't ejaculate 5 times for 3 days straight. 

The ironic thing is how I was able to achieve the streak. I always thought I'd have to do NoFap to get a girlfriend, but now I have a girlfriend so I'm doing NoFap for her. The day we started dating I did a lot of thinking about how I wanted this relationship to be, and realized that I can't be devoted sexually to porn and my girlfriend. I need to either devote myself to my girlfriend, or devote myself to pixels on a screen.

The choice was easy enough. I told my gf that I struggle with porn addiction but I'm gonna quit for her, and guess what? She struggles with it too! Now we're each others accountability partners in our NoFap journey. :)

It took a real woman to get me to stop looking at porn, but now that I have real evidence of my capability to stop, I think that even if this relationship ended I'd still be able to get myself to stop doing PMO.

I hope you all find what you need to find in order to quit, and that you never give up. You'll make progress eventually, I swear. It took me three years to get more than a 1 day streak.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ak0zdx/im_on_my_longest_streak_since_my_porn_addiction/

30675,Telling my Story,NoFap might not be for everyone.,"Hey everyone. 

I just ended my NoFap streak after 22 days. I didn’t see really any of the benefits that get talked around here. For example, I’ve been going to the gym quite regularly for the past 18 months or so I have seen an uptick in the intensity of my workouts— but I think that has more to do with mine and my gym buddy’s New Years motivation rather than no pmo. As we’ve kept the same intensity since I quit NoFap.

NoFap made me angry and horny all the time. It made me lash out at my parents over the phone, start fights at work over petty things and sexualize  almost every woman I knew—even when I really didn’t want to. I also couldn’t focus on anything. My original plan was to replace time I spent fapping with practicing guitar. However most days I would not be able to focus on anything because the urges got so bad. The same is true of tasks at work—I saw my productivity drop because I was constantly in some amped up state unable to focus. 

This all came to an end when I realized I had made a very stupid mistake. One of my best friends recently broke up with her long-term bf. We had plans to hang out, and I had been interpreting this as her wanting to hook up. To be clear, in any normal state of mind I would be absolutely against this as our friendship is worth more to me than some awkward post-breakup fling. So before she came over I broke my 22 day streak. 

And I finally felt like myself again. Clear headed, calm and able to be there emotionally for the women in my life. I’ve definitely quit porn for good, however I do believe overall NoFap had a net negative impact on my mental wellbeing. 

I thought I would share this so anyone else who was going through a similar thing. All I hear on this subreddit is how relapsing is bad and the guilt/shame of relapse. I thought I’d share a more positive viewpoint, as I don’t believe that NoFap is for everyone and that’s okay.

30684,Other,[Personal] Effects of Fap on Social Anxiety,"I relapsed last night and wanted to test the social anxiety effect of fapping on myself.

I am a (20-30 year old) Asian who has been headed to gym 5/6 times a week for strength training (squats/deadlifts etc). Effect of which I draw looks from both men and women within my context because I am young and nearly no man here lifts, they are too career, family and Netflix oriented to bother.
 
The day before relapsing I was on for 6 days nofap and noticed a more aggressive stance from myself in everything social. I headed to the mall the whole day today to walk up and down and put myself in situations where I am amongst people.

Consciously noticed status post-fap:

1. If I get unexpectedly (unpreparedly) caught by an attractive girl who looks at myself straight on such that our eyes are pupil to pupil connected - I will turn away as a slight weakness abounds in the heart; anxiety springs forth. Shame? Just unprepared? Regardless there is weakness.

2. Life is duller, this works both ways. You react less to your immediate surrounding, especially to people’s attitude/reaction towards yourself. 

3. People still notice you. Outwardly nothing has changed, unless you react like I did in point 1. I did however react far less to looks from all peoples - towards girls this is very apparent. This is related to point 2., but I had to consciously notice things from the corner of my eye to note men and women reacting to my presence - I can’t just autopilot and notice their reactions instinctually.

All in all,  I wonder what being off PMO will do, it is the last addiction in my life now that chronic gaming is done with.

Anyone else have similar/other experiences?

30754,Advice to NoFap,"On Break Ups due to NoFap, Self Improvement, and NoFap Itself","To anyone who just broke up with their significant other here are my 3 most useful tips:

1. Improve yourself (recover your personal identity with your hobbies and interests, gym, diet, personal projects, etc.)
2. Ask your friends to hangout and for help
3. Accept it as fast as you can and move on

**Regarding self improvement I think the BEST way we can improve ourselves is by doing NoFap.** This TOXIC, DESTRUCTIVE, AND MALIGNANT habit of PMO has damaged my life in the following ways:

1. Little motivation to work on my projects and in life in general
2. Low energy
3. Low libido (even when I had a girlfriend)
4. I see every girl as a category of porn (so sad)
5. Now that I'm single I just want to have sex with a girl for their physical appearance (body) and to not be seen in public with them if they are ugly (face). WTF :(
6. Low self-esteem
7. I feel bad about my self for not being able to quit
8. Shy to talk to beautiful girls even though I know I'm handsome and with a good body and good physical appearance
9. MADE ME EXTREMELY SELFISH IN THE BEDROOM and possibly in other areas of life
10. Too focused on instant gratification
11. I guess it has made me become too angry with others because I'm angry with myself
12. Because I was always focused on my own pleasure I guess I saw all my relationships in terms of ""what pleasure/thing will I get for being with X person"". (What a shitty way to be with my fellow human beings)
13. Made me a desensitized person to enjoy the simple pleasures in life 
14. My erections are not that strong.
15. AND THE WORST: I'M FULL OF SHAME FOR KEEP DOING THIS SHIT. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this post helps anyone who has a girlfriend and/or is tired of PMOing. I'm quitting this TOXIX habit. I'm also quitting looking out for girls and I will reject any girl that has interest in my as they are such a trigger for me for the 90 days of the challenge.

30766,Motivation,Trevor Noah Ottawa Stand Up Comedy - Mentions Not Watching Porn For Two Years,"Was at his comedy show last night in Ottawa and he mentions to the audience that he has not watched pornography for two years. This helped him connect with people and with his girlfriend better, and changed his perspective (and mine) on objectifying women and how intimate sexual and romantic relations work. He says that porn is not natural, and that ""getting right into anal without foreplay is not a real life scenario!"" 

He is a fantastic comedian; he rips on Canadians and questions why we are still living here in the cold, he is a fan of Justin Trudeau, but what really stood out for me was his disconnection with porn.  I am now one day without fap, and it is empowering. Like the previous post before me, I would spend 1 to nearly 2 hours some days just browsing for that perfect video. It feels degrading knowing that I am wasting my time that I can spend with my fiancee or with anything else I can do productively. But Trevor Noah has really opened my eyes to this, and I will give it my absolute best effort to also never watch porn again.

I want to change my life for the better, stop objectifying women, and be a lot more productive. And for those who want to be inspired as well, I encourage you to watch his comedy specials on Netflix. If you like Russell Peters,  Eddie Murphy, Dave Chappelle or just stand up comedy in general, you would probably enjoy Trevor Noah. You can instead spend your time laughing than fapping.

Well anyways I notice that if I dont fap or just abstain from fapping for a week my adderall seems to work 100% and ill get the mental focus and calmness that I fully expected, I can sit there not get distracted by anything and can easily get my work done. but there is always that drive in the back of my mind to fap and get that dopamine release my mind craves. But when I do fap and then take an adderall its as if I took nothing. I get no effect from it. Ill be as distracted as always and it is very noticeable too. 

Could there be a correlation with how adderall works on the brain and the sudden dopamine release we get from sex/fapping? So my mind is expecting more dopamine release from fapping then what the adderall is supposed to do on its own. Or maybe I need to ask my doctor to up my dosage perhaps.

30930,Advice to NoFap,"Try NoFap ""Growth-Mode"" and Reach Your Full Potential (Answer to what counts as a relapse and a general approach to NoFap)","# NoFap ""Growth"" Mode (GM):

This is a method that I designed for myself in answering the question ""What is a relapse?"" and trying to improve the counter system that some find self-defeating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with some definitions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Definition of Relapse:** to slip or fall back into a former worse state.

**Definition of Trigger/Gateway:** a specific activity and/or source of material that could potentially lead to relapse.

**Definition  of Priors:** a list of activities and/or source material that constitutes  a slip or fall back into a former worse state.

**Definition  of Iron-Clad Priors (ICPs):** for most hard-mode practitioners these include  pornography, masturbation, and orgasm (PMO) individually (i e. not in  relation or leading up to one another).

**Streak:** the number of days one has went without committing a prior.

**Reset:** the starting point for one who has committed a prior.

**Definition of Pornography:** any source material (usually digital media) meant solely for the sexual gratification of the viewer.

**Definition of Masturbation:** stimulation of the genitals by any means (most commonly the hands) for sexual pleasure.

**Definition  of Orgasm:** a climax of sexual excitement, characterized by feelings of  pleasure centered in the genitals and (in men) experienced as an  accompaniment to ejaculation.

&amp;#x200B;

The GM philosophy: *growth does not count as relapse*. The GM method requires the participant to be *honest* with oneself. It is a system based on *truthfulness* to oneself and *genuine self-improvement*. If one is not capable of honest introspection, this method will fail. The method is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1- At the beginning of one's streak, one should list all of the priors that they believe constitute a relapse. Most people usually begin their streak with the Iron-Clad Priors (ICPs). For example, one's priors may include the ICPs *in addition to* staying up late browsing seductive social media, sexually stimulating activity such as sleeping naked, and listening to sexually driven lyrics in music. Choosing one's priors is purely introspective as only the individual recognizes those behaviors that diminish their true life potential. If, during the course of one's streak, one commits a prior, then the streak is said to be reset. This process is no different from the regular hard-mode with the exception that the listing of priors at the beginning (other than the ICPs) helps both in the definition of relapse and the participant's successful completion of the growth process.

&amp;#x200B;

2- *Gateways become priors.* After listing priors (those things one believes constitute a relapse), one begins building a streak. However, it is *impossible* to make a perfect list of priors beforehand. For example, continuing off of my first example, one may come across a seductive fan-fiction on their journey. Obviously, the fan-fiction violates an ICP:  it is source material that is meant solely for sexual stimulation and, above all, detracts from the personal growth of the individual. However, for this particular individual, fan-fiction was never a part of their previous porn-addicted lifestyle (their previous state) and, as such, does *not* constitute a relapse. Instead, this source material is to considered a *trigger* or a *gateway* since it has the potential of leading to relapse. Once realized, the individual should mark the gateway as a  prior, in which case returning to the activity would count as a relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

**How gateways lead to relapse, an example: (NSFW, potentially arousing to some readers)**

&gt;!We've all been there. Your surfing YouTube when you see a seductive  thumbnail. Curious, you look into the thumbnails origins. ""Ah, she's a  popular gymnast..."" Then you remember that one porn-star that could really bend. 1. 2. 3. Your hand, and relapse, are in motion. This all started with one gateway: the seductive thumbnail. The hardest part of GM is catching yourself in the train of  thought above and adding the gateway to your prior list (""No more thumbnails for me, that's bad news!""). However, after repeated efforts (relapses), I would say five, most people have built a pretty solid list  of priors to keep conscious of on their journey. One can then adjust  their life in such a way as to avoid one's priors (""You know, I'm on week two and I'll be vulnerable, maybe I'll lay off on the YouTube for a week"").!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are some down-to-earth examples:**

&amp;#x200B;

*""I just spent a couple hours on social media staring at seductive models. I did not masturbate (i.e. did not break an ICP) but I quickly realized that I needed to stop, so I logged out. Does this count as a relapse?""*

&amp;#x200B;

Be honest with yourself: was social media hunting something you used to actively partake in for sexual gratification (i.e. a known prior)? Then yes, you have relapsed because you have returned to the old way of doing things. On the other hand, was this something that you recently discovered? Is it the case that, realizing your social isolation and loneliness, you  decided to check out women on Instagram or Tinder only to realize that you are re-stimulating dopamine pathways? Then no, you haven't relapsed, you have merely identified a potential gateway, and should now mark this as a prior.

&amp;#x200B;

*""I was just edging, does this count as a relapse?""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Unless  you previously masturbated completely *hands-free*, then yes, you have  relapsed since you have returned to your old habits. The easiest way to avoid breaking the last two ICPs (M and O) is simply not to touch your genitals unless for general hygiene.

&amp;#x200B;

*""I came across some pornography, realized what I was doing, and quickly closed the browser. Is this a relapse?""*

&amp;#x200B;

You need to be honest. Did you ""come across"" the pornography by actively searching for it in your web browser? In which case you have relapsed, as this a return to your old ways (a prior). Or did you come across a naked/revealing webpage  while surfing a back-alley website and, not wanting to be triggered (a gateway), clicked away? That's most certainly not a relapse. *Do not* reset your counter and risk using that as an excuse to relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

3- *Grow.* Continue your NoFap journey as you build a list of priors out of the activities that trigger you. Learn about yourself in a very human way and discover the behaviors that you want to remove from your life. And, if it comes to relapse (i.e. you broke a prior intentionally or a gateway leads to relapse), pick yourself back up and start a new journey on the progress of your old one. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to growing your list of priors (I recommend writing them down to internalize them), start making real changes in your life: go to the gym, start self-grooming, take cold showers. And, I believe, your (and my life) can really change for the better. ",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ak39p4/try_nofap_growthmode_and_reach_your_full/

I think I have quite severe ED because I have no morning woods and basically no sexual desire at all. I have problems with erection for quite a long time I do not remember the last time I had morning wood and I fapped almost every day even tho I did not really have big urge to do so but It just felt good and relaxing. I currently have girlfriend and when we tried to have sex I was not aroused even after long foreplay (even tho she is really hot and I love her) and I could not get an erection. I went to my G.P. and asked her for viagra/sildenafil, so next time we tried to have sex I tried 50mg and then next time 100mg and I still could not get hard with her. Since then I started nofap and I am 15 days in, so far I do not feel anything (I know it is too early planning to last at least  3 months probably longer), I  still have no urges, I am not horny and I feel kinda asexual.

the first theory is your semen is made up of the same properties of the immortal jelly fish, and by reserving your semen you will never age.


second theory is, semen takes a part of your life your mortality and preserving semen you can live a longer life


third theory is, the sex organs, that man only ages according to his sex organs and if they can do a sex organ transplant you will never grow old, because your body will just follow the younger new sex organ implants


there are also a few indian mystics who claimed to have attained immortality through brahmacharya.1)swami vivekananda 2)Bhima(from the mahabarata story, claims because he had semen retension for 12 years could choose the time of his death)
ect

31157,Telling my Story,The Start of an Experiment.,"So, obviously coming across this subreddit is quite the spectacle at first, the concept behind it especially. However, through intensive research and a lot of really depressing episodes, I've decided to become a complete and utter masochist and make a New Years Resolution that I'm growing to hate. No ""Diddly"" for a year. None. Dip. Squat. Nothin'. I've stuck to it and gotten past the 3 week-strain-process that my brain does when it doesn't like something, telling it to effectively F-Off. I'm sticking to it this time around, and I'll be posting my (probably weekly) experience, this being week 3 and a half. So far... I'm depressed and numb to the world, I am tired all of the time, but that is to be expected so I'm not to worried about it. Plus, week 2 was much worse so something is getting better, or I'm just getting used to the drag. Anyways, I'll probably upload more every Saturday, just to keep my sanity in check and to talk to people.

31276,Motivate Me,My never ending struggle,"I recently told a girl I liked her which the anticipation up to that had been a big reason I was able to best all my urges. Although she didn't reject me she I ended up asking her on a date (stupid probably before I found out if she had feelings for me) and she said that because she had just gotten out of a relationship she didn't want to jump into a new one then proceeded to day she wasn't saying no but she wasn't saying yes o.O

I'm honestly fine with it I just couldn't live with the what if possibility and now I can move on to pursuing other girls (we were and still are friends). Now here comes the problem. I talk to a lot of girls (thanks to NoFap) but none that I feel comfortable enough to see myself getting physical with in the future (me and this chick had drunken cuddled a few times). I ended up watching a very sexy car wash which interestingly enough is what I started on 7 years ago before I began watching porn.

It was only like 3 minutes long and after that I was done but then I had a wet dream (first one in years) and another one within like 24 hrs. My urges have come roaring back and I feel like I'm at the beginning of a streak again the temptation is so great and it's been so long since I've felt the pain of relapse it's begun to fade from my memory. My dilemma is should I be focusing on trying to escalate with other women or just focus on myself? I know what I want to do, what it feels like I NEED to do and I know what I should ideally do.

31403,Journal Check-In,"I told myself I could break away, but that was the worst thing to do","I started my NoFap journey back in November. I was lost then, watching porn with no self-respect. However, I finally took control of my life and got on this platform. My first streak was 10 days, then 15, then 14, all without porn. I was proud and I really felt like I was making progress. 

Then, I binged a little bit around Christmas time. I straightened myself up and told myself I would not falter in 2019. I really believed in myself. I almost made it again to my longest streak of 15 days. I even had an accountability partner (shoutout to him; he's really helped).

However, I really began to slip up in mid-January. I started masturbating when I felt like it. Keep in mind that it was without porn, but nonetheless a habit. I rationalized the behavior with the excuse that I was feeling legitimate attraction to females (I actually was. I was making social progress). However, that turned out to be a nasty backdoor entrance into a world of problems.

Each time I masturbated ""legitimately,"" I would falter the next day too, or even the same day (this time, for no reason but addiction). I even started using pornography again. I told myself that I didn't need NoFap anymore (partly because 70% of this community's post are stale memes and completely ludicrous pseudoscience).

And here I am. I used porn again. That makes twice in the last two weeks, essentially at the worst of where I was before I even started this journey.

So, here's what I'm gonna do. I am gonna journal on the daily here, because I think that in the heat of the moment, I can reference back to this moment. I have the tendency to throw caution to the wind when I get aroused and forget the big picture.

However, in all seriousness, I would love to see this sub become more serious and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, please can we not continue with the ""semen retention,"" ""superpowers,"" and pseudoscience. Yes, participating in this community will help you regain confidence if you're an addict, and yes, if you're not always masturbating, you will have more energy. However, the ""superpowers"" you get are nothing more that a stronger sense of self, confidence, and more energy to spend.

I have found the following ways are the reason for relapse which may be the same for most you guys too ( I presume)

1.Being Alone. Even though you are strict on Nofap there'll be a situation where you are alone and your inner demon will urge you to do that since no one sees you and it'll be only you and you alone.Please avoid being alone for first 14 days

2. Try to keep yourself busy from time to time. Hitting the gym and sports will get your tired and busy and you'll fall asleep as soon as you reach home.

3. Avoid late night phone usage even though it's for learning purpose

31679,Confession,Help me. 17 yo guy seeking advice/telling his story.,"(side-note: I have a main Reddit account which I'm active on this subreddit with, been trying and failing at NoFap for about a year, currently on a 4 Day Streak. Wanted to make a new account because I feel embarrassed to tell you guys the truth)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 17, and moved countries a lot when I was younger, from Europe where I was born, to Asia, and now to Oceania. Because of this I lost all of my friends and at around 15 it's really hard to fit in with people since everyone's friend groups are already established, especially in a foreign country. Because of this I've isolated myself for years. I couldn't find anyone! I would try my best to fit in but that's just not me man. Now at 17 I don't have any friends, and don't feel the need to find any at this point. But I think that's a result of me isolating myself and numbing my loneliness. Everyday for the last two years I've been sitting at my desk, playing games and watching videos. I ended up becoming a semi-professional gamer, which was great, but I quit that. I'm now at a point where I'm starting to realize what my reality is like. I used to fap a lot of times a day to get over my loneliness, numb the pain that I was going through, and seek comfort and company in these pornstars. I mean I was latching onto anything that would make me feel better, especialyl when I didn't yet know the effects of masturbation and porn. So yeah, Nofap, I've been doing that, and I've started to come face to face with reality partly because of it. And I HATE it. Everyday I go on it's like my eyes open to what I've been doing everyday for the past years. I'm not taking care of myself, I barely shower, I eat whatever I see, I sit on my chair for HOURS and hours sometimes just staring at a blank screen or refreshing Twitter every second. I fucking hate this guys. This is NOT me. When I was 10 years I was the funniest and happiest kid ever, had good friends and was always doing something... 

&amp;#x200B;

(oh also I dropped out of school and have had little to no responsibilities for these two years)

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I struggle with is my mind. Man I think constantly, and 90% of the time it's about negative stuff, or just stupid imaginations like anxiety. I get attacked by tons of inferiority complex situations, like oh this guy is famous and he does this, so I'm not as good as him etc etc. It's poison. It's really fucking me up. I feel like this has to do with me sitting on my ass all day though. Hear me out. When I'm watching videos, it's usually about health stuff, bioenergetics, exercise, self development. I learn a ton about the mind, the body, how it works...But I NEVER put this stuff to use! I just have it in my head. Anyways, I learned a lot about the mind and the body because of what I watch. And what I've come to theorize because of it is that I'm so fucked in my mind because I'm not using my body. I'm sitting in my chair all day with nothing to do. So of course my mind is gonna go insane, right? Isn't there a quote about ""if there are no problems, the mind will make some""? Yeah that's me right now. And it's severe.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. What do I do? I don't know where to begin, all I know is that I fucking hate where I'm at and how my mind works at the moment, my body feels weak (probably because I do nothing all day) and I have no one I can call a friend, apart from my brothers and some people online. Everyday that goes on with NoFap I just start too see shit for what it is and I'm DONE. This is the lowest moment of my life and I need help.

31990,Telling my Story,Do Antidepressants help with NoFap?,"I was a very, very heavy porn user. I'm 24 and masturbated constantly growing up. Which caused me to not have any friends and remain a virgin. I used to constantly watch all sorts of fucked up fetish porn. I also used to masturbate every single day, morning and night.

I am now 110 days without porn and masturbating.

It's kind of crazy how easy it has been. I thought it would be a lot more difficult, but it's been pretty much smooth sailing.

I started taking Zoloft around two months ago. I was also on risperidone and mirtazapine.

I feel like maybe the Zoloft has diminished my sex drive? I don't know. I just find myself not really interested in porn. It feels like a lifetime ago.

I also smoke marijuana and drink beer, and never really had the desire to masturbate. There was one time though, where I got drunk and high and did masturbate, but that was when I was trying to get off risperidone and wasn't on Zoloft.

I suffer from anxiety and depression. Zoloft has really helped me and has made me feel better. 

I just worry about the future. What if I get a girlfriend and can't satisfy her sexually, things like that worry me.

But yeah, I feel so much better now that I quit watching porn. Porn is poison and does nothing good for me. My friends say I look happier and that my face is brighter, they asked if I was using some sort of lotion, which I wasn't.

I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. By that I mean, how long can I keep going and how long should I keep going? My therapist told me not to masturbate for at least a year, so that is my main goal.

What happens if you don't masturbate for a year? I am going to do my best to find out.

I do worry about getting too drunk. So I usually just stick with beer and weed. If I were to drink vodka, I feel like I might slip up. With weed I feel pretty in control, same with beer. Just vodka fucking scares me and I don't see any point indulging in it.

I really used to watch the most fucked up porn you could ever imagine. Haha just google Nanny Goat Punishment Nursery, I was into that kind of stuff and got off on it daily.

32040,Telling my Story,The AVN Awards are next door,"I’m in Las Vegas for work this week and as I write this the adult video (network?) awards are happening less then a couple hundred yards from my room.  

Its truly a strange feeling.

I wondered all day...  would I catch a glimpse or walk past one of the many women I have looked at on a computer screen in my struggle against porn? 

Would I even recognize them outside the confines of a MacBook ?

Would we make eye contact?  would my eyes reveal that I had seen them in the most intimate, beautiful thing you can share with another person in the world?

Would I be embarrassed/ashamed and look the other way?

Would she smile and say hello if we passed each other in a hotel hallway?

What if I just went up to her and asked for a hug? Would the physical realization of a hug help me to understand that this is a real person...not just pixels on a screen. That she has feelings and complexities just like I do. 

Would she feel my guilt and sadness thru that hug?...that I’m sorry I have at times reduced her to a less then a person just to get off and feed an addiction that I wish I could get rid of more then anything.

I know none of that will happen. And At this moment i am strong in my battle against porn....I am very thankful though that these women (and men) that I have watched online too many times to possibly count are so close. It makes me understand that my choices and actions are real and they are ppl too who are deserving of love, kindness, forgiveness and others lifting them up in their struggles like you have all done for me at times.

I’m really glad the avn awards are next door.  And I’m even more thankful for this network of people helping me to not to look at porn.

32136,New to NoFap,Mastrubation without porn ok?,"Hey guys,

I came here because I've noticed a pied during intercourse with Tinderdates. Usually the first round
(which lasts about 3h !!BIG REDFLAG!!) is ok. After that
it is a 50/50 chance to get it back up and a 3rd round is almost impossible. A few years back I could go countless, much shorter rounds.

I started watching porn at 18 (first intercourse at 15)
and now 7 years later it is the same story. New categories, weird stuff until I can't really get fully hard on porn anymore. After 4-5 days, I literally have to masturbate (without porn) or it will do it ""itself"" during night. I feel like I have no chance.

I have made a Testosteron blood test and the doctor told me that 35nmol/l is a very good number, triple of what his sons have. (told him about the ed)

So to my questions: 
1. Do you think I should drop weightlifting and eating healthy for a while to calm my sexual desire with lower testo and libido? 
2. Should I masturbate (I don't have to do much) or let it happen during night?
3. Considering that I started porn rather late, how much time do you think I need to recover? Lets be real... I can't do it for 4 month, a week is hard enough.
4. Is someone here who wants to start a nofap challenge with me (same day)? Maybe it is easier this way

I am still getting morning wood, idk if thats a good or bad sign. I noticed that if you masturbate once or twice  a week you get flooded with dopamine and you feel so powerful, while doing multiple sessions a day feels not so great and gets you tired and sad :S

Thank you in advance

But next week I have an exam and I have stopped talking to her the moment I left the place where we met. Just to make sure that there is a gap between us. I really want her to be my partner but can't do it right now as she is not interested in relationship and I can't afford to make her accept it. Means I can't waste my time and energy as I AM still.

Reaching orgasm while having sex is not my goal anymore and my girlfriend approves this and knows that if I can't, it's not because of her, but because of my brain that has to rewire. The last few times, I had great sex and I am thankful for that. It makes both my gf and me feel so great, after 2 and a half years of having a way below average sexual relationship. A new level in our relationship has been reached!

Some backstory:
I have a girlfriend since 2 and a half years now. It was a blessing that I was able to get her, when I was still addicted to PMO. Addicted to the point that I PMO'ed as often as I could stand, where I once started launching porn in the car when I was driving home from work and where I once cried after PMO'ing after I JUST decided that I should quit doing that after time X of PMO'ing that day. It was a blessing to find out that PMO made me unable to feel sexually attracted to my girlfriend like I should have been feeling (she's beautiful, cute and Asian, what I personally like). 

I was shocked after I first PMO'ed when I was in the relationship with my gf, because I felt that is not something a man in a relationship should do. So I swore it off. Yet, it kept happening, I had no control over myself. I'm still proud and thankful to myself the day that I told her about it. She first was a bit shocked to hear, but she really appreciated me telling her that and she is still very supportive now.

32250,Journal Check-In,Day 31: A Wet Dream—Real Test of NoFap Begins,"Before I found this sub, I already noticed that nofapping for 2-3 weeks, drastically improved my psychological state. I thought it was caused by complete lack of orgasms, so I thought to continue feeling that way, I would have to give up the hope of ever having a girlfriend while maintaining that psychological state. Such hypothesis was confirmed true when I would see prostitutes to get release instead of fapping. When a wet dream occurred in the past, I would relapse and start fapping right away, thinking that having an orgasm ended my streak of ""superpowers""...

Reading the posts on this sub, I saw people claiming that wet dreams and healthy sexual relationships with people you care about did not fuck you over and were not the same as relapsing. I hoped those claims to be true, but in the back of my mind was dubious about them.

Well, just a day after posting here, raving about how NoFap changed my life, I get to test whether the claims of wet dreams not affecting your streak are true: I just had one of those. It was a very sexual dream and as I was about to drift back to consciousness, I felt the release and woke up. Momentarily, I thought the entire thing was just part of the dream, but when I checked my underwear in the bathroom, I realized the release part was real.

I just took a shower and panicking a bit. I have zero desire to PMO right now and just really wish I will not revert back to my usual socially-awkward, shy, hermit self. 

Just yesterday, I looked around a few dating sites for a bit, thinking I gotta start finding a girlfriend. That intense feeling, intense drive to seek human connection is gone now. I'm worried everything else is gone as well and I'm at Day 0 state now.

Am I fucked?

Fuck :'(

----------------------------------

EDIT: I think I'm going to be OK-ish. It's been ~2 hours. I'm not feeling any existential dread or shame that usually sets in like 20 minutes after I relapse. I also went down to my building's laundry room to do a load and ran into another person there. I felt a bit jumpy and not very eager to engage them socially, although I did not feel the usual anxiety I felt when I PMOed.

I think I feel something like how I felt around 10th streak day now. Not super elated, but not depressed or anxious either. Though, the release also took the edge off and I don't feel... ""desperate""... for female company any more. I'm hoping in the next couple of days I'm going to get back to the super-amazing several days that come around 3rd week of a normal streak.

I'm not sure if it was a he or a she because the sex changed multiple times.   
Barely anything happened, before we could engage in sexual activity I O'd.

I thought i could control my urges, I thought that I was the master of my own thoughts...until I got home. 

Stumbling in after a few blunts and a couple cups of beer I got a overwhelming wave of loneliness. I swear in my head I began to think ""fuck it, you've been alone for years so no one is going to care if you do the deed."" but I cared. It felt like i didnt have control of shit.

Needless to say i did the deed and I felt so shitty after I finished. Satisfied with the instant wave of happiness but it following those feelings, I felt ashamed. I. felt. Ashamed. I couldnt believe I folded so easily and I wouldve been celebrated 10 days.

So I start by saying to my parents I'm going to take a cold shower, my mother doesn't believe me obviously but I don't care what she says and go for it anyway, I was honestly quite anxious I wouldn't be able to make it for even a second or so but I was proved wrong by myself once again.

I twisted the dial as far onto the blue as it would go and flicked the switch up to on.

My arm was immediately struck by an almost icy blast of cold water and I pulled back quickly.

""Damn."" 

""Screw it."" I said louder than I thought I did 

And jumped in with brevity and bravery 

Freezing was all I could I think of and I altered between going in and out of the water flow every few seconds. Eventually it became 5 then 7 until I was fully under the shower and completely soaked. Something about it though was making me laugh out loud, I was shivering like an addict but it didn't matter because I was enjoying myself at this point. 

I had perhaps the quickest shower of my entire life today. Normally I'd just stand in the shower for ages and take in the nice heat on my body but that doesn't compare to what I experienced with the cold. Both are enjoyable in their own right but I can say that after having the cold shower I do feel better and in a livelier state as well as a good mood.

I understand it's not for everyone but if you haven't already then I'd give it a try.

&amp;nbsp;
if you cannot stop for 90 days, COLD

&amp;nbsp;
then you are addicted.

&amp;nbsp;
I don't care if you try to justify it

&amp;nbsp;
most of this country is addicted to porn 

&amp;nbsp;
and then don't even realize it

&amp;nbsp;
I may not have had a severe addiction,

&amp;nbsp;
I may have only done it a few times a week, or whatever.

&amp;nbsp;
but I couldn't control it

&amp;nbsp;
it consumed me

&amp;nbsp;
I knew I didn't want to masturbate

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
does the ultimate version of myself masturbate?

&amp;nbsp;
does the person of my dreams

&amp;nbsp;
who I could be,

&amp;nbsp;
does this ultimate person, masturbate?

&amp;nbsp;
of course not! 

&amp;nbsp;
what a solitary

&amp;nbsp;
pathetic

&amp;nbsp;
self indulgent behavior!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
go out into the world!

&amp;nbsp;
explore 

&amp;nbsp;
meet people

&amp;nbsp;
women

&amp;nbsp;
connect

&amp;nbsp;
become one with the world

&amp;nbsp;
your self

&amp;nbsp;
your conciousness

&amp;nbsp;
and each other

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
Don't justify it

&amp;nbsp;
it is just your addiction talking

&amp;nbsp;
it is just your darkness

&amp;nbsp;
that seeks to destroy you

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
conquer this addiction!

&amp;nbsp;
cut yourself off completely

&amp;nbsp;
don't justify it.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
You know deep inside you don't really want to do this.

&amp;nbsp;
Learn from your mistakes

&amp;nbsp;
and find the strategies that work for you

&amp;nbsp;
and continue

&amp;nbsp;
to pursue

&amp;nbsp;
to push on

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
For in order to free ourselves from these addictions

&amp;nbsp; 
these chains on our life

&amp;nbsp;
that keep us from actualizing our truest potential

&amp;nbsp;
the complete perfection of our conciousness

&amp;nbsp;
that keep us away from who we want to be at the end of it all,

&amp;nbsp;
we have to cut it out completely

&amp;nbsp;
destroy it, leave no traces

&amp;nbsp;
free yourself from this bondage

&amp;nbsp;
in a blaze of glory

&amp;nbsp;
in a fell swoop

&amp;nbsp; 

&amp;nbsp;
and you will become greater

&amp;nbsp;
than you could have possibly imagined

 I was in this mental state of dizziness caused by the lack of sleep. 
Food didn't taste at all and I was just a couch potato at this time.

Whenever I'm tired I get horny so I browsed the net and this sudden urge kicked in and I  browsed a few pictures of hot girls. 
I wanted to give in but I am in such a good streak.
So I immediately closed the laptop and went to the gym instead.

Now I'm back and feeling great and full of energy. 
The urge disappeared and I can say with confidence that I am proud of myself for the choice I made.

So to all of you out there on the edge of relapsing, go out for a drive, go to the gym, meet your mates etc.

32490,Success Story,Not yet free but Massive progress has been made.,"So based off my progress so far, I can tell I will likely never be relapsing again. The urges are finally beginning to die down, and my motivation is slowly coming back to me. No longer when I look in the mirror do I see only a monster who has nothing but to be ashamed of myself, but I am beginning to see myself, a real person, with real accomplishments to be proud of, and let me prove it:

I have gotten back on track to win best chess player in my division (Highschool team, but still a hell of an accomplishment) and really helped my team get on track to win best team in the division. 
I just completed midterms , with an A on every one of them (besides one AP class I take all honors).
Just this morning, I found the motivation to make breakfast for my family and clean up a chunk of the mess (just eggs and pork roll but still)
I have been able to talk to women without my eyes drifting downward as often, meaning I am finally seeing them as people, not objects. This one is especially important because at 16, I don’t want to think about sex and all that crap. I just wanna focus on doing well in school so I can hopefully get a scholarship to Princeton,

Like every other person, I have had my falls (none of which included fapping), but what matters is I am actually happy about my successes now, I don’t just brush them off and dwell on my failures only.

My dudes, currently I'm on my 8th day of NoFap and my confidence is on the clouds.
You see, since I have crooked theeth and my right leg is noticiaby less muscular than the left one, confidence has never been my strong point and I would be very self concious of my smile and my limp. But now all that has changed.
Since I live in southamerica we are currently on summer season and I'm spending my vacations in the beach. Now, to the point hahaha.
Yestarday I was at the beach and wanted to ask someone if they could borrow me their raquets to play tenis mith my brother and decided that I would ask the most hot girl I could find to test my confidence. Suprisingly, it worked! When I asked a girl for her raquets I looked her in the eyes and never thought about if she thought I was weird or ugly and she even was with some intimidating male friends. I felt like a million dollars!
Before no fap I would've asked some ugly girl and I would've been nervious anyway, but now things are starting to change.
I don't know why exactly I felt so sure about myself but what I do know is that there's something more to this NoFap thing rather than just chemical changes in oursalves. (May be exagerating a bit)

32549,Success Story,Citicoline/CDP-Choline is a miracle supplement,"Hey all, this is my first post on reddit (i know i have been living under a rock), but since ive been lurking around as a reader and learned so much, i feel like giving back to the community.

Iam 31 years old male and i was introduced to p*rn when i was in 6th grade and started fapping when i was in 7th grade. I developed serious anxiety issues and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder by thr time i reached 10th grade and it never got better. I was very active in sports though, but had no idea fapping cld be messing with my head.

Back then it was just photos on the web and some short porn clips, few years later, we got high speed internet and it made things worse. I had a girlfriend and still i felt the need to fap watching p*rn. We got married and had a good sex life but the p*rn and fapping continued. Very soon the sex life started dying as she didnt turn me on anymore, neither did her touch nor a thought of having sex with anyone else. It was just p*rn, but also because we were having loads of arguements and the relationship was going through the rocks. We got divorced and i was single for 2 years, i had a couple of hookups but i was mainly fapping to p*rn almost everyday. 

Then i moved to canada and met this wonderful gorgeous woman on a dating app, we fell in love. When we got on it and i saw her naked, i felt like iam trapped within my own body. She had the kind of body and we had the kind of connection which made me feel dying to feel passionate and horny, but it felt like that iam trapped and my body isnt responding. That is when i realised that iam badly effed up. So i started digging into stuff, arranged some cialis for the time being and shared my story with her. I feel so blessed to have her because she still wanted to be with me and support me heal myself.

I tried test boosters, horny goat weed, zinc and what not but nothing made a passionste kiss make me feel something down there. Then i started reading about choline and acetyl choline and i wondered that maybe it can help me, i lift weights, have been into sports, i need more brain power. So i decided to give it a shot.. and believe me, 5 days into it with a 10 day no PMO, we had amazing sex today. I made her have 2 orgasms and i didnt ejaculate myself with the help of some self control, but it felt better than ever, i didnt miss having an orgasm at all.

Current lifestyle:
- Intermittent fasting ranging from 16-20 hrs of fast
- lifting 3 times a week and 1 day cardio

Supplementation:
- Cdp Choline - started with 250 mg a day and bumped to 500mg

- 3 grams Alcar in the morning

- 2grams fish oil with dha

- 4000iu vit D, 120mcg k2 and 300mg calc citrate

- 25mg zinc

- tribulus extract twice a day, by allmax

- 120mg gingko extract twice a day

- raw cacao powder and maca root powder in my protein smoothies everyday

Ive been taking all of that for a few months now, the only new addition was cdp choline. I know it can cause depression but i believe it also depends on how much acetylcholine your lifestyle demands. A research showed that marathon runners use up a lpt of acetylcholine for firing motor neurons during a run (dont have the link handy right now)

Hope it helps the people here, stay strong brothers! Thank you for all the knowledge that you guys share here.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/akdv5n/citicolinecdpcholine_is_a_miracle_supplement/

A friend sent me one of the hottest girls in my schools nudes the other day but I didn’t even touch my dick. Keep in mind this is someone I’ve fantasized over for the better part of a half decade. I told myself that I couldn’t and I just thought about the feeling of regret and failure. I’ve had plenty of opportunities to fap, but something about it is lame to me now.

32560,Advice to NoFap,Here’s a thought: Relapses aren’t “normal”,"I know this may be controversial or may even hurt some people’s feelings but bear with me here... 

I learned about NoFap in Dec 2017. All last year (2018), I never made it past 20 days. Whenever I’d relapse, I’d try to make myself feel better by going onto Reddit and look for a top-rated post of someone who would make sense of their relapse and talk about how they are going to actually make it this time... 

It made me feel like my decision to relapse was *justified* in way, and that *allowed me to believe that relapsing was okay.*

It’s **BULLSHIT!!!**

If you’re serious about actually quitting this horrible, horrible habit, then please understand that you need to cultivate a mindset where you have **absolutely **ZERO** tolerance for Porn and Masturbation!**

By telling yourself that it’s okay you relapsed, you are actually subconsciously allowing your mind to think that it’s okay to relapse- and then you wonder why you can’t get to 30, 60, 90, 180, 365, 1000+ days!?

That’s your answer right there. 

*You are allowing yourself to believe that relapsing is OKAY!!*

When you post on r/NoFap fishing for upvotes trying to make yourself feel better after you relapse, the people that do make you feel better about relapsing, are the *same ones* stuck in the trap with you!! 👁

Fuck your feelings. And Fuck your delicate ego. Quit PMOing and become the person you are destined to be. No one is going to wait for you. You are only hurting yourself. 

Maybe I have some extra testosterone in me this morning, but today is my rest day from the gym so screw it I’m laying it all out on here.

Tough love for you all 🖤

32603,Advice to NoFap,Do antidepressants help with this journey?,"I was a very, very heavy porn user. I'm 24 and masturbated constantly growing up. Which caused me to not have any friends and remain a virgin. I used to constantly watch all sorts of fucked up fetish porn. I also used to masturbate every single day, morning and night.

I am now 110 days without porn and masturbating.

It's kind of crazy how easy it has been. I thought it would be a lot more difficult, but it's been pretty much smooth sailing.

I started taking Zoloft around two months ago. I was also on risperidone and mirtazapine.

I feel like maybe the Zoloft has diminished my sex drive? I don't know. I just find myself not really interested in porn. It feels like a lifetime ago.

I also smoke marijuana and drink beer, and never really had the desire to masturbate. There was one time though, where I got drunk and high and did masturbate, but that was when I was trying to get off risperidone and wasn't on Zoloft.

I suffer from anxiety and depression. Zoloft has really helped me and has made me feel better.

I just worry about the future. What if I get a girlfriend and can't satisfy her sexually, things like that worry me.

But yeah, I feel so much better now that I quit watching porn. Porn is poison and does nothing good for me. My friends say I look happier and that my face is brighter, they asked if I was using some sort of lotion, which I wasn't.

I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. By that I mean, how long can I keep going and how long should I keep going? My therapist told me not to masturbate for at least a year, so that is my main goal.

What happens if you don't masturbate for a year? I am going to do my best to find out.

I do worry about getting too drunk. So I usually just stick with beer and weed. If I were to drink vodka, I feel like I might slip up. With weed I feel pretty in control, same with beer. Just vodka fucking scares me and I don't see any point indulging in it.

I really used to watch the most fucked up porn you could ever imagine. 

Porn is poison and it's a drug. A horrible drug that causes nothing but pain and misery.

I'm still learning as I go and I have a lot of work to do. Therapy has helped a lot.

32607,Telling my Story,"I realized I don't want sex, but blind pleasure","I'm about so complete 2 weeks of abstinence. I've failed many many many times for PMOing in about 7 days usually. Sometimes I would reach two weeks and fail as well.

This time, for whatever reason, I realized that what I've been seeking is actually only masturbation pleasure, not the will of having real sex with a real person. While fighting urges, I started developing strategies to say to myself that probably PMOing would be ok, and since repeating that specialists say that ejaculating frequently is good to prevent prostrate cancer, for example, and that all the other guys do it as well, which already sounds mainstream for me, the new strategy I developed was to build fetishes, specially a kind of fetish I can experience by myself.

By realizing what I was thinking, I came to the conclusion that all this time I haven't been seeking real sex (through PMO), but solely the pleasure from masturbation and orgasm. This made me understand how fucked up I am right now, and how screwed is my reward system, thanks to porn addiction.

I'm and aspiring artist and I have no pleasure by studying or making my own art. From time to time, I have a flatline and I ask myself why am I even pursuing this; I sometimes see no reason to wake up the next morning, honestly.

I don't want to live like this anymore. I'm tired of being unhappy, and I'm sure that porn addiction, which I use to solve my loneliness problem, has a great part on this.

32717,Journal Check-In,Day 2 complete.,"After being held to a higher standard by a NoFap sub Reddit member, I reset my counter after peeking at porn. It wasn’t full blown PMO, but still he helped me realise I am still giving in to addiction by peeking - so thank you u/BorisC91!

Day 2 complete. I have been retaining semen for 10 days and had a wet dream last night. After a cold shower this morning, I got rid of most of my grogginess. I definitely feel like I’m flatlining right now, nothing is really exciting me. I don’t have any drive to do anything other than the basics of every day survival (eating etc lol). Also my concentration levels are low (although this could be due to tiredness as I haven’t been able to sleep at night due to having that ‘charged’ feeling when retaining semen). I tried watching a documentary and could hardly focus. This tells me I need to be regular with meditation.
In the past, when I’ve been meditating twice per day (20-40 minutes at a time) my concentration was great. I was dialled into conversations and could pick up on the most minute of details. So yes, I will start doing this again. 

On another note, I went to a leaving party last night and my social anxiety is diminishing the more streaks a go on with NF. I was feeling more fluid in conversation, I could hold eye contact and wasn’t having to wrack my brain for the right word to say a lot of the time. By no means perfect, I still feel nervous when speaking to people but it’s better controlled (I think cold showers help here as one of the benefits is better impulse control).

Cold showers are definitely a must for me on this journey. Before my most recent 7 day streak, I was constantly relapsing day after day after day. It was really getting to me. I resorted to a cold shower to give me a mental reset as I was caught up in a loop and thankfully it worked. I’ve been taking daily cold showers since (warm shower followed by 3-5 minutes on the coldest setting).

Thanks for reading.

How do you CONNECT with a girl in person and ENJOY your time together. For me I’ve always been pretty good at attracting and picking up women. Afterwards I can have good conversations over the phone or text but when we see each other in person it’s like all the years of Pmo come back to haunt me and I get lost. Than she gets bored and kinda loses interest. Although I’ve been trying not to make sex a motivation for my interactions with women but it’s always a good bonus I seem to miss out right when I have it because I get “lame” or “lost” whenever we are in person. Girls that I find unattractive or have no intention to have sex with always really really like me and try to be my “bestfriend” because I CONNECT with them so well and I’m able to be myself around them.

I’d like to give myself the title of not fapping for the entirety of 2019 but after that streak I admittedly did give up a little. That leads me to now, having just lost an eight day streak from another hands free nut. I really, *really* want to get rid of my porn addiction. I’ve told my friends about it and told them that I’d like support from it but of course I’m at the age where masturbation is considered cool and everyone is addicted to porn so they just discourage me instead (no hard feelings to them, I had the same opinions a few months back). I’ve tried blocking out most of my porn sources in any way I can, but of course I can bypass that when stupid and horny. I’ve considered meditation but seem to forget about it when I come to look at porn. I’d rather not tell my parents, too. So I need help. Does it get easier if I keep trying?

32820,Question to NoFap,Confused about my personal “addiction”,"Hello NoFap. I’m in my early 20s and am currently on a streak of 5 days. I’ve been aware of this subreddit for around a year now and have made three separate attempts to stop PMO. I made a first attempt to stop PMO last year in response to the advice to see if you can go 30 days without PMO. If you can easily make it 30 days then you probably don’t have an addiction to porn. My longest streak was 7 days. I believe the reason that number is so low compared to some of the marathon Fapstronauts here is because I don’t personally believe that porn has wrecked my life or that masterbation is wiping away my confidence and making me lazy. PMO has always been something that Ive kept well hidden and in the far peripherals of my life. Nobody knows I watch porn at night and masterbate. To be honest, it seems to be harmless. I never get depressed after, nor do I hate myself for doing it. Now, i’ve seen all the Ted talks and the articles and research about porn and why it is indeed destructive to our brains yet it doesn’t seem to convict me. I haven’t even been disappointed after a relapse. The fact that I couldn’t get 30 days scared me. 

I did get far enough, however, to catch a glimpse of some of the benefits of NoFap. I had oodles of energy, I felt clear and confident, and invigorated. I really want this. I am a naturally quiet, “chill” guy and I have trouble with motivation, procrastination, and for sure not confident (good lord I would never initiate a conversation with a cute girl on my own). I put away those unwanted traits during my streaks and it was undeniably what I want for myself forever. 

In conclusion, I need some comments to help steer my thoughts about NoFap. Is this necessary? How much does porn actually have a grip on me? etc.. Because I’m having trouble seeing the negatives in their full glory right now. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/akgd6t/confused_about_my_personal_addiction/

Stumbled upon this page this morning, and couldn't stop reading the ""NoFap"" posts. The whole PMO thing + reset/relapse + the chaser effect and what not? Surely the most relatable page I have ever seen and the most wanted one too. 

I am suffering from an ED (which I think is surely because of excessive porn \[ I recently celebrated my 10th anniversary of watching porn. \*SHAME\* \]. I wasn't able to get my willy hard enough during my first time with my partner(5 months ago). All successive 4-5 attempts failed. And then I never tried (till date).

I realized the following few things. 

* I went soft sooner just before the penetration attempts.
* While dry humping, I started to fantasize the pornos that I have been watching.
* After 1 month of P-mode, just after I dry humped with her (I craved to go back home and watch porn) - \[Such a shame, that I was craving for porn even when she is beside me\] - Also the ""chaser effect""
* A very very decreased libido during the P-mode and also when she's around me.

33114,Telling my Story,Stop looking before it is too late,"Hey guys and gals. So, I am using my main account on this, mainly cuz I don't give a flying foot about doxxing or anything. Plus, I try to not be a dick on here, so I shouldn't have anything to worry about. Anyway, let's talk about why doing NoFap RIGHT NOW is so important. 

I have struggled with porn addiction since I was 13. I am now 26. That's 13 years of this crap. Porn kept getting worse and worse until unfortunately, it wasn't just porn that I struggled with. NoFap shouldn't be just about porn and masturbation, IMO, but about all sorts of sexual deviancy. I am big fan of hard more because of this. Anyway, when the porn wasn't enough I started sleeping around. Most of the time it was safe sex, but sometimes not. As a result, recently I got diagnosed with genital herpes. IT SUCKS. but TBH, there is one benefit. 

Ever since the diagnosis I have lost all interest in porn and masturbation. It is literally something that just hasn't had the pull it once had. I still get hard, I am still insanely attracted to women. But now I pass posts online that I would have mixed a batch to before, but now I just scroll right on past without a second look. It has been a jarring wake up call.  I found out on the 2nd or 3rd day of the new year, and have been doing NoFap since. It isn't the first time I've gone this far, last time was last year and I went 31 days and relapsed on purpose. 

Why am I telling you this? Had I not purposely relapsed, I wouldn't have been looking at apps and stuff that connected me with the girl that gave me herpes. Had I stayed on my streak I may have avoided something that looks like it will affect the rest of my life. Guys, stay on the streak. Tell yourself that today is the day and commit to the goal. Let my lesson be one that scares you or inspires you or whatever to stay on the streak. Address the problems that are causing you to relapse. Don't jump off the streak for the hell of it.

It’s really hard at times, especially when I notice friends and other people putting in half the effort for double the results.

This past week I realized that I basically have an ultimatum to face. I have incredible dreams and visions but they feel so far away that it feels impossible to get there. I want to go to the Olympics, be free of this PMO addiction and all the baggage that came with it, I want a good job, own a business, have a family. But it all seems so far away, and getting farther away. I realized I could either give up, or work so hard, so diligently, non stop, to try and shoot for that impossible task.

I contemplated all weekend what I should do, and today the depression got to me and I relapsed. But last night I watched First Man, and realized something I couldn’t fathom before. If man can walk on the Moon, I can go to the olympics. If man can walk on the Moon, I can quit PMO!!!  And If Man Can Walk On The Moon, I Can Accomplish ANYTHING!!!!!

So I made my choice, I’m going all in. Here’s to having nothing to loose, and everything to gain.  Give it your all, because even if we fail, what better way is there to live?

Good luck.",53,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/akj0if/if_man_can_walk_on_the_moon_i_can_quit_pmo/

33225,New to NoFap,My journey begins today!,"I don't have much to say, but I just started with NoFap and wanted somewhere to write, so I guess a post should do the trick.  


Anyhow, I believe I have a very heavy porn and masturbation addiction, and I am certain this has affected other aspects of my life. In fact, I believe I have developed a very sloth-like lifestyle. I am overweight, have almost no motivation to do daily tasks, and see my life as very boring and tedious routine. Well, I want to change and better myself.  


I will start with the 90-day challenge. It seems scary AF to me going 90 days without porn, but having read many stories here, I believe I can do it. I already deleted all the porn I had downloaded to my computer (specific fetish videos I had been collecting for about 2 years now). Deleting them was easy, convincing myself to do it wasn't as easy though. I had to accept that all that time I spent watching those videos, looking for them, and downloading them I could have spent doing something else. They are gone now, so there's one less obstacle there.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from PMO, I believe I need to better manage the time I spend using my phone. I have found that I wake up just to stay 2 hours on my phone. It takes a HUGE amount of time from my day that I could spend studying.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, my sleep schedule. I need to stop going to sleep at 3 or 4am to then wake up at 2 or 3pm. This is not beneficial as a student, for it is time wasted.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I want to do 3 challenges simultaneously: NoFap, better manage time on phone, and sleep with a more normal schedule.

So I'm going to take it easy this time.I'm not gonna stress much in remembering my days of abstinence...doing so only increases my chances of falling deeper into relapse as I cannot handle the fact that there is still a long long way to go.

So this time I'm just going to live life as it happens and take responsibility for everything I am today...because whatever choices I have made yesterday has made who I am today and blaming it on other things is not right coz I always had the freedom to choose the response.

Now I know it is possible for me to do 10 days and I'm feeling proud of myself for having done that.It is quite a big achievement for me after years of addiction.And I believe I can do better in the coming days.

He was a really cool guy he is in the military. We discuss my problem for like 45 min or more. He encourage me stop before I make things worse without shaming.

Since he is in the military he told of how many soldier suffer of premature ejaculation or erectile distinction cause of the stress they carry. He encouraged me to find a better way to coupe with my feelings. He was worried that I would have problems performing in bed if I continued this habit, that only makes my emotional state decline in the long run.

Here is the problem, during my first streak, I was feeling very well, as if I never fapped before. I didn't feel any urges, didn't want to fap, it was a very calm journey. 

Now I'm feeling the days, it's a little bit harder than before. When I deleted my social medias, my life felt so boring and I have understood the negative impact that social medias can have. I have already fixed that problem. But it's like I'm running at a turtle's speed. Before I would say ""oh already 16 days?"". But now it's more like ""oh only 16 days, those feel like 30"". And one thing I still have to deal with is to make a new vision of women because there are not object. Still now when I see a half naked girl a can't stop myself from watching. Or looking for more. And I'm trying to fight that. So here is my question. Did you guys felt something like this before? 

I know what you are thinking. I'm doing this for myself and not to count the days. My goal is to avoid fapping for the rest ofmy life. I know it's easier to say than do but this is what I want.

One thing that I have changed, and that I know has been a driver to getting me here, is my mindset and concept of what success is. Streaks are good, but they’re not the ultimate goal. Streaks are also not the measure of success. If you’ve not hit a 90 day streak, but you’ve only PMO’d 50 out of the 365 days of a year, that is PROGRESS. 

Persistence and grit is what sets you up for success. So you messed up your 15 day streak? Go again. Do it again, and do it better. This is the mindset that will slowly, but hopefully surely, help you build up the strength to fight against PMO urges and get a streak.

So It happened, I relapsed.
My method against beating my porn addiction this time was quite risky and it would be fair to call it ""Counter Intuitive"". It involved sitting with my sexual thoughts feelings and let them run their course instead on trying to run away from them and not being afraid to be around things that may cause arousal (not porn obviously). 
But I crossed that fine line that I have been walking along... I thought to myself ""if I make it a whole year without porn or masturbation, I'll buy myself a Fleshlight."", Which is probably the dumbest idea. 
I started looking at them seeing which one I would like and which are the best, but I got really caught up in them tonight.
Then one thing led to another and I rubbed one out.

A couple of things were different though from the times I have relapsed in the past. 
- I didn't feel pleasure, it felt more like an obligation.
- I didn't feel beaten or depressed in the aftermath, I feel totally ok.
- And lastly, unlike other times, I don't want to watch porn just because I relapsed.

I feel like I have stepped in the right direction and I am ready to pick up where I left off... And with a better reward in place.

The only time I had the urge was before I went to sleep. I usually try to read a book or something before I go to sleep to subdue these urges, but last night it didn’t work. I went to bed around 10:30 read until 11:30 and kept thinking about PMO. Around 12:00 I gave in. I didn’t watch or look at porn, but it’s a shame I had a 8 day streak and it goes all to waste.

33760,Advice to NoFap,Wow! Motivation!,"I'm at 28 days, not a lot, but surpassing my former streak by 10 days, so a big deal for me personally. In one of my former posts I noticed that I had started to feel even worse than before I started this, but I just came here to give a small update and maybe a bit of advice to others who were/are in my shoes.

Two days ago, I tried taking a nap because I spent all day rehearsing for a state choir event, and I was exhausted. So I laid down at 6pm, setting an alarm at 8pm. Nothing major, but I normally cannot nap so this is an anomaly in my life (naps). After laying down for about 20 minutes (I have insomnia, sleeping is difficult, and my mind never stops racing) I had a sudden pang of a feeling I haven't felt in literally years. It was a pang of motivation, to get something done. It wasn't one of those excusable ""I'll do it later"" feelings because you're dreading to do it, it was the ""I know I will thank myself later if I do it NOW"". So I leaped out of bed, moved some furniture I've been meaning to so for months and I felt amazing, even cleaned my room a bit. The next day (yesterday) I had the same feeling when sitting at my computer in the morning, to do my homework. You have to understand, I have copied so much home homework just to get out of doing it because I have absolutely no drive, yet I got up and did it (my grades are not poor, I already know most of the content in my classes). After about an hour the feeling faded, but still, the fact that that feeling to take initiative is coming back, makes me so happy. 

My advice is this. If you are struggling with nofap in the sense that you don't feel like you're changing. Give it time, it takes longer for some people. I'm only 16, but I've come to the realization that not everyone is going to be ""normal"" in one week. This takes time, you're healing, recovering. Don't give up, just do something. Force yourself to do things you normally wouldn't do. God bless everyone!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ako0oj/wow_motivation/
33764,Other,"Guys, NoFap just saved me from a wet dream!! Hell yeah","So, I was having this dream in which I was using my phone, and suddenly encountered some porn. I would have normally just stayed there and watched the porn, but my dream-self thought: ""Oh shit I can't be doing this, I'm on nofap and this would count as a relapse! I need to look away as quick as possible"" and finally closed the porn.

I didn't feel any sexual arousal inside the dream, but who knows? Maybe If my dream-self didn't take into account the nofap and continued watching porn, I would've had a wet dream. And I know a wet dream isn't a relapse, but you know, it still has some energy-depleting effects of ejaculation, so I want to avoid wet dreams as much as possible.

33780,Question to NoFap,Wanna quit but the Flatlines are killing my productivity!,"This was my third attempt at nofap and like all times, I relapsed coz of the flatline.

The first week was really great, especially after 2-3 days. My motivation increased greatly, no brainfog, enjoyed gym, less sleep etc.

But once the flatline hit everything switches to the opposite. Basically zero motivation to do anything and not being able to study properly. 

So I end up relapsing thinking that its better to relapse and get back the ‘first week mindset’

I am a med student and we have a test literally every two weeks. I can’t afford to have the flatline mindset during my exams as the college fees are high and really feel that if I don’t score good, its going to waste.

I wanna know peoples experiences about how they got past the flatline and how they felt after it. Also I wanna know if I can feel like the first week of Nofap all the time after I’ve got past the relapse.

For some background info on me. I’m asexual, I used to be in relationships and have sex, but I was also addicted to porn and masturbating. For a time I did it every single day. I always felt terrible about myself after doing anything sexual. Because deep down I didn’t like it and was pretending to be “normal”. In 2017 something happened to me and I am now sex repulsed. I hate sex and masturbation. Not the people, just the acts. Yet I still have a problem with intense arousal sometimes, and I give in. I’ve gotten it down from doing it every day, to now only doing it once per month. A month is the longest I can control myself and resist. I would like to get to the point where I never do it again. Every time I do, I hate myself because I hate sexual acts. I really don’t want to go into details about my feelings on that. But the point is, I just want to stop forever. I want my next goal to be 2 months and then on and on up to a year. I don’t want to do this nasty shit anymore. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/akoiio/i_want_to_stop_completely/

33814,Journal Check-In,Day 11,"Oh boy.  What used to be subtle little whispers in the back of my mind (even when a stimulus presented itself) has suddenly jumped to a rabid, bone-rattling scream for a fix.  Keeping occupied and active has been helping me tremendously, but when an urge strikes, it HOWLS.

I’ve been watching two shows recently (both comedies).  One had nudity (nothing in a sexual context or R-rated, its an old show, made me chuckle, and fapping to it didn’t even cross my mind) and the other had a brief suggestive scene (again nothing near explicit, just strongly implied).  While the first time made me stop after the episode finished and think “Y’know, I probably should avoid this show for now,” the second instance NEARLY threw me to a relapse.  But I managed to fight it off and weather the storm, so thank goodness.

It just made me more aware of how dangerous my head is right now.  My current mental “side-project” is to shut down the part of my brain that acts as this ‘sexual simulator’ and stop it from running with things.  It seriously gets ridiculous sometimes as to what sets me off, to the point where for a good chunk of time, my knee-jerk response to seeing an attractive woman has been to feel guilty.

Anyway I took it again and went straight back to how I was a sex driven ape running through r/seduction like a mad man.  I was settling for any girl with a pulse.

Failures are a way of making us appreciate the successes. I realise now that the more you focus on nutting the harder and longer it will feel and the less likely it will happen.

33879,Advice to NoFap,"If you feel the urges rise, look at the reminders of why you started doing NF","I'm making this a rule for myself, as I'm fed up already with how many times I've already failed, and this rule might help others as well. 

Write down your reasons as to why you started No Fap. What you want to improve, how you want to end up. It can be on a piece of paper, on your phone, or on your computer. 

For example, if I'm on my computer, I quickly hop on here and browse the success stories, check the emergency motivation button etc. I also have a folder on my desktop with screenshots of my own comments from YouTube on how miserable I used to be and how I want to improve that.

On my phone I also took a screenshot of what I want to achieve and use it as emergency from now on. I also set my background to a reminder of this path I must continue on, which is No Fap.

I'm currently thinking whether or not to draw something and stick it on the wall in front of my desk, plus writing down a few rules, so if I need quick motivation/inspiration they are most likely already in my sight. I'll most likely do it tho.

If you notice the red flags of a relapse, don't try to convince yourself that it won't hurt if you do it for a bit, or take a look at certain social media profiles. It surely will snowball into something you cannot control, and you will most likely lose the streak. 

Rather go and take a look at what made you start this journey, read the success stories from here, go for a walk, meditate, exercise, take a cold shower, anything that keeps you away from those destructive thoughts and instead benefits you with something. 

PS: Also it might help if you have a friend that you can tell about this. Maybe you can do No Fap together, or at least he/she can support you through the urges. If you don't think No Fap threads, screenshots, or pieces of paper will do the trick for you, quickly  message your  friend about this and he/she might provide the motivation you lack in that certain moment. Sometimes just the need to have a longer streak than your friend might prove sufficient enough to get you back on track, but always stay true to yourself and don't lie about it. If you relapsed, you relapsed, you need to be honest. Otherwise you'll soon end up with a ""60 day streak"" but you'll be exactly the same as you started the journey, or even worse, since you're now hiding the fact that you're still addicted.

So, I remember that I tried to abstain from fapping around a year ago and it went quite well. It was so easy to abstain for like 3 months or so. Then I kinda lost the point of this nofap thingie (in a sorta good way, I guess? Cause I never went too far, like, getting depressed and stuff. It was under control in some sort of way).
But rn I'm about to turn 19 and I try to stop fapping everyday, yet everyday it gets worse and worse after I moved from my family. 

 I saw this video of a guy explaining nofap and he said that it's always better to share your problem with your friends and I can't even imagine how to start this kind of talk with them. Like, I even have a girlfriend to share this with, but I won't, that's why I'm typing this text at 2:00am rn, because I just want to share this problem with someone.

33977,New to NoFap,Feels good to feel good 😊,"Known about this for years...but I've always convinced myself I could control my masterbation habit, which was the furthest thing from true because when I consciously wanted to refuse the action, I felt some tendacy/craving to just pop up that incognito tab..and game over. I've hit 90, 30, 20 day streaks + countless 1 weeks, 2 weeks and ultimately after relapsing each time I ALWAYS regret it and not only feel mentally fogged up but spiritually dirty. Cherry on top I had a hernia surgery and now this is the reason I must put this bullshit to bed. Had the operation 2 years ago, however each time I wank my groin, where I had the operation feels extremely sore and achey, lots of pain. I feel that fapping contributed to my injury initially due the fact I was an athlete and competing 3 times a week and hitting the gym 5 days a week..add in beating your meat twice a day and for some folk ( me I believe) your muscle will eventually become overworked and something will tear. 

So I'm 11 days in, got laid for the first time since my surgery yesterday, doing yoga daily, eating clean, feeling lively and confident this is the best thing for me. I really recommend using something to transmute your sexual energy (for me yoga), because urges will come and go but the more tools you have, the better geared toward success you'll be. Side note, if you know anyone involved with AA, they go down a very similar path and can shed loads of insight on healing addiction.

To me its the worst thing you can do on nofap. Watching porn would be better than edging.

Edging is like being clean from crack but still sitting next to someone smoking it to smell the fume. It will lead to relapse.

34041,Relapse Report,Relapse and personal insights,"I had a 12 day semen retention streak going, I peeked at porn a couple of days ago which then lead to a full relapse today.

I have been flatlining pretty hard. Feeling asexual, zero motivation to do anything other than slob around. Didn’t feel like reading, journaling or watching anything new. I put a documentary on yesterday and had just poor concentration watching it. 

I had pre-booked a pickup / day game coaching session in central london and went for that today. I felt no real drive to talk to any girls. Even very attractive girls, the ones i did approach, once I was in front of them I didn’t have any real drive / killer’s instinct to try and chat them up. This feeling of asexuality and zero motivation really made me fall back into PMO today. It was a feeling of hopelessness. 

The one thing I did realise today today though is that I am deeply addicted to porn. The fact that I flatline so hard shows me that my mind craves that dopamine and opiate hit that seeking out the perfect porn video and masturbation gives me. Today was the first time I can remember where (after the relapse) I felt afraid for my future due to the realisation of how deep this addiction is.

I’m literally afraid for my future. I can’t go on like this otherwise I will be alone for the rest of my life. PMO kills my self esteem, motivation/drive, emotional resilience and social skills. If I engage in PMO oftentimes I find it hard to speak to people afterwords due to a combo of these things.

I have to get back on track. I have to get through the horrible flatline period and just accept it for what it is. If I have to sleep through it then so be it. I have been doing cold showers, they were helping me through the flatline for a while, but today the flatline caught me out. The flatline felt like unchartered territory to me and I wasn’t brave enough to keep walking through this proverbial eerie wasteland to see what’s beyond it. I have to be brave. When this feeling comes along again, I need to come on NoFap and read other accounts of the flatline so I know it’s OK temporarily operate as some kind of zombie. 

If I peek at porn then it’s an immediate reset.

Anyway, rant over. Thanks if you read this.

34061,Relapse Report,Things I learned from a 38 day streak.,"I feel like total garbage because I just ruined a 38 day streak. My gf is helping me deal with all this and I really don't know what to tell her. It's the longest I've ever gone, and I plan on doing it again, but for the moment it feels like garbage. Depressing news aside, here's what I got out of it:

&amp;#x200B;

Martial arts helped me with feeling better about myself and increasing my resolve, while the exercise kept me from having urges all the time. Also gave me a little bit of a safe haven at the studio.

I started working from a coffee shop instead of from my apartment. Got to know the baristas personally, as well as meet a whole bunch of cool people and even get a lead on a new job. So Coffee Shops are an unbelievable blessing when it comes to resisting PMO for me.

Reading completely destroys urges. Find something you like and keep it on you at all times. Chidi was right. Give 'em mad  books.

34213,Telling my Story,"""One of the first times in nearly 8 years""","Okay so here it goes.  For years of my life, I was a severely lonely individual with very little people skills and definitely no chance of getting anywhere near a girl. I made the age of 20 having not lost my virginity or even so far as kissed a girl. Id accepted my fate. Not that I wouldn't find a girl, but simply that I would never be able to act to make it happen. This here set forth the founding of my porn addiction. I love porn, I always have. The total escape from the social anxiety and total fear that I got from being around women. Just what I wanted to imagine just a click away. I knew it wasn't anything like real sex and I knew that women would never do half the things in those videos, but that would matter, right?  Not for someone as alone as me. I wouldn't create an unhealthy expectation of sex and disappointing experiences, because that was never going to happen to me. 

But it did. 

She's the love of my life and very soon we are going to be celebrating our 2 year anniversary. Okay fine, some may think that's a short time scale to be saying that shes the love of my life and one day I'm probably going to marry her. But I can say that without a doubt in my mind. She works with me in every way imaginable. I had to push myself so far outside of my comfort zone just to talk to her. But despite my inexperience, low confidence and anxiousness, everything just fell into place. - I'll skip the rest of the soppy bit but basically, she's the one.  

So why am I posting on here? Because I still watch porn. I still love porn. Not because the sex with my girl is not great, because it is. It's stunning. I just find myself addicted to porn. I find it hard to stop and I never really considered even trying until I found this sub (admittedly while I was searching for porn on Reddit) a couple months ago. At the time I thought it was great and actually quit porn for good, I unfollowed all provocative accounts on several formats and even deleted a porn blog that I ran on Tumblr. I lasted all of 5 days. My girlfriend helped with the physical temptations but I was soon drawn back by I don't know what, curiosity I guess? Soon I was back to watching just because I was bored or I couldn't sleep. Sometimes I would watch it not even to masturbate to, just as a break from studying Id watch a few videos just like people watch youtube. 

Its been like that for some time now but tonight I have just finished watching ""Don Jon"" a film about a guy who had a porn addiction because the girls he was sleeping with never gave him the same satisfaction, until he found this older lady who taught him the magic of sex when both people lose themselves in each other. And I say magic because it is, I've felt it, Its not the wet sensations around your dick its the moment you look into her eyes and feel an almost supernatural connection with her. Now in the film, he is able to give up porn once he realises this. I can't help but feel this is my next move. I'm in a beautiful relationship with a girl who can genuinely satisfy me. I don't need porn. I want to feel healthy again. 

So yeah I'm giving up porn, and hopefully for good this time. Tonight for one of the first times in nearly 8 years I'm not going to secretly go searching through porn sites on the iPad hidden down the side of my bed. Tomorrow I'm not going to open up the incognito tab when I can't be bothered to apply trigonometry to a problem. It seems like such a drastic but simple task all the same time. I don't have a target yet. I just don't want to give myself the opportunity again. If you read this far, thank you.

We all know him. He used to run our lives. We followed his commands and submitted to his will. Every time we fed him, he grew stronger, his voice grew louder.

  But recently I decided to take back control. I cannot feed him any longer; for I was starving myself. I was weary, and felt that I had nothing good to offer the world. Beaten down and a slave to my monster. I couldn't live like that any longer. 

  I have not fed him in 9 days. He's getting increasingly agitated. He knows that each day I grow a little stronger and he a little weaker. He is persistent, but I will prevail. 

  I can feel him becoming desperate. Knowing that once I reach a certain strength his control will be completely lost. He is not stupid. He knows my habits and weaknesses for he has been with me since I was a boy. Sometimes he whispers promises, sometimes he shrieks in agony, but he knows I hear him. 

  I know I hear him; I do not deny it. But I do not submit as I did before. I look him in the eye and tell him who is in control, that I no longer answer to him. I call him out on his lies and tricks. I tell him that he can no longer hide in darkness; the light has been shined upon him. 

  Every day I fight for my strength. The battle is not over and I don't know that it ever will be. But I know I will never be the same and I will fight with intensity and courage now that I have tasted a drop of victory.

34398,Journal Check-In,Day 2. Happy to be back in the community.,"Hey guys, I'm glad I found my way back into the community! 

&amp;#x200B;

I first encountered NoFap around four years ago. My life was stuck in a dead end at that time, but with NoFap the real changes started. I found joy in sports, quit alcohol &amp; tobacco and did an insane social transformation. 

Although I completely abstained from P for about two years, I could never really present an outstanding streak in M&amp;O - the longest lasted about two months I guess -, but whenever I hit the two weeks mark, my social skills went through the roof &amp; I loved it.

However, the last year has been a tough one. I started working in a marketing agency and while the job is thrilling af, I basically live in the office, work on tough deadlines and sometimes get more responsibility than I can handle at the moment.

So I turned back to PMO in one of my weak moments, hoping to get a fast relief &amp; using it as an escape route. And boy, your brain gets used to it fast. 

A few days ago a good friend told me about his struggle to abstain from explicit content and how whenever he did NoFap, his life got significantly better. I'm so thankful he reminded me to come back here.

**Just in case someone wants to know how I relapsed without PM or sex:**

My last relapse (3 days ago) was pretty dumb. I didn't watch porn or masturbate, but I was sleeping and entered a state similar to that of lucid dreaming. You're conscious, yet halfway to falling completely asleep, but it's not a dream. Turns out that, for some reason, in this state you are extremely sensitive to sexual thoughts. You can fantasize for 5 seconds and ejaculate already. So I accidentally entered this state, and then intentionally fantasized about my favorite hentai character. I had an orgasm in around 5 seconds. Woke up, checked my underwear, and indeed it had semen on it. So it counted as a relapse because it was a self-induced wet ""dream"".

&amp;#x200B;

So, what are your thoughts on this? **Masturbating for a semen examen is definitively a relapse, right?**

34638,Relapse Report,Mission failed,"So I went full PMO free for almost a week (just a few more hours) after masturbating at least 6 times a day and having sex roughly 4 out of 7 days a week. Ended up masturbating but I kind of expected it, going from that extreme to not at all was a huge change.


I told *all* of my sexual partners that I wasn't going to be having sex or doing anything sexual as I wanted to discover myself, they was all fine with it and we're all still friends. I told all my sexual partners but I no longer speak to my ex. About 20 minutes ago she somehow had my number and called me, I forgot her number and answered and she was masturbating on the phone. After like 8 minutes I gave up and masturbated too.


My ex is very attractive and her moans make me insanely horny, still do this day. I've blocked her number again and I'm going to get a new phone number once the month is up and then block her number on the new SIM so that she can't do it again (she didn't know about going PMO free, she said she was horny and had no one to go to).


.------------------------------------------------------------------------


I guess I'll make this an almost 7 day update too.


I've been waking up with very intense morning wood every morning and just fantasising in my head. Only thing that is different is that I've noticed I wasn't actually horny 6 or 7 times a day, I've been waking up with morning wood but I'd get erect on my own once a day so it must have been me being bored before this. I'd end up my penis in my hand while very erect and just holding it but this time I'm gonna stop that too.

34861,Telling my Story,Observation and Analysis of emotional states in PMO (II),"16/1/2019

Once even the initiator chemical is dumped in brain its already over because you are so wired up for OPM that even an little initiator chemical will shut the rational mind and put you on auto pilot thus forcing you to do mild search of women which will, within seconds, turn into full OPM relapse. So in early stages of quitting whenever you feel the initiation immediately cut the access by force. 

If I convert the above scenario in boiling frog analogy then you are so wired for OPM that even hot cozy water will kill you so forget about boiling water a little warm water and it’s over. Therefore first develop strength to sustain the initiation by cutting the access by force.

​

18/1/2019

As soon as the excitement is produced by initiator chemical the mind immediately switches off and automatically want to search mild material but since I have blocked out access by k9 software and have thrown away the password so the thought of actually searching mild material or opm automatically cuts out and gets lost in millions of other thoughts of mind because now the mind knows that searching mild material or opm is not available thus the effect of initiator chemical is lost and the rational mind takes over had I had the access this initiator chemical would have shut the mind and before the rational mind could take over I would be already in boiling water of mild search and thus ultimately relapsing on full opm

This cutting access with mindset of mythology of sirens and Odysseus is really working wonder.

Observation

The chemical dump occurred just before sleeping but due to in-access of OPM material I went to sleep and thus in the morning I was back to normal state.

​

Cutting access theory can also be supported by my bad habit of playing with hairs once the hairs are gone and head is bald the access is removed all the urges of bad habit to play with hairs is gone and once the hairs are back the access is back and the bad habit automatically kicks in.

20/1/19

Opm image from past generated in head and the fantasy of that image keeps on building generating excitement in heart and with this excitement the rational mind immediately went off but thanks to Allah he kept me back from relapsing.

I did not had access on computer but I had access on mobile so mind immediately wanted to search opm on mobile but Allah kept me back from relapsing. I immediately started to do the analysis and started to write about my feelings thus the emotional excitement subsided and furthermore I pictured Odysseus and sirens case in mind and reminding myself to cut access and tie yourself up. This mindset also helped me to subside the emotions. **Mindset of Odysseus mythology and observing and writing about the heightened emotion revived the rational mind into action thus stopping me from relapsing.** **Thus it’s certain now that immediately after the chemical dump rational mind shuts down the only way to revive and bring to life the rational mind is the cut the access and writing the emotions in details so that rational mind can come to life and stop relapse.**

**Thanks to Almighty Allah who showed me the path and helped me all along.**

​

**21/1/19**

After last days heightened feelings **after sleeping the mental state kept normal throughout the day** without any chemical dump and heightened feeling.

**23/1/19**

**Cutting access is also an important tool in cutting thoughts.** Because as soon as the opm thoughts originate it immediately comes to mind that I don’t have access thus the opm thought is immediately discarded without producing chemical dump and I start doing some different task rather than lingering on opm thought. Thus cutting access not only stops initial chemical dump put also stops thoughts to linger on in mind.

(Add this strategy to stopping a thought)

**Throughout this day opm thoughts are being generating and being discarded by mind due to non-availability of access.** **Cutting access mindset has far reaching benefits.** Had I not cut the access I would have relapsed by now.

**Night was tough, as I went to sleep opm images start to emerge in my mind and unintentionally I also started enjoying them this resulted in touching myself but I was saved and went to sleep**

**But after sleeping for one hour I woke up** and there was an **intense crave** for opm as a result big chemical got dumped in blood heartbeat went up and rational mind went off and **even the cutting access mentality did not worked** I wanted to just use mobile and consume opm and my rational mind was so dead that I made up mind that I will consume opm but I was saved by Allah and put to sleep.

**Conclusions**

**When you wake up at midnight there is crave for OPM which is actually un-controllable**. **Due to sleep rational mind is shut of complete and mental model of cutting access don’t work and with chemical dump in blood the relapse is imminent** 

**In such situation solution is to not to touch yourself, not to enjoy or create any OPM thoughts by yourself and to go back to sleep.**

**Remedy**

Solution to such bizarre problem is to just hear the heart beat note emotions and immediately try to go back to sleep and don’t think and about any fantasy a little thought is detrimental in this scenario. In simple words you must go back to sleep.

**24/1/19**

In morning things were normal but there were after effects from last night. Mild after effects these mild after effects went away when I got busy studying.

**Night was rough especially when I woke up at mid sleep however the mindset to not to touch yourself, not to enjoy or create any OPM thoughts by yourself and going back to sleep worked in such situation.** 

**Conclusions**

**Knowledge about something removes its fear and allows you to fight and handle the situation in more systematic way ie if you have already made the mental model and have already figured out the solution you can deal situation in more confident way, with clear mind and without being fearful of the condition. As soon as the chemical got dumped I did not got afraid that I was going to relapse or did not got confused how to deal with that emotional state rather i remained calm because I knew that lot of chemical is dumped and solution is to cut thought and let the body normalize. Thus knowledge about that condition allowed me to fight and solve the condition without getting fearful and in systematic way**.

​

**27/1/19**

This is 12th day since I gave up on OPM but this time I am not feeling any irritation or anger produced by cravings, as compared to previous times when I wanted to quit the reason for this is that this time it’s confirmed that Allah is helping me and secondly the cutting access has helped a lot because now mind knows that I don’t have access to opm stuff so it’s no use even to create the fantasy so as soon as unconscious mind generates and opm image the rational mind immediately discard it without lingering on it as it now knows that it does not have access to opm and thus not even a minor chemical dump occurs and thus no cravings are produced

34877,Motivation,Relapse is normal,"Relapse is part of the fight against porn.
There is no fight without loss. Its part of the game. But its also part of the game to stand back up keep fighting over amd over again.

Nofap without relapse is illogical. Its like seducing women without getting rejected. It will eventually happen.

The thing is if you tell yourself ""i wont fap for the rest my life"" then youre a liar to yourself.

Fapping is not like drug relapse its different. Its driven by our desire to procreate which is normal.

Your dick is between your legs 24/7 you cant escape it which makes it harder, because drugs can be put out of reach (like nocotine etc)

Just remember if you relapse. Dont think about destroying your dtreak of e.g. 60 days. Think about how long you were able to endure the fight against your hand on your dick.

Hell, dont even count days. Just do it. Personally cpunting days makes it worse. Just have an app that counts it for you and look at it eventually once every week or so.

34882,Success Story,You're stronger than you think,"My nofap story , in 2017 I had a really bad breakup, and I was really down, I use to fap twice a day and the more I fap the more I felt down, I started to date a new girl but since I wasn't recovered of my ex she left too, After a week I again met another gal but she lost her interest after awhile, then I started to notice a pattern and realized I became a sexual addict and because I'm fapping but not having something real I became really desperate, yes porn do make you more desperate and in my opinion that's the worst side effect, so on May I took nofap challenge and slowly best think I noticed I stopped being desperate, haha even there were incidents where I ignored girls really rudely I was like ' I don't know you, you haven't won me, so what's best you can give? Sex? I'm not hungry of it, win me if you want me or else idgf' , yes it gives you lots of energy and also gives you extra time to think about what you should do, I started doing tae kwon doe, learned dancing and gave 100 priority to my looks ( search me on instagram aryaman.a.singh )and by the year ended I decided to take some rest from being so serious and jumped back to dating and how I get gals? I just started to reply the gals in insta and fb whom I ignored earlier, dated 2 girls and been in a relationship for few month with 1 girl in 2018 1st 2 months and dated few girls here and there because I prefers to been uproached, in my experience nofap is the biggest power 1 can have, youre saying to yourself that I'm not slave of  my impulses, that you can't buy me because you'll give me sex, that you're here for higher purpose to achieve. And this thing makes you magnet, if I chooses to approach girls I would have dated many but I don't give it priority  I believe if you're ready universe will automatically gives you good mate, so boys in conclusion I would sat focus on your purpose, these girls are going nowhere, be the one who they would desire and don't let your impulses control you.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/akz4ep/youre_stronger_than_you_think/

34892,Advice to NoFap,Things I've done while on no fap,"During my No fap journey I've started to do these things that really hepled me out. I'm hoping those who are struggling and having a hard time with nofap finds these activities useful in some way.

Journaling- Occasionally writing my thoughts down. Writing whatever happened whether it was minor or major hepled me reflect on a lot of things. It gave me a sense of peace. Also, it's interesting seeing the person you were if you re-read them over-time.

Trying puzzles- I never really liked puzzle games but after sitting down and actually trying some they have really helped. Sure they can be boring and hard but they have strengthen my mind and I seem to approach challenging situations with a different perspective making them easier to solve. It's also a pretty good way to kill time :}

Working out and actually taking of my body- Simply trying to your physical appearance really makes you feel better. I use not really care about working out or trying to look good. Due to watching porn daily (about 3-4 times) I felt no real motivation to improve myself and simply accepted that I'm nothing. But now that I started to really improve my body I had a boost in confidence overall happiness. No more waking up feeling like trash.

Meditation- I found to be more at peace with myself and everything around me the more I just meditate. Using that time of silence to calm down after stressful days and find a sense of acceptance. I end up feeling calmer than I've ever been in years.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/akz89b/things_ive_done_while_on_no_fap/
34900,New to NoFap,Started for the first time 2 weeks ago but reddit led to relapse,"I’m new here and started around 2 weeks ago. However I recently relapsed and now realise that I really need to post in order to receive all the support that this sub offers. 

Anyway, I lasted 7 days on hard mode for my first streak and was checking this sub whenever I got urges. Ironically I ended up looking at non-nude pages here on reddit. Basically I’d never used reddit before and the conveyor belt of stimulation hit me hard. I then talked myself down but ended up MOing to the fantasy later. 

Could’ve been a worse relapse but it’s better than the daily porn I’m used to. Here’s to beating 7 days. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/akzax4/started_for_the_first_time_2_weeks_ago_but_reddit/
34901,Advice to NoFap,New Way of Viewing Urges &amp; 'Superpowers',"Currently reading from ""Think and Grow Rich"" By Napoleon Hill. I need to share this section of the book about Sex Transmutation.

Hill writes: 'The transmutation of sex energy calls for the exercise of will-power, to be sure, but the reward is worth the effort. The desire for sexual expression is inborn and natural. The desire cannot, and should not be submerged or eliminated. But it should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body, mind and spirit of man. If not given this form of outlet, through transmutation, it will seek outlets through purely physical channels.'

This gives me a new light to view urges. It's very natuaral to have urges, every human does. As we go through this journey of NoFap, we are focusing this energy into areas of our lifes we never knew was possible.

34906,Relapse Report,What ive learnt from 12 relapses,"1) nofap can't be done through motivation..
 its better to not watch any nofap motivation videos because it keeps reminding you that your doing this ""challenge"" but what you should be doing is trying to think about nofap less day by day until it becomes a lifestyle

2) meditation is a must 
Without controling your thoughts which pop up in your head I guarantee you will fail
It will help you to erase almost all your urges within days and all you have to do is give it 10mins of your day 
I recommend watching tutorials on YouTube if your new to this practice

3) change your habits to stay busy 
I know many nofappers have told you this but here's something new 
Try wim holfs breathing exercise it will boost your energy levels then use that in your workout and whatever activity that will keep you busy..
You really don't need to take cold showers but take a shower before sleep hot/cold and go to sleep early (most of the trigger come at night when you're alone) I recommend cold showers cause the natural heat the body produces after a cold shower is somewhat calming which makes you go to sleep faster

4) RECORD WHY YOU ARE DOING NOFAP ON YOUR PHONE!!! (important)

One of my nofap friend gave me this amazing idea to record why Im doing nofap and in which you say out loud about your struggles,goals etc and whenever you feel like your about to relapse you can listen to your past speak and remind you about your dreams and purpose
(THIS PERSONALLY HAS HELPED ME ALOT)

5) DO NOFAP WITH A FRIEND / FAMILY 

It's tough when we fight a battle alone and by adding a friend in you can fight it together 
Or you can turn it into a competition and let your competitive spirit keep you from relapsing 

These are the things I learnt 
I hope you found this helpful

34948,Emergency - Help!,I NEED SOME SERIOUS HELP :/,"Two days from now, I'm going to find myself in an impossible situation where I think I'm going to relapse! Sound weird? It wouldn't if you were in my situation.

I started NoFap last year since August(I'll save that story for a later post) and my longest streak until now is 43 days. I had my mock tests this month and to be honest, they didn't really go well, but I'm 100% sure that if I study dedicatedly in my upcoming study holidays I'll score amazing marks in my exams which are scheduled to be conducted in March this year. And if I score good, I have a bright future ahead of me. So bright, I can get away from this darkness once and for all.

Okay, so you are probably wondering what my problem is. Hear me out. Last time I scored awfully less marks, my dad got really angry and since then, I think he has lost all of his faith in me. This time, I'm really afraid what's going to happen. Maybe he'll throw me out of the house. Maybe he'll give me a tight slap on my face( I deserve it anyways):/ or he'll probably blame me that I'm not doing well because I'm watching porn ( which is obviously not the reason). I started NoFap because my dad caught me watching porn twice. Once in 2017 and once in 2018. The second time I realised I'm watching too much and found this subreddit and started this amazing journey.

When I first started NoFap, I shifted my fap time to study time and couldn't get any streaks longer than 2-3 days. But then I replaced my fap time with TV shows(go on, judge me) and my studies and it worked like a charm. I got a 43 day streak. My highest of all time. The relapse was a careless mistake but now I'm already on a 20+ day streak. So the first thing I'm afraid of is if my dad is not supportive after my huge debacle in my mock tests or he yells at me or does anything which would lead me relapse eventually?? And no, no one knows that I've been doing NoFap and I don't even have an accountability partner or something.

Now for the past few days I've been working out as soon as I wake up for somewhere around ½ to ¾ hour and I found out that by doing this, I stopped having urges for the whole day. 

So I made a plan for my study holidays(roughly 3 weeks).
Starting from 5 in the morning, which roughly goes like:

WORKOUT-STUDY-EAT-STUDY-EAT-STUDY-EAT-STUDY-SLEEP and REPEAT


And whenever I'm bored of studying, I've picked out a few novels and some music in my NOKIA 2210 which is going to act like my anti-relapse thing. Whenever I feel the urge to fap I'm going to listen or read one of them and I've picked out enough to last till my exams. Previously, whenever I felt the urge, I watched some episodes of some TV shows which don't have triggers and my urges would go away. 

So the second thing I'm afraid of is will those novels act as a good substitute to the TV shows or I'm gonna end up relapsing? 

Whenever I think about the situation I'm in, I overthink the mistakes I committed in my past, how my life could've been way better if I hadn't taken some series of really bad decisions. And since I don't know how to stop this overthinking, I tend to waste a lot of time by think about it. And a lot of times, stuff like this has led me to relapse. Ugh.

So, dear members of NoFap, how'd you tackle similar situations? Any type of guidance you can provide me with would be great. And I put a lot of effort in converting my mixed thoughts which I was overthinking into this post. I feel a lot of anxiety and even the thought of suicide has crossed my mind. 

PMs are welcome and highly appreciated!

I can talk hours about it but here is not the place , I am a procrastinator myself and I always waited for a INSPIRATION to turn into MOTIVATION so I can finally get to ACTION but 99% of the time it doesn't come. This book had an amazing view on this exact subject , It pointed out its not a chain rather its a loop , lets say ur inspired and it motivates you and motivation get u to do stuff ( action ) even tiny small epsilon of a task  , finishing the task gives you the inspiration and thus starting the loop all-over again. The ""Key"" is simply seeing it as ACTION &gt;INSPIRATION &gt; MOTIVATION , motivation is ur reward not the thing that gets u moving .

How does this relate to NoFap ? you have a lot of free time and lot's of things you want to become plus u have massive amount of energy twirling in ur body,   Why not start doing stuff and when u finish use the motivation to start the next thing u want to do .

What always gets me is the peeking. My current streak is 10 days and I haven't done any peeking whatsoever - up until two hours ago. I got a sudden urge to check what new videos had come out on my favorite porn sites, and so I did. I also checked for hot girls on Instagram. I spent about 40 minutes just searching for news pics and videos. During this time, I'm hardly even aroused and I'm not masturbating either.

Right now I'm having a hard time getting this stuff out of my head. I feel like a complete relapse with masturbation and orgasm too is inevitable because every time I've peeked previously I've failed in the coming few days.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know if there are any guys out there that have been on a perfect streak, peeked for a bit, then went back to the perfect streak? Is it possible to return to NoFap without a complete relapse?

So there's this girl in my class who is kinda cute, and she said she doesn't like Venezuelans (I'm a Venezuelan guy who migrated to Mexico for certain reasons).

Oh boy. This gonna be lit. I'll make her like me through NoFap just to prove her wrong! I'll do the 90 days reboot, so that she will feel attracted to me, because guys who reboot are more attractive to girls, right? 

Hell yeah. She will sense my testosterone aura. Her subconscious will be like: ""oh shit, this guy's got seed, I need to get him!"" and I'll prove her wrong. And I'll give no fucks. I'll reject her unless, of course, I get to like her. But the point is that I'll make her like me just for a mere challenge!

Wish me luck bros. That girl's gonna fall for me. Or my testosterone aura really.

35178,Journal Check-In,Where did the time go?,"It feels like just yesterday I started nofap, asking people this and that about it, etc. and I’m here to give advice on how i made it 21-22 days with no relapses on my first go and what worked for me:

• beginning, the urges were insane, I basically wanted to stick my penis in anything and everything, but after about 5-6 days these urges past.
• next, 6-14 days, a lot of rubbing against sheets, etc., but no PMO. It was quite a form of edging late at night but I refrained from doing it excessively and it helped ease the temptation to M for some odd reason.
• after about 2 weeks, personally, I have kind of just stop caring to masturbate or watch porn. I assume I’m in some form of flatline right now? Not sure. Either way though, I’m all about not having such interests in fapping.

Benefits:
• my hair seems a bit more strong and thick, even though I wasn’t really balding to begin with but have damages because of bleach. My facial hair has become notably thicker, especially my stache.
• some days I have INSANE energy, want to workout, etc. I feel like a whole new man.
•Girls have been hitting me up out of nowhere, I guess nofap gives you energy and confidence and just something about you makes you more appealing in a way? Not sure, but it’s happening.

Cons:
•my dick fees lifeless when I don’t get a random erection or something, whereas before It was always ready to see pmo come it’s way. Crazy.

35203,Telling my Story,"Losing a 110-day streak has truly humbled me, but taught me to keep fighting","*September 15, 2018, Friday night*. Browsing the internet with tears and desperation in my eyes. The day I discovered NoFap, r/NoFap, and YBOP. The turning point of my life, or so I thought.

&amp;#x200B;

*January 3, 2019, Thursday morning*. After 110 days, and atleast 2 flatlines (each lasting 20+ days), I was finally broken. The heavy drinking from NYE caught up with me, and a lazy day on Jan 1 and 2 led to loads of edging, which led to masturbation on the 3rd.

Do you want to know what was going through my head after masturbating? Arrogance. If I could go 110 days in 2018 starting on a horrible night, I could go 362 days in 2019 starting on a normal day. One masturbation couldn't ruin my day, right? Wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

*1 hour later*, I started watching porn. 3 hours later, second relapse. Next morning, more porn, another relapse. This continued for 10 days, with atleast 1-2 times of masturbation a day, and hours of porn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, out of nowhere, a streak. From nothing. The surge from the 5th day felt wonderful. I started feeling alive again. I missed that feeling. I thought I could easily repeat my 110-day streak this time. No big deal, right?

&amp;#x200B;

*Day 7*, relapsed. And then I relapsed every single day for 10 more days. Before I know it, I've done PMO 20 days out of 29. Great start to 2019, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

From being cocky and arrogant about my ever-growing streak in 2018, I've been brought back down to earth. I know I'm human. There are indeed things that can break me.

What I learnt from this experience:

* Loving yourself and going easy on yourself are not always the same thing
* Don't look around you or compare yourself with others. Just because you have a 10 (or 30 or 60) day streak doesn't make you superior to everyone else. NoFap isn't the be-all-end-all scale for determining who's better.
* Your streak is only about you. This isn't a competition, stop treating it like so. This is only about you. Focus on happiness, success, and any other personal goal you've set for yourself.
* NoFap is more than just staring at your streak all day, posting memes on reddit, hating over porn or pornstars or posts about PMO.
* Blocking everything on your phone and laptop won't stop you from masturbating.
* Never ever edge. Just don't. 
* Never think ""I can repeat my 110-day streak any time I want"". NO. Being arrogant and unprepared against the urges will leave you ruining your life yet again.

Maybe this time I can actually build up a streak, and beat this addiction once and for all.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/al3pe3/losing_a_110day_streak_has_truly_humbled_me_but/

35275,Telling my Story,Starting my NoFap journey [25 M],"Warning: long post.

TLDR: I’m fucked and have been fucked for about 15 years. I want to be a functional man.

I’ve tried to start this journey several times before however I’ve always relapsed due to either my motivation wearing out, or by punishing myself after rejection or feeling sorry for myself.

I found porn at the age of 10 and my parents found out by 12 that I was viewing porn however I was a rebellious kid and never listened to them. I learned to dry hump the bed, sofa, carpet... at one point I even managed to orgasm to concrete in a tiny room containing a fire hose.

I can only ever remember being a timid and repressed person around women (once I started ‘noticing’ them) and after a recent relationship I’ve realised that I don’t even know how the best version of myself would handle relationships, love, and a life partner. I’ve always managed to sabotage my relationships, and I’ve never been in a relationship with someone under an hour long drive away.

Last year I became aware of my sexual dysfunction when I was unable to experience a happy ending at a massage parlour and I proceeded to fix this by spending all my money on hookers and massage therapists, which made it easy to abstain from PMO. I hated that the sexual activities in these places was all about me, and to make things worse... the main website where found the prostitutes was called cracker.com... like I am contributing to breaking these women down 😭 nonetheless I kept going. One time, I was with a woman who seemed like she was underage if not a really neotenous woman of Asian heritage... I ended up reporting her details and address to crime stoppers but I still engaged with her 😭

While in recovery, I found myself getting into a long distance courtship which was progressing well until my porn-founded fears drove this woman away. I then started punishing myself and my progress by rebounding / relapsing to porn... often watching group sex pornography and associating said woman with the actors on screen. I thought it would help me to deal with my feelings, but it only made things worse.

Following this, I berated her constantly seeking her attention and an explanation on what happened between us until I had destroyed everything between us.

This lead to depression that lasted about 4 months between September and December of 2018. I also missed out on NoFap November. By this point, my savings had been completely used up. The last of my money I spent on a brothel and vowed to never return to such places.

Fast forward to this year, something finally clicked on 11/1/19, where I realised that I hadn’t wished a Merry Christmas nor Happy New Years to anyone at all.

I decided to go back on my word and visit a sex worker, if nothing else to actually tell a woman that my penis probably won’t even work but I’d like to spend some time together. This finally worked out last Thursday, 24th January. I visited a brothel asking for a massage however they no longer provided massages late at night, so I just went for the full service. I told her about my dysfunction and we settled for a massage and I had enough time to give her a massage in return. The time ran out just as I finished the massage on her and she loved it and I was dripping so I extended the time however as I entered her I suddenly went limp... which lead to blue balls.

That’s when I looked for some information on how to alleviate the pain and came across [this](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/morgan-taylor/busting-myth-blue-balls) article on blue balls by Morgan Taylor— specifically the point that delayed ejaculation gives men more energy, clarity, and focus, and, that it can increase and sustain dopamine.

So I decided not to resist... and it worked. For a couple of days 😭

During this time I even found courage to tell my dad that I’m abstaining from porn and that my mood may be off for 6-12 weeks and to please have patience with me during this time.

Then I relapsed PMO’d on Monday. Then I remembered this ex (so-to-speak). Then I PMO’d again on Tuesday.

Even though I was only successful for 3 days, I feel like I understand the brain fog aspect of this.

Anyway, I’ve been trying all night to give myself blue balls but it’s just really hard because my body responds correctly to me (MO). After about 3 or 4 runs in the past 6 hours, I’ve only managed to deplete my biological bank which also kinda hurts, but it’s not what I was looking for.

That’s why I’m here /r/NoFap. I need help. I’ve spent pre-puberty and puberty depleting myself of testosterone. I don’t even know what the best version of myself is like if I’m being holistic and what the best version of myself needs to pay attention to in life, especially regarding a family. I thought I could tackle this once I have a partner, but I don’t know if I even have it in me to be faithful to her once this dysfunction is sorted.

I want to start things by doing a NoFap Feburary. It was my excuse when I first relapsed after the prostitute on Thursday, and I want to follow through with it.

I don’t want to fail again /r/NoFap. Not after seeing what this mental fog really is. I downloaded the NF Emergency app, but I am afraid. I essentially have a day left before Feburary begins and I need to succeed. Please help me. I appreciate all the help I can get. That’s really all I can say given I have tried and failed many times before, even disregarding the story behind this post.

35327,Journal Check-In,I learned that my body issues probably come from chakra issues,"I recently read “Eastern Body, Western Mind” when I sat down the past few days to try to finally figure out what’s wrong with my body... 

I got a pretty strong feeling that instead of the possible myriad of illnesses I could have... candida, digestive issues, gut bacteria imbalance... it seems that I most likely have issues with chakras. 

What’s most obvious, from the book, is that I follow the schizoid / creative archetype, where all my upper chakras are overdeveloped, and all the energy is in my upper chakras, while my lower have issues. 

The archetype is someone who is excessively thin, in their head, body failing, movements are quick and rigid, stressed, and one of the most accurate descriptions which I match, is what they called “contradictory breathing” where the stomach goes in during the inhale. Normally it should go out. 

~

So my root chakra has been messed up most of my life... At a young age I learned that my parents basically had me accidentally, and in my opinion, they should have never been together in the first place... Knowing that my being brought into the world wasn’t intentional and by two people I consider to be sociopaths that were *terrible* together is something that is very hard...

And so it seems to make sense that my 1st chakra is quite obviously messed up. 

~

My second chakra is also suffering... This one is tricky as well. I have always been against unintentional sex, and I would say have had quite a difficult time finding women who are compatible with me. 

According to many chakra information sources, sexuality is meant to be integrated into your life, which may be a part of healing the second chakra. The book “Eastern Body, Western Mind” admitted it is exceedingly difficult to find a partner with the level of consciousness to be capable of sacred sexuality, let alone all the other elements necessary in a healthy relationship. 

I’m pretty much completely against casual sex... and for now it seems to make no sense whatsoever to go on dating apps or go places with the intention of meeting women. 

I did get a powerful “download” that I would receive a life partner and that I couldn’t do anything on a conscious level, or egoic level, to bring her to me, other than to follow my path and continue to develop myself and self-realize. 

I’m at a loss when it comes to both first and second chakra healing. 

Finally, the last very obvious chakra issue is my throat chakra. Perhaps it’s just the group of people I am surrounded by, but between 25-50% of the time I am ignored when I speak. 

I tend to speak mechanically, quickly, and overtly intellectual. I want to learn to improve my speech, heal the throat chakra, and no longer be ignored when speaking. 

~

I’m at a loss. It’s as if many aspects of western society are specifically designed to mess up your chakras as much as possible. 

I was in academic institutions most of my life. 

Mental ability was praised above all else. My body energy wasted away after virtually my whole life hunching over at desks. 

No one around understands this level of issues as well and my natural energy tends to be too intense and too serious for most people to want to be around.  

I’m on this spiritual life mission and most people are willingly putting their blinders on living on the wavelengths of debauchery and hedonism. 

~

The silver lining is, at least I have begun to uncover the problems, because before I was completely ignorant to what the hell was wrong with me.

35379,Motivation,25 Reasons to do NoFap [old golden post],"I was making my ""Why"" list and found this old post here in r/nofap and wanted to share it with you guys:

-------------------

1. Spend lots of time engaging in other productive activities that will turn you into a much more qualified person.

2. Quit objectifying women, start seeing them as human beings.

3. Much higher confidence, trust and pride in self.

4. Be a free man who wanders at will. No more a desperate slave with no control over self-fate.

5. Start feeling these intense emotions all the time, instead of being numbed to the beautiful world around you. No more the walking dead.

6. Much less procrastinating. Get things done on time, resulting in much higher success at work or in school.

7. No more scared to let other people use your computer, no more fears of being caught.

8. Burst with newfound energy. Run Forrest Run.

9. Start - possibly for the first time since puberty - to really love yourself for who you are. The self that you always loved but unfortunately kept locked away in a self-built prison in your body, now has the opportunity to break free and come out. Grow that child into a man. You will find peace of mind in him.

10. Much less depression. You’ll keep finding yourself feeling happy and positive for no apparent reasons, at the same situations where you used to feel worried and distressed before. This is because no matter what, you know you have given your best.

11. Regain that long lost ability of actually falling truely, madly, deeply in love with someone. Caution! Get ready to shed some tears, because you may end up desperately thinking about that one SO, instead of getting hypnotized stupid by all that fabricated and useless, zombified novelty in porn.

12. Grow the ability to maintain a healthy long-term relationship where you can actually be trustworthy, dependable and reliable and can deserve to receive the same treatment in return.

13. THE ED. Inevitably caused by the PMO addiction. Need I say more? NEED I SAY MORE?

14. After a long enough streak, you will see that people around you will start caring more about you. The reason for this is that, before NoFap, one half of you was completely missing from their sight. That one half was busy wasting himself away in a life of secrecy built on shame. He was not present. That half of you did not exist in the real world. And the other half that did exist in the real world was constantly insecure and double minded in his attitude, never being able to give his best because of the PMO addiction. Now people will start to care more about you because you will be at least twice more present in their lives. And when I say present, I mean PRESENT. INFLUENTIAL. IMPRESSIVE.

15. Increased overall physical health, because you are keeping your sperm in your body. Read about it.

16. You can add to that health by actively working out too you know, which you probably will, because NoFap is much harder without hitting the gym anyway. Get. In. Shape!

17. Master your knowledge on how the plastic structure of your brain impacts your behavior. This new modern insight into neuroplasticity is an eventual and positive side effect of doing NoFap through YBOP and will have its positive impact on every aspect of your life depending on what you do with it.

18. Be much more creative than before. You are forcing your brain to leave its biggest comfort zone. That means it has to come up with new neuron pathways to survive. Those new pathways mean new ideas. New ideas mean better creativity in whatever you are keeping your brain busy with. Innovate your life.

19. An immense increase in willpower. One badass lion of willpower. How hard could anything be, compared to quitting PMO? No match ever. No barriers could stand a chance against you.

20. Attention Magnetism. If you’re doing it right, you will inevitably be radiating all this positive energy wherever you go and everyone - especially ladies - will be noticing you out of nowhere. They will look at you, they will want to talk to you. It’s serious and works like a charm, but when you come to think of it, it's nothing magical really: Nature runs its course when you run yours.

21. Piece of cake to initiate dialogues, especially after a certain point. You don’t even have to think about it. Much less self-consciousness.

22. No more of that creepy feeling of two personalities one of which you always have to hide and makes you feel like you'd almost rather commit suicide than found out. Honest with self, honest with all. You are one and whole and complete.

23. No, you are never complete and will never be. Always room for development, since you have the time and the energy it takes to improve yourself in any aspect.

24. Get rid of other bad habits as well. NoFap initiates the good domino effect for your life.

25. Be 1 in a 1,000,000. Really.

In contrast;

1 reason to do PMO:

1. Numb yourself so that you can maintain a vegetably satisfied life instead of achieving all these real traits, unlike a human but like a zombie, where, in the long run, the lack of all these traits is inevitably going to take its toll on you, quiet terribly I assure you.

Now, is there even a match here? I don't want that. You know PMO is something VERY idiotic when it has the mystical power to turn off your conscious and make you blindly ignore ALL THESE VERY CRUCIAL REASONS. PMO is THAT stupid, if you know what I mean. So if there was one single medicine that would give me all those benefits above, I'd pay all I ever had to buy that. Apparently there is none, but there is NoFap. I will give all I have to do NoFap and to run from PMO, because I know I have to and there is no other way around my life.

Best regards and best wishes to all Fapstronauts!

35644,Journal Check-In,The great arises out of small things honored and cared for 1/90,"I saw a post on youtube about porn rebooting and the video expressed the adoption of cornerstone habits: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Daily Meditation 
2. Exercise 
3. Proper Diet 
4. Good Sleep Hygiene

&amp;#x200B;

I figure if I can frame my day around these I effectively earn my day of sobriety. I want life, I don't want some mindless pleasure that takes life away from me. I am probably the hopeless type who will have the hardest time recovering. My story is full of so much hell that I wouldn't know where to start. I would be lying boys and girls if I said I didn't want to relapse or drink or smoke or sleep all day. I am going through absolute hell, the lowest point on my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is strange is that when I am on the road to recovery and string together days of progress things seem to work out well. In 12 step recovery programs they say doing healthy things add to the insurance that you won't relapse *(do good feel good)*. Today I attended acupuncture and made an appointment with an addictions/emotions counselor that may be a good fit for an old guy like me. I have a lot of trauma to process, and a lot of trial in front of me yet. Though, today as long as I make my way to the pillow without giving in to a possible urge I will have earned this day, and I will be proud to chalk it up a ""**W**"" tomorrow morning. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think one benefit of having so much free time currently is I can focus on my sobriety. I am looking forward to meeting with my new counselor to learn about the addiction process and what is happening in my body before, during, and after an urge/relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke with a friend in a recovery program and he did an intensive with an addictions counselor. He told me that the brain can create a stress response in order for the brain to trick itself into taking its' ~~medicine~~. I thought that was pretty profound.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of anecdotal insight on my own recovery process that I am looking forward to sharing during my journey. I think I want to use my story and insight as a way to help younger people struggling with PMO. They say your story will become your greatest asset. One cool thing is that I am starting from the beginning. Addiction is inherently disassociate - I *NEED* to be around people that understand. I love this community, and I look forward to healing with you all. All that considered - talk to you all in a day or two. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

&amp;#x200B;

To Recap: Cornerstone Habits will frame your day positively. I made appointments with outside professional help to assist with my addiction. Seek to use NoFap as a way to stay accountable with y'all with the intention to help others.

Just a random thought that, maybe, this time, everything is going to turn out alright? Even though my streak has only lasted two days at this point, I just know deep inside that this is going to be the time that I get past this. I've loved starting to do this challenge. It's made me look at what I need to improve in myself, what my downfalls are, and what I want to do with my life as a whole.

It's not just about getting over a crippling addiction (which it is), but rather about self-reflection and self-improvement. I know what my goals are, and NoFap has made me face the reality of those goals and stand up to the temptation and struggles that come with them. I really do think that discovering this platform has moved my life in a new direction, whatever that direction may be.

Before now, in my previous failed attempts, I've felt like my life was out of my control and that I was just trying to roll with the punches. I don't know what happened, but suddenly I see my life in a new light. I know now that my life *is* in my control, that it's not a constant struggle, and that, no matter what I do with it, it's going to turn out alright.

If you are trying to do this challenge because of the health benefits, or because of self-control, or whatever it may be, just remember: this might just be another little thing to solve in your everyday life, but it could have bigger consequences than you might expect. I know that I started this in that same place, and have just finally found out why I needed to do it in the first place.

35670,Confession,I met true shame today because of this scourge,"Like many of us have had at some point, a spank bank, I had a tab open with a cloud storage service that I've used to store porn, a collection from throughout the years. I had originally had it locally stored on my phone and computer, but then moved it to this online storage as a step towards leaving it behind.

Well I was going through my tabs and it popped up, my fucking computer lagged and got stuck on that tab for a few seconds as I was helping one of my parents with something on the computer, obviously they saw it and kind of freaked out understandably, especially as they're very religious and socially conservative with this kind of thing being a big taboo.

I've been fighting all this for months, about half a year, lots of relapses, made a lot of progress, but never had it in me to part with my years old collection. Well I've fucking had it now, fuck this, this isn't who I want to be reduced to in the eyes of my parents and others. I told them I used to watch that (porn) and that I've been changing as a person and put all that BS behind me, and I mean it. I deleted everything, it's gone and I'm rid of it.

This was a big wake up call and I think a harsh reality check that is another milestone in my journey against PMO.

35707,Journal Check-In,Behind the Act,"Possible triggers ahead, nothing really descriptive but it might bring up your own memories. Be warned.

So I relapsed last night, as my flair will tell. I was watching a video I had gone to multiple times before, as I hadn’t been able to get it out of my head for most of the day. I had pushed it out of my head multiple times, but it just seemed to keep coming back. Under stress and feelings of frustration from a recent relapse, I gave in later that night. 

I watched the video and committed the act, almost immediately regretting what I had done, again. But it wasn’t that feeling I’ll remember. It wasn’t the shame and guilt, or instant disappointment, or even the feelings of failing yet again. What I won’t be able to forget was the look in this girl’s eyes after I had finished with her. I remember thinking that she looked tired, incredibly tired, and I had never noticed it before. I don’t mean physically tired, I mean the kind of tired you see in the eyes of refugees, war veterans, or victims of extreme trauma. I mean full mentally, emotionally, spiritually exhausted. Her eyes looked much older than the rest of her body, like she had hidden age beneath her skin. 

And it bothered me, not only because I had a glimpse kind of torture she had done to herself, but because I had seen the same look on myself whenever I looked in a mirror. 

So before you click, or even think about going back to porn, think. There are people who have suffered grave consequences already for trading the gift of their sexuality, and we are among them. But it’s not too late to recover. Join the fight today and stay in it for life. I know I will, and I won’t soon forget the look in those eyes.

35719,Victory,Three Days in and Couldn't Love it More,"Hey all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been battling with my PMO addiction for quite some time now. My longest was around a 30 day streak which happened twice, both of which happened while I was talking to a girl I really liked (different girls - but I guess the dopamine rush from talking to a crush prevented me from feeling like I needed PMO? Just a theory :P). 

&amp;#x200B;

Something funny about when I start a new streak though is that whenever I do I feel like while it's difficult to maintain, I get ridiculous strokes of good luck that I definitely wouldn't get if I was on a PMO streak (for lack of a better term). For example, the past 3/4 days of NoFap have been the best few days I've had in a WHILE - talking to my crush more, being more confident, deeper voice, enjoying life more, spending time with family more - life just feels beautiful. 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, NoFap is equal to more luck, more love, and simply more life. Just felt like sharing with you all - I hope you all keep your streaks going and motivate me to keep mine going as well. Upwards and onwards brothers!

**How do I achieve it:** Given my track record with NoFap it seems this is the most prominent issue in my attempt to NoFap. However, I know it will require immense amounts of self control and support from all of you.

**How will I maintain it:** As I write this my largest streak has been 5 days, with an average of 2-3 between then and now. This is stark contrast from the almost twice daily use of porn. Most of the reasons I do relapse is because of physical temptations towards porn and I feel a need to satiate them. I need to understand that my physical state can be changed at any moment by simply doing another action, and that said action(s) are better than anything to do with porn.

**Can I do it:** Yes.

I intend this to be a lesson with the goal of empowerment and happiness. I quit porn only 25 days ago and I'm at the happiest I've been in about 10 years. 

Since I was young, I've always had low self esteem. My years long porn addiction didn't help.

One night recently I met a girl who seemed perfect for me. Exactly my type. We would joke about everything, no matter how inappropriate or gross. We got along great, until she started talking about dicks. She claimed her last guy was 8 inches, which is possible, but highly unlikely. And I knew ""girl inches"" existed (now I'm familiar with ""internet/reddit inches"" 😁) , so I figured he was around 6.5 or so. I thought I topped out at 5, so I knew there was no way she would enjoy me. She jokingly asked how big I was and I wouldn't tell her, and we both knew what that implied. She was talking to a few guys and picked one of the others to be with.

This girl was ideal, just what I always wanted. Smart, funny, petite, brunette, gorgeous face. I'm half convinced this girl was my subconscious projecting the perfect woman just to have her reject me.

She was just what I needed. I needed my dream girl to reject me to realise how broken I was. I'm so happy she didn't choose me because it would have been a short embarrassing affair. I could see clearly I was in no position to make anyone else happy. 

I set out to change. Shortly after this, I quit porn and jerking off entirely. We all know the effects this has on the body and mind. My mind became unlocked. I could see everything in a new way. It was amazing, but my issue still went a step deeper.

I had rediculous little dick syndrome. The only dicks I've ever really seen are in porn and my own. My addiction to porn had gotten so bad, I had even watched the small penis humiliation videos. Truly degrading stuff. And I had been choking the hell out of mine for years.

The only feedback I ever got was from one vindictive girl who told people it was small.

I believed what I had was not small, but unacceptably tiny.

A few days ago, I discovered calculators that show you where your size matches up. I hadn't measured it since i was a kid. I avoided it at all costs.  But with my new way of thinking, I figured real knowledge is better than guessing. I wanted to know how small it was and how I stacked up.

I've never been more furious with myself. I'm not at 5 inches like i thought. I'm not going to give specifics, but according to numerous scientific studies, I'm in the 95% percentile overall. I'm so dumb. I wasted many of my prime years jerking off and fucking mediocre women here and there instead of fucking hot women because I thought I was lacking in an area that I clearly am not. I've flirted hard with hot girls but I always thought I was less than what they wanted. I could have given them exactly what they wanted. 

There were some hints that i should have seen.

The vindictive girl came back for more. Should have been the first indication that she was lying about the size. My mind obviously didn't accept it.

I discovered I have big hands. I hadn't realised they were large and made my weiner seem small. The ideal girl said she likes to hold them with both hands. My hands dwarfed hers. She could have put them both on and sucked it.

When it's soft, it points down. I never got a good look at it this way because I only saw it from the top down. It's a common optical illusion apparently. It sits comfortably between my legs. Unless I position it a certain way, I don't have a bulge. When I do put it to the side, it's noticeable in anything semi tight. I never had the confidence to wear tight pants because I thought it would show I was small. I've found out mine is larger while soft than most are hard. 

I'm getting angry typing this 😆 I'm so dumb.

The object is my penis and the lesson is that porn is absolute poison.

Tl:dr- porn convinced me I had a baby dick. Just one month without it and some measurements in the name of science and personal growth revealed I usually have the biggest weiner in the room.

I don't expect anyone to believe me, but i don't care. This site is anonymous so theres no reason for any of us to lie here. I had to get this out and there's nowhere else I can do it reasonably.

I'm also expecting downvotes and an onslaut of ""9.5 reddit inches"" club members. I don't have a porn monster dick. I'm quite above average but nobody is going to pay to see it. I just want to show guys struggling that you have a lot of value, even if you believe you're worthless.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/al9c2z/object_lesson_in_the_dangers_of_porn/
35769,Telling my Story,I have been numbing myself,"I have been a member of NoFap on and off and finally decided to share my story. 

I am a college student and from the last 4 years consistently, I have been numbing myself through fapping. Earlier it started out for pleasure but then it turned into necessity and something to take the edge off. I didn't realise what it did to me and it's adverse effect until quite recently. 

So after 3 years, I am no feel anything. I used to love  play sports, engage in conversations with girls, study for hours and now I cannot even get the motivation to get up from my bed. 

Recently, a girl confessed to me out of nowhere and I didn't feel anything. No happiness, no sadness, no sympathy or empathy. Most of the time, my mind is blank without any thought. My grade continues to deteriorate and I still don't show any remorse.

I have finally become numb to life itself.

35771,Confession,Relapsed,Was so motivated going into my 30 day then I just fell off towards the last two days of my streak. Been taking cold showers and I just peeked that all it toke for me to slowly get back into it. I’m not mad. I’m human. But time to get back on it.  -just reset was at day 42 ,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/al9ddj/relapsed/
35777,New to NoFap,So when can I have fun with a girl?,"Okay so bare with me... So I've pretty much fapped everyday for the last decade of my life, sometimes more than once, twice in a day. Have had a few girlfriends, sexually active and all. But I haven't been with anyone in almost a year because I've been too ashamed to talk to girls as a young adult male who still deals with acne. It got worse after high school, tried many over the counter products but nothing ever got rid of my acne. Opt against accutane cus its too much of a risk for me to try esp with myself now at 24 yrs old. Anyway, my acne hit its peak since my girlfriend broke up with me Dec 2017. Was depressed and all, shit hit the fan. Acne was a mess. 

Anyway, my face has gotten better over the last year. Since Oct 2018 I hopped on doxycycline 100 mg daily and differin gel 0.1 for overnight usage and it def helps but I'm still not technically clear, patchy skin, bumps/pimples from time to time every week and all. Better, but not clear. So I took matters into my own hands and did some intense and thorough research about what else could be causing my acne, flare ups, etc. 

FYI I'm a 24 yr old male, actively involved with sports, work out 4-5 days a week, eats very well, rarely any dairy intake (birthday cakes/sweets from time to time), only drink water (alcoholic beverages on occasion but I try not to). But still... WHAT ELSE CAN I DO???..  And then I come across NoFap... 

After weeks of intense research, I've noticed that NoFap is a lifesaver for most guys dealing with hormonal acne. Hormonal imbalances happen when ejaculating, nutrients leaving your body, including zinc etc etc out the door. I understand and realized that I should give it a try.. I mean its tough to try but I'm mentally prepared for it and just want my acne to fuck off. So I started nofap about 13 days ago. Surprisingly (but unsurprisingly heh) my acne started to clear up.  Although I did in fact have a pretty bad surge of pimples come out around the 6/7th day, things are looking decent atm. No breakouts, just taking things one day at a time....

But here's my problem now.. this girl I know wants to start hooking up with me every here and there and specifically wants to start this weekend coming up. What do I do? I don't want to start breaking out again cus I'm honestly fed up with acne, being 24  and all doesn't help my case either. But how and why would I reject this girl? Hell, I want play, I want to have fun. Will one or two ejaculations in one night just ruin 2 weeks of nofapping? I'm conflicted cus idk how long I'm even suppose to nofap for anyways. Pretty much asking if anyone out there has been or still is in the same situation as myself, trying out the nofap and while it is indeed working, will there honestly be a relapse if I decide to have fun with a girl from time to time?

I noticed an addiction to porn tho, its just so fun and releaving when my gf is gone and I am like treating myself and my „me-time“. Well I noticed that porn is not good for me and that I really need to stop. So I am on noporn now for around 2 weeks, its not easy but its okay because I can fap with my fantasies and shit.

Can you tell me what would be more benefits of nofap? Actually I am a little bit scared that I will loose my libido or cum earlier because it all gets collected and not relieved.

All together I am a really high libido and horny person aswell is my gf, it doesnt effect the NoFap to have sex right?

What I realized of this journey is that time is limited . All those hours lost doing pmo are useless. All the thing i do now instead of pmo its crazy. I have to thank nofap for this.

The improvement i have to achieve right now is the negative/dirty thinking. Seeing a female body without thinking sexually of it. Thats my goal now. Every time i see women and start to think sexually i snap out of it. Thats what i do in those situations. 

After all these days you realize a lot of stuff. Life is to short for all this pixel-crap. Real emotions are out there. And their are there for us to be lived.

35966,Advice to NoFap,Things that helped me understand.,"Here are some articles that helped me clarify the mechanics why pornography can be so addictive. Just like when I have a sports injury, it makes my recovery so much faster when I understand the mechanics of my body.

I thought some people would appreciate this.

1. Your brain on porn by Gary Wilson. (you can go to the website where there is a summary of his book if you don't feel like buying it)
2. Just search Gary Wilson up on youtube (he has multiple podcast and lectures about the subject)
3. Watch this vid: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ya67aLaaCc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ya67aLaaCc) (very simple short explanation why pornography is addictive)

Also, when I have days where it is extremely hard for me to abstain myself from pornography, i do breathing excersizes.

For a long time I thought those things didn't do anything for me expect the technique Wim Hof uses (he is the iceman, just google him). After a breathing session I feel more relaxed and composed. Maybe it'll work for you guys too.

This fucking porn industry made us all feel that anything other than a 9 inches cock is worth nothing. Porn has flashed us with images of hung men, using filters and angels of the camera to exaggerate the role the size of the penis has when making love. 


Not only that,  it has reduced women in a way that all they look for is a big penis. Funny enough most women go to bed with guys not even knowing how their penis looks like. 


I am telling you, it is sick. You have no idea how insecure I have been in life. Asking my ex-es to tell me if they have slept with guys who had bigger penis, violating their privacy and living a dark jealous life. Funny enough most of them all said they loved to make love to me and I kept pushing it wven more. 


We should stop being that. People who even have micro penises have fullfilling sex lives with their partners through other means of stimulation, oral sex or toys!

35998,Motivation,Day 30 Motivation for you Guys,"Hey guys so today I hit Day 30 which is pretty awesome for me! This is the second time I’ve ever reached a streak like this. Basically I want to briefly detail the month of Nofap January so hopefully anyone who reads this can learn or feel motivated by my journey so far.
So I decided to start nofap for the new year and I’ve loved it so far. It’s hard to do and is definitely a challenge but it’s so worth it. I added a ton of changes to my daily life as well. So it started as doing nofap and making the resolution to run 365 miles this year. Then I ended up adding to that list of things taking cold showers, sitting in the sauna for 20 min every time I go to the gym, consistently hitting the gym atleast 4 days a week, morning pages, accountability with 2 friends also doing nofap, generally eating better, reading more books, exercising the PC muscle, and intermittent fasting (16:8). I had also made the decision to not date any girls for 6 months a while ago and that will be up in april roughly. And my 90 days of nofap happens the day before my birthday so it’s pretty motivating with that goal in mind. So as you can see a lot of changes have happened.

The results of all of these changes: I feel great, healthy and in shape, I’m more motivated now than I think I have ever felt for this long of a time frame. I’ve set goals for myself and started planning more. I’ve definitely seen my interest in women go up more and I’m a lot more relaxed when approaching them now. As far as attention from women goes, I’m only a month in so I haven’t noticed anything crazy but i did notice this lifeguard at the gym randomly told me to have a good day and she’d never done that before. Maybe I’m just reading too much into that but it was really random considering I pass her all the time. 
Some technical things: it’s day 30 for me. I’ve had 2 WDs this month. One was 7 days after starting when they say your testosterone is at it’s peak after abstaining. I was also wearing underwear on the tighter side of things. The second one was 3 weeks after the first. I flatlined around day 21. It really sucked, I lost a lot of motivation and libido. I started to not have morning wood every day which seriously freaked me out at first because I’ve always had it my entire life. I’ve gotten it again a couple mornings since but not every day. So I’m still pushing through the flatline but I think it’s getting better. I did briefly consider relapsing so that I could know if my sex drive was still there but I didn’t. And I seriously encourage everyone that’s flatlining to push through and not even think about relapsing because of it. It will end.
What I’ve learned so far is that nofap is a tool. Don’t treat it as the end goal. It is a jump starter for you to make smart decisions and learn discipline over your body and desires. A ton of other people have said it but I’ll echo, you need to add new habits to your life along with nofap. Not PMO-ing is one new habit (and a great one) but there’s room for more. I’d personally start with 2 or 3 other good habits you’d like to make including nofap and go from there.
I’ve also learned nofap is about discipline and self determination. I’ve been loosely following nofap for faith based reasons for a few years but was always caught in a cycle of masturbating binges then small streaks here and there. And then it hit me that I wanted to change that. I didn’t want to be a slave in my mind to beating off and sexual things. Fortunately I broke my porn addiction in high school, but I still masturbated unecessarily. And though I’d broken my addiction I still looked at porn maybe a few times a year which always always always left me feeling disgusting and shameful right after an orgasm. And I had a problem with that so I committed to nofap for new year. 
You have to want it more than an orgasm.That takes a while. And even though I’ve committed, I still have challenging days. But I have refused to let my desire for instant pleasure and gratification interfere with the lifestyle I’m adopting for myself. If I say I want to do something then I hold myself to it. My Yes’s mean Yes and my No’s mean No. And so I really mean it and stand firm when I say my penis will not control my actions.
All that said, it doesn’t mean I’m perfect at this. I’ve maintained my streak but if I mess it up I’m not going to destroy myself over it.  Masturbating is not going to reverse all of the new changes I’ve made to my life unless I let it. However, what I will do, because I’m serious about the nofap lifestyle, is I will learn where I went wrong. What did I miss? How could I have avoided this? And I will make changes for the future. You have to be able to forgive yourself for mistakes while also being constructive going forward. The only way you fail is by not learning after a relapse. The only way you fail is if you let your life be thrown into a cycle where you aren’t in control of yourself and your actions.

Guys. You can do this. I can do this.  It’s hard as hell, but it’s possible. And let me tell you something it feels great to be able to know that I have control over myself. 
Goodluck to everyone here, thanks for your encouragement and I hope this helped someone continue with the path they want to take to improve their life.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/alcc0z/day_30_motivation_for_you_guys/

Lets get to the **POINT.** I can't stop **fapping** and watching **porn.** I always feel the temptation when I'm got a low score of quiz, test etc. when someone is more better than my work or when the easiest question asked but i cant remember it. I feel so disappointing to myself and then follow up by stress then **booom! I need to reset the counter.. again.** I started NoFap since june 2018 and my longest streak is 7 days.. is that even an achievement? I learned some things especially never sacrifice your sleep for fapping. Yes im doing it but sometimes i don't. Or after i woke up get immediately the tablet or phone to play my favorite game.. do you think this is the cause of the problem? our wifi open 24/7 and just a spark of little curiosity because i see a anime girl on youtube. Then immediately go to chrome or other browser. I did block the porn site but i always unblocking it. Its so hard to me to say to myself that "" stop playing games and do stuff normally men do"" i dont play bastketball or any sports. i cant play any instrument or i dont always participate i always want is to lay down and play some online games. and **i know that is the problem.** when i feel stress go to youtube watch some videos until i fell asleep. Yes its like drinking until you fell asleep. I dont do stuff at night always in the morning. Yes i have time in the morning because i go to school at 12 nn. i also though of work or simple jugging but here i am laying down then eventually fapping.. then after that i feel so disappointed again. i go to every site that encourage to stop watching porn.. i read quite more but nothing affects me but there is a thingy in yourbrainonporn says "" you need a strong something like hope?"" ( the effect of fapping kick in i cant remember it) A thing that gives you a strong motivation that nothing can stop you for pursuing it. But i dont have any of that i always said that i will stop fapping but still watching then fapping again and again. And i dont want to have that motivation came from financial problem or i fell inlove to a girl but she rejects me because what im doing or maybe i realized it when its too late. As a man i dont want my future girl saw me what i am now. I want that time when she saw me in my greatest possible me. I dont want to dumb her just like i did before. Yes i did Im the kind of person who dont afraid of doing something then when something worst happen i just make another one and learn to what happen ( just like im doing in every game i played or just like in test) I want to be my greatest **me.** (i believe in god) even him i think supporting me.. i guess because every time im about to fall in the temptation something will happen that instantly remove my urges but then i go back again. i think god is so pissed that i dont noticing his help. Im not falling in to the pit im the one who want to fall in the pit. God gave his hand but ignore it. Yes maybe im listening to this community and other website but i dont give a f\*ck. Im a just a guy who falling into the void enjoying the wind passes through me and waiting to hit the ground.

36029,Telling my Story,I thought this was just a coincidence!,"I thought this was just a coincidence and I never linked it to no fap! It's my 23rd day . I have been single for the past , I don't know how many years. I am still single but now I don't have the same desire and validation and gratification need that I used to have from females. I was always desperate. Now I am vested in improving myself and developing my personality and making a career. I have a group of females who actually call ME sometimes to talk to me which is like crazy  for me and the strange part is that I don't lose my cool and remain poised contrary to what would happen if the same happened in the past . I have started continuing my hobbies that I left a long time ago before my porn addiction.

 I started learning Russian and achieved A2 level fluency in a month. I am writing poems, scripts for performances that I one day would like to do on the  stage , along with studying and making my career. 

I sometimes feel low and demotivated but I have much better control on my moods now . I can quickly pull myself up from the downward spiral. I still feel the URGE sometimes but I hang on telling myself that 5 minutes of pleasure is not worth it. It never can be . I have also linked it with spiritually and the chakras which helped me gain more insight about functionality of energy. It's just my way of looking at it . It's ok if no one agrees or sees it that way . But I am really more calm , confident, poised, aware , articulate now.

I'm not porn addicted like some other people - luckily - but I watched usual porn 6 out of 7 days a week and because I also got social anxiety I thought it's time to stop it and just observe what happens. That was like 4 months ago.  


I tried that and always hit like 2-3 days before relapsing. After a while my life was getting better even with fapping so I stopped caring again.  
Now last weekend I caught the flu and thought about what to do in order to get healthy quick. Some years ago I tried out meditation and it worked incredbily well for me so I did that again. While enjoying my newly motivation for meditation I stumbled across GoldJacketLuke again who also made it to roughly 2 years without fapping now.  


So here I am, meditation led me to try it again and this time I feel not like relapsing. Whenever I get the urge (mostly get it outside when I see a hot girl) I just take a deep breath and let go... and it helps!  


Try out meditation. It might do wonders for you. :-)

36179,Advice to NoFap,get off this site (personal experience and it works),"You're trying to quit PMO, but you're still failing, right? Well, you guessed it right. I've been a chronic PMO addict since the age of 12. Two years ago, I tried quitting porn and masturbation but I failed after every 3 days, until December 26 when I thought of doing something that would change everything forever.

Look, the more you check this subreddit, the more you are reminded that you are currently fighting an addiction. The more it creates a worry about the days and the streaks. How long it has been?

I don't intend to ridicule the motivational posts and success stories provided here, they're true and I respect fellow fapstronauts. But right now, the brain is addicted.

Here's what I did that helped my addiction and you could do it too, just try for a week.

\- Quit this website

\- Set up a sobriety counter anywhere, use an app etc. BUT, DONT OPEN THAT APP, keep it in the background.

\- Start meditating, start for two minutes, gradually increasing it to 20 minutes a day.

\- Whenever the thought of PMO arises, just DON'T REACT, that's IT!

As time passes, your brain is now trained to avoid the thought of porn, IT BECOMES AUTOMATIC! a long term recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

In the start, I used to get 10-15 urges a day, it was hard, it's going to be hard being mindful, but with time, you could become a master of reacting to your thoughts. What is rewarded is repeated. Stop reacting to PMO thought and stay still, your brain will stop sending you urges and you'll be free like a child.

Now, even if I see something triggering, my brain is now automatic to never go compulsively and start watching porn. It's calm

&amp;#x200B;

TDLR; I suggest reading it completely but; start meditating, be curious of the urges and let it go. Stop visiting NoFap, and forget that porn ever exists or you are in an addiction. You are free and it's just time to avoid these urges through mindfulness.

36232,Motivate Me,The trauma within me.,"I subbed to NoFap a little less than a year ago. I was motivated and inspired to quit an addiction that I felt was completely taking over my life. Don't get me wrong it was, and it still is. However, as motivated as I felt then I was never truly able to keep a good streak. A week would go by and the urges for release really became something overwhelming. It felt more like a burden to hold such a high standard for myself. I was complacent with my living conditions. I didn't have a girlfriend. I had a decent job that paid well. I was doing okay in school. I was--comfortable--to say the least. So I didn't have the complete dedication to NoFap. Recently, all of that changed for me. Work began to get in the way of school and my mental sanity. I met a beautiful girl who I now have the privilege of calling my girlfriend, and school has been on my heels this semester. After all these events unfolded I continued to be that same person I've seen from the beginning. I have not felt like I've needed to be a different person...no... A more responsible person for my mental health until I met my S/O.

Meeting My S/O was the best thing that could have happened. She being more sensitive to emotions mentioned that I was being different than when we first met. I was emotionally distant. Oddly enough, I didn't feel any different. I thought I was being my same self but, she was adamant. This really strained our relationship. I didn't know how she wanted me to change and she wasn't able to tell me what differences she saw in me. I was heart broken that I wasn't able to see these changes in me, and mostly that I had let her down. After some thought in my room, I realized I have not been feeling any kind of emotions. I've just been droning my way thru life. I realized this had to change if I wanted to continue having anything to do with this girl. I began exploring my heart for signs of life. I was emotionally stunted and I didn't know why. Then, I found it.

It was everything. I have been burning the candle on both ends since I left for college. Work was a major stress factor but the hidden killers were all in my room.
I built a gaming rig around 5 years back. It's a solid rig and can still run just about any game on medium to high graphics quality. So this was a major de-stressor at the end of each day. Or so I thought. I didn't realize how mind numbing and suppressive this routine was until I stopped. I began using the computer for homework only. I stopped watching YouTube, I stopped playing my favorite game, and I stopped watching porn, and  all of a sudden I began to feel everything. Ever fucking emotion flooded in to no end. I cried my self to sleep 2 days in a week. I feel over sensitive. Like I can't take a joke or even a pointed question without internally squeezing the life out of whoever dared to utter the words at me. I don't want people to see my weakness, but I feel like it's the only thing I have left. I guess this is when I realized that I'm probably completly depressed. I'm heart broken and happy and sad and afraid that this will never end. If there is any consolation to my grief, it's that I feel more alive than ever.

I want to go back to my droning. 
It was easy.
But this new emotional shit is cool too I guess.

I hope this is recovery. Because if it's not. Then I see no point in continuing.

Thanks,

TL;DR half my life went to shit, the other half got better. I stopped watching porn, stopped playing video games. I feel different but emotionally worse at the same time. Help?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/alfdoe/the_trauma_within_me/

Fantastic day. I felt really good the entire day. It's amazing what difference ""disagreeing with negative thoughts"" makes. Every time my brain was about to produce an unconscious negative emotion I would immediately compliment myself in some form. When ever I anticipated my brain was about to formulate a negative thought, I would immediately shut it down and not even finish the thought or alter the context to make it a compliment. I felt really good all day, normally I am really negative and depressed.

36321,Motivation,"Nofap has a placebo effect, as well as the hormonal and physiological benefits, and that is an advantage you should use to your benefit.","The placebo effect is usually seen as something bad, just a fluke that needs to be accounted for, in trials for medication you have to know if the person is getting better because they believe something is helping them, and giving them hope, or if what they are taking is actually effecting their cells.  Is patient B getting better taking a sugar pill that they think is an antidepressant?  The act of taking action to help themselves is making them less depressed.  Does a brain dead person have less inflamed tissue if they had this substance in their blood?  Then the medication has a physical effect on the body beyond the function of the brain.  Luckily we are not brain dead, and the placebo effect is something we do not need to overcome or transcend, it's something that should be embraced.

   The placebo effect of nofap can induce your depression going away, your anxiety about the future receding, your new found self confidence.  You may have experienced it briefly when you first learned of nofap.  ""HOLY SHIT!  These guys went through the exact same thing as me..  I THOUGHT I WAS ALONE and would be stuck like this FOREVER... But they got better and so can I..  There is a solution to this problem.""  You get a rush of adrenaline and calmness all at once, as a potential new life flashes before your eyes.  I can be THAT GUY..  

It's no longer who you are, but what you are doing, which can be changed.  It's not impossible.

Hell, it doesn't even matter if you just fapped right before you find it, it's gonna be hard to sleep that night..  Ok, so how did you feel so confident and happy and energized, when you were at day .01?   Because of new found hope.  Something will make your life better, it will make you better again, or better than you ever were.  Your brain gets a jump start, like a car with a dead battery, then it starts charging itself.  Your brain is capable of charging itself, even in this condition of having recently fapped.  The thing we need to remember is that it can do it again, and again.

  Did you just relapse after 10 days and now you think you are back to day 1?  Well physiologically, mentally, hormonal, spiritually, you are not the same as you were on that day 1.  Here the placebo effect of ""DAY 1 AGAIN"" and all the dread that goes along with it is working against you...  You didn't think like this when you first learned of nofap, because you had hope of reaching a new level.  Your relapse took you down a level.

Now it is up to you to believe that you are still much stronger and better off, and that the positive effects are still there, because you are a better, stronger man and have stronger willpower.  If you believe that you are a weak piece of trash bc you went back to the most powerful vice in history, then it is more likely you will binge for the next 5 days and then maybe you really will be as bad as when you started.  Maybe the benefits go away because you're not looking for positive feedback of your progress anymore, just looking for proof that your relapse just completely fucked your life up again and all hope is lost.

 25% of that binge is due to the addictive effects of porn, the other 75% is because you thought it was inevitable, because you didn't believe in yourself anymore.  You lost faith in the last 10 days meaning something and your brain is now looking to prove itself right..    A huge part of mental recovery is believing things will get better, which restores hope.  It gives your mind and soul the extra boost it needs to reverse the downward slide.  Instead of believing that nothing will get better, which really says:  There is no reason to do XYZ because the outcome will be no different either way. to your subconscious, which controls how and what you do.  

In other words, by having faith in nofap, and knowing that the benefits do not go away just because you relapsed, and not beating yourself up for beating yourself off once, you will do much better overall.  Have faith in yourself, that you are helping yourself, and there is hope for you.  Knowing that you are not hopeless, and you are still okay, may be as big a part of nofap as the actual abstaining from PMO.  

I write this looking back on the days when I did use, and just decided immediately I was going to still be amazing that day, that I was going to give it my best, and not let the idea of being a porn user drag me down.  There were times in the past when I woke up with motivation, PMOd and thought ""well today is just fucked now so I may as well not be productive at all..  Time to make a sandwich and sit down with netflix, because that's what fappers do, right?""  I let PMO be the catalyst for laziness, the excuse I wanted.  But it didn't have to be that way.

I don't have a counter, I'm not writing this as someone who has a huge day count behind them, or someone who has beat porn addiction for the rest of my life.  I don't know how well this translates to someone who is at the darkest depth of depression, or for someone who has gone 100 days in hard mode.  It's been about 5 days and I have had release with my partner on those days.   The urge is still there, but surprisingly, seems to be less after reframing it as something less powerful.  Somehow taking away the idea of it completely ruining me makes it less appealing.  The ""forbidden fruit"" is less tempting when it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth, rather than being a deadly poison.  We do not have full control over how it affects us, but what we do, should not be ignored.",61,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/algn4o/nofap_has_a_placebo_effect_as_well_as_the/

36463,Journal Check-In,Major Breakthrough,"I get it now. I understand why I'm miserable and keep being haunted by flashbacks.

&amp;#x200B;

Little refresher on my backstory: I'm an artist who did mildly erotic drawings and then had a mental breakdown when I found out a lot of my peers are in the industry of making very disturbing porn. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been miserable ever since, but I now get why. I'll list the reasons in bullet points:

* I was using arousal and masturbation as a form of self medication. I guess that's the point all of us here share. Rather than flat out porn I would just search up pictures of scantily clad to naked women and excused it to myself as ""gathering references""
* I was conditioning myself to associate drawing with arousal. When I then saw the disgusting drawn pornography and simultaneously took it in on a technical level, like all drawings I see, and on that sexual level, it was the final engraving for this conditioning. 
* This is why I now have a hard time working without having flashbacks and being disgusted
* I now find myself without a coping mechanism for negative emotion because I gave up on looking at any arousing material, while at the same time feeling an excess of negative emotion because me not being able to work properly is causing all kinds of issues in my daily life

Well then. This is all quite unfortunate. I still don't quite know what to do about all of this, but I'm sure the conditioning will go away sooner or later, so there's hope. Not sure how I'll get by until then, but I guess I'll find a way. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/aliaia/major_breakthrough/

36495,Advice to NoFap,Remember this,"(disclaimer: I've been participating in NoFap for a year and it's great. I highly recommend it and this post has nothing to do with boycotting the practice)

&amp;#x200B;

Just because you relapsed, or are on a low streak, that does NOT mean you have to be anxious, unattractive and depressed! 

Stop basing your happiness, mood, anxiety, and confidence on NoFap. I relapsed this morning and during my evening walk I had three girls stare at me. 

A lot of people deal with anxiety, depression and lack of confidence with different ways apart from NoFap. I'm not saying NoFap is bad, it's incredible, but if you aren't that high on your streak that does NOT mean you CAN be confident, looking good and feeling happy. If you get caught in this loop you will end up being more depressed and anxious than before. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh no I relapsed I'm going to be such an anxious guy when I go out now :(""

&amp;#x200B;

""Ugh why did I relapse now I'm gonna have such low energy and feel like crap all day""

&amp;#x200B;

Saying these things to yourself will make everything worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I think placebo is the right word here. You can either placebo yourself into good feelings, or deep into bad ones, and I bet most of you are doing the latter. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you relapse think to yourself something along the lines of ""well that's unfortunate, I need to find out what triggered me and eliminate them from my life. starting my new streak right now."" 

&amp;#x200B;

THAT'S IT! Don't get all anxious about how you're gonna feel like shit because you relapsed and all that. It's a waste of your time and energy and will make things worse down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you guys actually see what I'm saying here.

Have a good day and keep up the streaks!

A quote that has helped me was; “You will never regret not PMO’ing and staying strong.” I know this may seem no that big of a deal for a lot, but it has helped me in knowing that staying strong though all of the struggles and urges will not harm me in any way, but make me stronger. Sometimes an urge gets so strong it makes you feel as if you need to masturbate, and it makes resisting seem detrimental. It is all a trick of the mind. 

It’s similar to exercising. When you attempt to run a mile, your brain tells you that you’re tired or you can’t make it the full mile. In order to complete the mile you must tell your brain, “this will be worth it in the end, I can’t stop. I won’t regret finishing the mile even through I am encountering some temporary pain, but I know I will regret it if I stop before hand.”

36810,Telling my Story,Sex/Porn Addiction Daily Struggle.,"You wake up, grab your keys, head to get a coffee and you see a pretty girl. You immediately start to picture her on her knees as your force yourself deeper into her mouth. You wonder what kind of nipples she has and how they will feel while you bite them. You start smiling at her and start to approach. Hoping she will let you tie her up, you say “Hello” 
Her number was easy to get, this is not your first time. You get your first taste of Dopamine Response that she will provide for you. Wasting no time, you start to text, “Meet for a drink later?” She says yes and off you go. Start the prep for what is to come. A quick shave, make your bed, lay out the pills.
There is one bar you always go to. You go there so much they know the drill. Few drinks, few games of darts to get closer to her. Don’t even need more than a couple hours and its back to your house. You’ve been here before, nothing excites you anymore, you pop half of a 100mg Viagra and you get going. Once she has had her fun it’s your turn. You know what you have to do, flip her over ass up face down. You can’t look at her face anymore, she is no longer the pretty girl, she is just a puppet for your twisted mind. You grab her hair and tighten it as you simultaneously choke her. It’s not enough, you start to picture your ex. Driving this girl’s face into the bed as you picture your ex in the dirt struggling to breath. Your mind quickly flashes from girl to girl of all those who looked through you lies, who you didn’t get to this place. As your anger rises, your grip tightens. You find a small fold of skin in her upper back and bite. Thrusts are like lashings now, your mind traveling into the darkness…. Release.. Another Dopamine Response… It’s over. 
Just as your last bit of excretion comes out, your tolerance for her presence ends too. You wipe her off and walk out of the room. Away from her, away from what she has become to you. You clean yourself off in the bathroom, splash water in your face, and then you slowly look up. The dreaded reflection in the mirror. “This is what you are? This is what brings you pleasure?” Your mind starts to go darker. She must leave now. You find your excuse and off she goes. Only to find yourself alone, with your darkness. With the anger still inside you, you start looking for porn. Something to numb yourself more before you go to bed. Typing in things that you could never say out loud into the search bar. Deeper into the darkness you go. Another Release… The Dopamine Response gets less and less and the guilt more and more. Even more disgusted with yourself. “You fucking loser, you can’t go one night without jerking off. The fuck is wrong with you?” The 9mm on the night stand is starting to stare back at you. Your mind is now in the darkest depths. 
As thoughts of ending this guilt filled and disgusting life start growing stronger. You think about how far you have fallen because this disease. You haven’t had a relationship in years, shit, you haven’t had sex without drugs in about just as long. What’s the point of life? Mind is flooded with hateful remarks and endless questions about why me, why can’t I stop, when will it end? Until finally you drift off into a self-hatred slumber.

Alarm Buzzes. You wake up…. You see a pretty girl.

36909,Advice to NoFap,Asking for advice for a friend - physical symptoms,"I don’t have a penis so I’m unable to help regarding this, but I’m extremely willing to offer support, and have told him about this sub. 

Anyway, he’s told me he excessively masturbates and watches porn a lot, and is aware both are a problem. The issue is that when he doesn’t masturbate. I’m going to quote some of the things he’s said, as it’s in his own words (and have made the physical symptoms in bold):


&gt;So, I'm a daily chronic masturbater, and I always tend to use porn. However, because of it, my sensitivity is, as my brother put it, ""shot"" when it comes to actual sex. However, I've done it daily due to the fact that if I don't fap during the day, **it could lead to a burning sensation when I pee, largely due to excess semen.**

&gt;I finally spoke to my doctor about it, cause I want to make sure I can do right for whenever I get in a relationship, whether it be romantic or FWB(Friends with Benefits). He suggested I cut back to 1-2 times a week, and to start with that ASAP.


&gt;Well, like I said, excess **semen gets stuck in my urethra when trying to pee at night**, causing me essentially be ""constipated"" with pee. There'd also sometimes be **white discharge after peeing** during the day if I don't fap.

&gt;The **burning sensation** happened, and I apparently forgot to mention that it also **causes the pee to not fully come out**. Think constipation but with urine. I forgot to tell this to my doctor, too, so that's a big oof.

I know I will not quit, and I know I will not stop doing this things that are good for me. But I was in day 10, seeing now that is been only 7 minutes without the PMO, makes me so sad

For a long time I thought NoFap was stupid and never took it seriously. Whenever I tried it, I wouldn't make it more than a week and gave in at the first temptation.

After going through a very hard time recently, I just said fuck it. I wasn't getting anywhere with women, was deeply unhappy, and had major self esteem issues.

Today is Day 18 of NoFap, my longest streak. I just got home from my third date with this girl, and I really like her. Every date has went amazing and tonight we got dinner and spent over an hour making out in my car afterwards. She's coming over to my place this weekend.

Trust me, I hate bragging more than anyone. That's not what this is. This post is to remind everyone that it is possible to get the life you truly desire. I never thought I could turn things around, but it's unbelievable how much confidence I have. For the first time, I have real control of my life.

36961,Telling my Story,These are my goals for 2019...,"I have constructed 5 total goals with measurable quantity and I want to see how far I will go with it.


1) I won't relapse the entire year (Day 11 rn and going well)
Note: there should not be any excuse for my relapse and I shall not relapse. I, however if I do find attached to someone, definitely will be involved in sexual intercourse.


2) I will finish reading 10 entire books by the end of the year.
Note: I've never finished a book in my life and sure 10 sounds a lot but you know what's a lot more than the books. KnOwLeDgE and the library of books behind my Lamborghini.


3) I will spend 30 min on learning and improving my career which means I will learn coding for 30 min a day.
Note: it's so hard until you get the right answer, then it feels better than jerking off.


4) Staying away from social media and less cell phone usage
Note: Even though I wait social media a year ago, I still use my phone 10+ hours a day (downloaded a app called Your hour). I have made changes and deleted over 167 apps and I only used 2.5 hours yesterday. Everyday I will try to keep it 5 minutes below than my previous day. I will also barely check in on Reddit once a week and will delete Reddit right after I use it.


5) I will learn to understand different perspective, be open minded and further improve my social life as well.
Note: I will use my sexual energy and use that for my hobbies and things I need to focus on. I also will approach more girls which will fade away the insecurities and shyness I have when talking to them.

37074,Advice to NoFap,Stop Trying to Feel Better - Really?,"If there's anything I've learnt over my journey, it's that *trying to feel better* isn't the solution to this (or any) problem.

It's what leads us into addictive patterns.

We experience feelings, thoughts and/or emotions that make us feel uncomfortable and we've been conditioned to think that those feelings are 'bad'.

When we were young and got excited about something we were told ""calm down""... when we were scared, we were told ""don't be silly""... when we were sad, we were told ""pull yourself together"".

And so we've learned to suppress and numb those feelings. Or to distract from them in any way we can... fapping, drugs, porn, alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, shouting, trying to control the world around us... you name it...

The way out of addictive cycles is to let go of the desire to feel better. That's what keeps us *in* them.

Rather, we need to *get better at feeling.*

We need to learn to accept the feelings going on in our bodies, to accept the emotions—""emotion = energy in motion""—and sit through the discomfort until we get used to it.

We need to learn to accept the thoughts in our minds and just watch them float by. Not attaching to them. Not thinking that they define who we are. But just that there's a piece of brain that generates thoughts, both helpful and unhelpful, and it's up to us to consciously sift those that we want to act on.

When we get better at feeling, we don't *need* to feel better because we recognise that the true joy of life is *all of it;* the downs, disorientation, being wrong, making a fool of ourselves, not knowing the answers as well as the ups, wins and moments of total happiness.

You can be joyful while being sad. Because being sad means you're alive. And being alive is the greatest gift you ever received.

Don't try to feel better. Get better at feeling. Your world will open up like you could never imagine.",57,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/alnvcj/stop_trying_to_feel_better_really/

Downloaded Reddit today.

No fast food. I don't take artificial sugar in any kind.
I do use artificial sweeteners. I eat fruits daily.

I'm studying for a tough exam. I have to study at least 10 hours a day. 

I was addicted to TV series and movies. But I gave up that as same as to the nofap. It was hard before, but I'm used to it now. I do watch YouTube daily during lunch and dinner. I know I have to reduce it too. 

I have limited social contact, but I have kept so because of the exam. Though I'm learning French and there I have interaction with new people. Somehow I'm juggling these two studies. 

But it's hard to concentrate while studying because many times mind wanders off and I start thinking about a girl or so and in few minutes I start edging.

Before I joined, I thought I could do it by myself. Boy, was I wrong. Reading relapse stories, asking for help here, finding others in the same situation, and thinking about one quote that I read here has made this journey easier.

In these two months, I haven't felt shame, guilt or regret that I used to feel when I fapped. My tastes are returning to normal, and although I was a dominant personality before as well, I'm not as afraid as I used to be and have an easier time taking control of the situation instead of just letting others decide for me. Maybe this is because I'm not hiding anything anymore or maybe some chemicals, I don't know.

However, urges are there. This past week I experienced a strong one as well, but I remembered everything I learned here and it definitely has helped me.

Like I said, productivity and community are the enemies of pornography.

37233,Advice to NoFap,"Anxiety, PMO and avoiding triggers","TLDR: success requires more than a choice not to fap, you need to change how you live. I give a few tips on what to change first.

I started NoFap in August. Since then, I've learned a lot. Today, I'm going to tell all of you the most important thing I've learned, and I guarantee it's something you already knew. All of these things also helped me overcome my generalized anxiety. I haven't had a panic attack in over 5 months.

**You need to change more than just your PMO addiction**

The best way to quit is to change your life, change the way you act, the way you spend your time. Do not let yourself even become tempted to PMO. There's a few really easy ways to do this. 

Stay in public areas longer. Don't let yourself be alone. Even if you live alone, spend most of your time outside of your bedroom. Get away from the places you usually go to for PMO. 

Fill up your schedule. If you don't have time to PMO, you won't be able to. Stay busy during the day and go straight to sleep when you get in bed. When you wake up, get out of bed and go do something. It's okay to take time to relax, just do it in a way that won't make you susceptible to temptation. 

Turn off NSFW Reddit. For me, I'm on a few subs that have non-porn NSFW content, so I changed my settings to ""blur NSFW images."" This helps me avoid accidental peeking.

Along those lines, NEVER PEEK. Peeking is when you tell yourself you'll look at porn or something like that (bikini models, Instagram thots, etc.) Whole telling yourself you won't PMO. The problem with that is simple, you will PMO if you make peeking a habit. All of my recent relapses have been due to peeking. 

Recognise that you have free will. This addiction is not who you are. You are an amazing, strong, interesting person. You chose to join NoFap, now you need to choose to change your life. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/alqnqx/anxiety_pmo_and_avoiding_triggers/

37241,Motivate Me,I am lonely,"Hello fapstronauts
I am 16. 
I sometimes get really strong depressive thougts.
They come when I lose at something or when I see others succeed, when I dont.
Today they were really strong.
Theese thoughts came after I saw two of my friends with their girlfriends. I got that feeling of... why dont I have one, I am not unworthy, or am I? I must be unworthy, since I am single although I ask girls to be with me.
The thoughts only got stronger. I almost had tears in my eyes after a friend asked me if I have a gf.
I came home and fell a sleep.

Before nofap, I would cope with depression, lonelyness and anxiety, by watching porn, lots of porn.
I didnt even like fapping that much. It was like a chore.
It would make me forget theese strong emotions, when I would watch it. After that it would get worse again.

Now i dont watch porn, but hey i am still lonely.
I had a nice experience with a girl who had a crush on me about 3 years ago(I didnt even like her, but I was so desperate, and it felt decent I guess) I HAVENT KISSED A GIRL IN MORE THAN 3 YEARS
but I had very strong feelings for 3 girls since then
They all friendzoned me hard.

I will either learn to make sadness(feeling powerless) turn into anger which would make me feel like I DO DESERVE A GIRLFRIEND AND I WILL GET ONE  or I will turn back to porn and alcohol and possibly end my life at the end.

After a streak of a month I realised a surge of energy in me. It was unbelievable! I could actually feel electric waves flow through my body. But I was practicing meditation as well during the streak so it was not only due to nofap but energy level increases for sure, because I have been practicing meditation for quite long. 

Second thing I experienced is that I was less tired and more productive plus I became more active.

There was an increased attraction and attention I am getting plus I have greater influence on others than I ever had. Girls and guys alike are more attracted towards me. I don't know if it is due to nofap or it is just that I notice it more. But the attention I get and influence I leave on others have increased enormously. 

Before nofap I didn't have girls as my friend much but after nofap I have been friends with girls a lot lately and getting their number has become easy for me. I am still single now but it due to my focus been more on my goals.

My perception towards life has changed I don't fear problem nor do I tend to be lazy when it comes to work. I am more focused to my goals than before.

One thing also that I didn't experience any depression or flatline or I might have not realised it due to my work and my focus on my goals.

My advice to you all will be don't give up this benefits are real guys and you will definitely experience it just try to focus on your goals and hobbies, experience life and don't ever give up.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/alr9l3/my_experience_on_nofap_for_over_a_year/

From my experience I can tell you when I retain semen for just 20 days and keep meditation it creates a glow on face and I am being notice in office environment. Whatever I am desired gets fulfilled. 

Even at the age of 40 when charm is gone, sometime I wonders what is this semen which makes people magnet and your taken serious by people.

And when I do masturbation the very next day virtually I feel dark cloud over head. 

About our respected freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi (1947) after few years of marriage he observed celibacy( NoFap)  for the rest of his ife, and its history how he became a mass magnet... he attracted millions of Indian and world people.

37368,Relapse Report,Relapse after 21 days - I’m scared,"Made an account for this, can’t really post/tell anywhere/anyone else.

So let me begin with this, before NoFap my life was like a rollercoaster, constant ups and downs. But when I was on this streak, I was improving little by little, day by day. Of course there were also bad days, but I mean like overall.

When I started this streak I was at the bottom. I decided to delete social medias and made also other little adjustments that would help me. During the streak I have been hitting gym constantly, noticed many benefits etc. Also I think this streak was my record. The removal of social media helped me a lot.

But today I downloaded Instagram back, because of boredom and then one thing led to an other just like in my previous relapses. So today I PMO’d one time. Then realized what I did, so I deleted everything, cleared search history (I hate to do that shit) and came here immediately.

Now I don’t really know what emotions I’m feeling. But one thing I know, I’m scared. I was also a little scared during my streak because I had a fear of failure. And now because I failed, I’m more and more afraid. 

Edit: Also, I can feel the urges coming back again when I’m writing this. It’s just crazy, because I felt disgusted a moment ago.

I feel like I could’ve grown more height, got more girls (I’m not ugly), actually played sports, and be more social in school.

37459,Question to NoFap,My therapist was telling me that there is no real need to masturbate,"He was telling me how masturbating every single day is NOT healthy. And most people, don't constantly masturbate everyday.

And that healthy masturbation, is maybe once a month if that.

Because if you are in a healthy sexual relationship, there wouldn't be a need for masturbation.

And that masturbating keeps you from dealing with your issues. It's an avoidance of life basically. A healthy and confident person is not going to masturbate everyday, or even weekly. It's just not necessary.

And the reason why you get ""super powers"" and look better and more confident is not simply because you stopped masturbating. It's because you CHANGED your way of thinking. If you stop masturbating, that is because you CHANGED your way of thinking. And change is good and positive. So you look better...because you changed for the better.

A girl that frequented the bar I worked at came back home with me and we got down to business. Clothes came off the fun started quickly. I mentioned to her how long it’s been since I had sex or masturbation so I was locked and loaded I guess. She was cool with it and expectations werent high, we just enjoyed ourselves.

We are in my room completely dark and she starts giving me head when I feel the universes infinite power surging through my loins I pulled out of her mouth grabbed her head and exclaimed FUCK!!! What quickly ensued was equivalent to the biggest geyser of bodily fluids I will probably ever see! It would not stop! I think I lost 5 pounds in weight after that nut!

37472,Motivation,I hit 30 days today. I started on New Years. Here’s my tips and the benefits I experienced.,"Firstly, I’m an extremely disciplined person. I lift weights 3 days a week, on the other 3 days a week I train jiu jitsu, I eat an extremely healthy diet with lots of protein, and I meditate and read books every single day. Porn was the one area I lacked in discipline. I always caved in and fapped to porn when I was stressed or bored. I was doing everything right except talking to girls and fapping to porn pretty much every night. My ex had dumped me about half a year earlier and I hadn’t met any new women in college and was just fapping to porn every night.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of the benefits I noticed:

1. Confidence increase – confidence went through the roof after about 20 days, I could stare people directly in the eyes for a very long time and not give a fuck. With this confidence I was also working out and doing stretches to fix my posture. As my posture got more upright and dominant (from stretching and foam rolling) I noticed more and more girls and other people give me glances/or even check me out.
2. Happiness and stress – I started noticed things I hadn’t noticed before and appreciating little things more often. My stress stayed pretty low and my post workout felt 10 times better on no fap.
3. It was easier to wake up in the mornings and get out of bed. My focus and energy levels were definitely higher and healthier.

&amp;#x200B;

As I go further into this journey I imagine the benefits will increase. I’m not expecting super powers. I just wanted to break this bad habit of porn and become a stronger version of myself.

&amp;#x200B;

My tips:

1. Discipline = FREEDOM. If you have the unmitigated discipline to stay away from porn and do the things you KNOW you should do, you will feel happier and more free.
2. You have to learn and recognize what an urge actually means. It means your brain is playing a TRICK on you. It’s trying to get you to relapse because it’s craving that old unhealthy dopamine release that you got when watching porn. You HAVE to realize this and acknowledge it. Next time you get an urge, notice it and then realize “oh my brain is playing a trick on me” and then say fucking no to relapsing.
3. keep the no fap emergency page as an open tab on your phone in private browsing. I did this and there were a few times I needed to open it up and hit the button to get my brain off sexual energy.
4. Learn how to harness sexual energy - This one is the one I still struggle with. I CRAVE having sex, being with a woman, or fapping at times.. BUT you must learn to take this sexual energy and not act on it physically and use it mentally. Use this energy to progress on your goals or help you solve a problem. Sexual energy is extremely powerful shit. If you can harness it, you can propel yourself to becoming a much stronger version of yourself.

37489,Advice to NoFap,It's troubling to me that many people on this sub have such an aggressive aversion to an orgasm.,"TL;DR: Attempting to maintain ""Hard Mode"" well past 90-180 days seems self-defeating, overkill, and ultimately unnecessary.

     At least in my mind, NoFap is about self-empowerment and weaning one's self from being unable to control the urge to watch porn and creating a healthier perspective on sex and intimacy. The belief that orgasms are to be avoided like the plague lest you ""lose your mojo"" like Austin Powers makes little sense to me. Maintaining ""Hard Mode"" for more than 90-180 days seems like  overkill, like megadosing on vitamins with the logic that massive doses of a good thing are even better and that people who take the normal amounts of vitamins just aren't as tough or committed. It mostly seems like a way for people to feel superior over others and looks needlessly restrictive and miserable. To make a comparison to people trying to shake an eating addiction, NoFap's message is more akin to ""eat healthier and less"" than  ""A true Dragon Warrior subsists on water and the dew of the universe."" (Kung Fu Panda reference)

     I probably alienated a bunch of people with this post but I think it needs to be said. We're fighting porn addiction, not trying to gain superpowers by killing your urges like some sort of Celibacy Man. It smacks of the book 1984, where the government attempted to subvert the citizens' sex drive into workplace productivity. While technically possible, the concept was written as a warning, not a goal, and the fact that so many people are shooting for it makes me very uneasy.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/alu625/its_troubling_to_me_that_many_people_on_this_sub/

I would not say this is the only driving force steering me towards change but it has facilitated me to positively change my life.

Changes

-Began the process of transferring from my local community college to a major university.

-Have a set schedule.

-Have been consistently reading and listening to lectures. (If you are interested in a list of books let me know)

-Working out almost every morning

-Studying at my school library everyday

-Waking up early no matter the day

-I barely play video games now (less than 5 hours a week) (used to play 8 hours a day for years) (CoD SnD)

-I got a part time job

The part about girls

I am at a point in my life where I am changing and am not looking for any sort of relationship. I definitely feel a lot more comfortable speaking to people. 

Overall,
I have added a lot of structure and efficiency to my life, I will continue to log my experience. A small downside to this is I have upped my intake of caffeine (black coffee, black tea, ocasional energy drink) to keep up with my rigorous schedule. It’s a small sacrifice for the greatest good in my life.

I’ve read many a thread on how poisonous Instagram (and really any social media) can be, and while I haven’t decided to completely cut myself off from it due to it being my only means of keeping in touch with some of my friends, I’ve stayed away from doing any mindless surfing outside of the people I’m already connected with (all of whom I know personally and trust).  

Interestingly, since I decided to do this, for the first time in my life on Instagram, I’m getting follow and chat requests from bots and NSFW accounts with provocative pics and usernames.  THAT’S been great.  Get a follow request, check to see if it’s someone you know, and instead get greeted with a sexual image that instantly gets the ol’ PMO machine-work whining and hard for a fix.

*sigh*

But it ain’t gonna beat me.  It’s a picture.  So what?  What will it gain me?  It isn’t an actual woman.  It doesn’t hold the promise of a real relationship, real emotions, real sex.  It isn’t REAL.  And I am TIRED of living outside realty and caving to fantasies.  I’m tired of being disgusted with myself and being led pathetically along by this disease.

I’m gonna stay strong and set a new record today.  I hope everyone here can do the same!  🤘",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/alutd1/day_14_setting_a_new_record/

37572,Journal Check-In,"I feel so bad, about that one thing.","I feel so bad because I have never been with a girl. All my friends are very successful on that topic. So, I have no idea how to cope with it. I feel so broke because of it. It feels even worse when people say that you are somehow charismatic and look not bad. My age is almost 20 and just because I never have been in a relationship before that, the feeling of being ashemad arises. The problem is that everyone of my age have already been with someone. So, being unpractised in that field makes me very nervous and unconfident while approaching. I see that some girls show interest in me, but I cannot make it continue from there on. Sometimes girls would hug me and look just directly into my eyes, standing very nearby as if they are waiting for a kiss, but I do not know how to do it. So, I would just continue talking. Once I even invited a girl inside of my house, she came with me, and we were alone inside the house. She would do strange stuff to make me to get attracted to her. Nevertheless, I still managed not to even touch her or do anything on the fact that the girl would agree to do anything at that point.

I wrote it for myself to calm down. But any comment would be appreciated.

Also, I aknowledge the part that it is not fully related to our topic. I don't want anyone to feel bad about it, I just saw that other guys also have similar problems. So, it would be great if someone experienced gives us an advice.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/alv8by/i_feel_so_bad_about_that_one_thing/
